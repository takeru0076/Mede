I like to get dressed up too. But it is not so formal. I mean I usually don't make up. some time use lipstick but that's it. That's all. I am interested it but I don't know how to do it and I don't have any cosmetics except one lipstick. people usually have some cosmetics in house. Even they are mothers' but my mother never make up. She doesn't like to make up because it is bad for skin. and she can't make up herself (she has handicapped) She think that she doesn't need it. Maybe she is not interested it too. Anyway Nobody make up in my family so really I don't know about it.
