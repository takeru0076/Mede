As I sit here facing the monitor, a plethora of thoughts continuously replace each other in my mind. Highly diverse emotions fight each other for expression. So here I am, an embodiment of chaotic emotions. Some of them express joy, some express sorrow, some express excitement, some express apprehension, some express determination, etc. The first thought that comes to mind concerns this very writing assignment - Why do I need to do it? That very thought is replaced by one which says that there is a purpose for everything. Of course, no answer is good enough for a questioning brain, and as a result, this series of questions and answers continues until a third emotion, namely, frustration creeps in and tells the other 2 to stop interfering with other emotions still to come. This seems like a very garbled piece to me already, but well, it is my current stream of consciousness.
