Keller has experienced something memorable for her about her language learning. I can say that human has the complete character of humanity if the senses of human are complete. By accident, people can lose one of their sense an can still survive in the society. However, the most difficult thing is the case of the author Helen Keller who has lost her sight and her hear. I will say that herself is memoir sense she has lost essential senses the most important thing for her is memoir. If I was ask first about what might be the possible answers to educate this kind of people, I wouldn't have any idea about that. She didn't have any problem with her touch so like she said her teacher Anne Sullivan gave her a doll to let her play with that a little while and spelled it with her finger.
