I have an eagle in my country I give him a name It's fars It's a nice name for the eagle I am always spend my time with my eagle every morning when I get up. I go with him for many places in the mountain in to find some food for him. I love my eagle so much and I think he is also. I miss him so much now because he is not with me. Also at the night he sleep in my room. When I just get up in the morning I saw him looking to my face and try to say good morning. and I know when he is in a bad mood or a good mood in his face. I hunt birds by this eagle and I know when he would like to go or not because sometimes when he is in a good mood he make like a sound and move his wings and his tail, that's mean he would like to go out with me now to hunt or maybe to eat.
