who go by the name of texas boy choir lope into town hall last night and succeed in corral the heart of a sizable audience actually the program they sing be at least two-third serious and high-minded and they sing it beautifully under the capable direction of the choir s founder geroge bragg the twenty-six boy make some lovely sound in an open group of renaissance and baroque madrigal and motet excerpt from pergolesi s stabat mater and all of the britten ceremonial of carol they sing be well-balanced clear and within obvious limitation extremely please the limitation be those one expect from untrained and unsettle voice an occasional shrillness of almost earsplitting intensity an occasional waver and now and then a bleat but mr bragg be a remarkably gift conductor and the result he have produce with he boy be generally superior most surprise of all he have accomplish some prodigy in train for the production of word the latin for example be not only clear it be even beautiful

dance company call mazowsze after the region of poland where it have it headquarters open a three-week engagement at the city center last night a thoroughly ingratiate company it be and when the final curtain fall you may suddenly realize that you have be sit with a broad grin on you face all even not that it be all funny by any mean though some of it be definitely so but simply that the dancer be young and handsome high-spirited and communicative and the program itself be a vivacious a it be vary there be no use at all in try to follow it dance by dance and title by title for it have a kind of nonstop format and move along in an admirable continuity that demand no pause for identification the material be all basically of folk origin glean from every section of poland but under the direction of mira ziminska-sygietynska who with she late husband found the organization in 1948 it have all be put into theatrical form treat selectively choreograph specifically for presentation to spectator and perform altogether professionally under the surface of the wide range of folk movement be apparent a sound technical ballet train and an equally professional sense of perform since the organization be create thirteen year ago it be obvious that this be not the original company it be more likely the son and daughter of that company the girl be charm child and the man be wonderfully vital and engage youngster the stage be constantly full of they indeed there be never fewer than eight of they on stage and that be only for the more intimate number they can be exuberant or sentimental flirtatious or funny but the only thing they seem unable to be be dull to pick out particular number be something of a problem but one or two identifiable item be too conspicuously excellent to be miss there be for example a stun krakowiak that close the first act the mazurka choreograph by witold zapala to music from moniuszko s opera strasny dwor may be the most beautiful mazurka you be likely ever to see there be an enchanting polonaise and the dance and song from the tatras contain a magnificent dance for the man everywhere there be little touch of humor and the leader of the on-stage band of musician be an ebullient comedian who play all sort of odd instrument with win warmth
