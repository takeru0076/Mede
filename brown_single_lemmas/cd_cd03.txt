one hundred year ago there exist in england the association for the promotion of the unity of christendom represent a it do the effort of only unauthorized individual of the roman and anglican church and urge a communion of prayer unacceptable to rome this association produce little fruit and in fact be condemn by the holy office in 1864 now again in 1961 in england there be perhaps nothing in the religious sphere so popularly discuss a christian unity the church unity octave january 18-25 be enthusiastically devote to prayer and discussion by the various church many people seem hopeful yet it be difficult to predict whether or not there will be any more real attainment of christian unity in 1961 than there be in 1861 but it must be readily see that the religious picture in england have so greatly change during these hundred year a to engender hope at least on the catholic side for the tide be well on the turn a the london catholic weekly universe have write i come to england last summer to do research on the unpublished letter of cardinal newman a an american catholic of irish ancestry i come with certain preconception and expectation be intellectually influence by newman and the general 19th-century literature of england i know only a protestant-dominated country since arrive here however i have form a far different religious picture of present-day england in represent part of this new picture i will be recount some of i own personal experience reaction and judgment but i primary aim be to transcribe what englishman themselves be say and write and imply about the roman and anglican church and about the present religious state of england since the protestant clergy for the most part wear gray or some variant from the wholly black suit i roman collar and black garb usually identify i in england a a roman catholic cleric in any case i have always be treat with the utmost courtesy by englishman even in devonshire and cornwall where anti-catholic feel have supposedly exist the strong and long nowhere have i see public expression of anti-catholicism on i first guy fawkes day here i find catholic a well a non-catholic celebrate with the traditional firework and bonfire and be tell that most englishman either do not know or be not concern with the historical significance of the day a birmingham newspaper print in a column for child an article entitle the true story of guy fawkes which begin when you pile you guy on the bonfire tomorrow night i wonder how much of the true story of guy fawkes you will remember in the 355 year since the first guy fawkes night much of the story have be forget so here be a reminder the article proceed to give an inaccurate account of a catholic plot to kill king jame 1 in spite of the increase in number and prestige bring about by the conversion of newman and other tractarian of the 1840 s and 1850 s the catholic segment of england one hundred year ago be a very small one four per cent or 800000 which do not enjoy a gracious hear from the general public the return of the catholic hierarchy in 1850 be look upon with indignant disapprobation and in fact be charge with be a gesture of disloyalty in 1864 newman professedly have to write he apologia with he keen feeling in order to be believe and to command a fair hear from english reader now in 1961 the catholic population of england be still quite small ten per cent or 5 million yet it represent a very considerable percentage of the churchgoing population a protestant woman marveled to i over the large crowd go in and out of the birmingham oratory catholic church on sunday morning she find this a marvel because a she say only six per cent of english people be churchgoer she may not have be exact on this number but other here feel quite certain that the percentage would be less than ten from many side come remark that protestant church be badly attend and the large medieval cathedral look all but empty during service a catholic priest recently recount how in the chapel of a large city university follow anglican evensong at which there be a congregation of twelve he celebrate mass before more than a hundred the protestant themselves be the first to admit the great fall off in effective membership in they church accord to a newspaper report of the 1961 statistics of the church of england the total of confirm member be 9748000 but only 2887671 be register on the parochial church roll and over 27 million people in england be baptize into the church of england but roughly only a tenth of they continue an amaze article in the manchester guardian of last november entitle fate of redundant church state than an archbishop commission report last month that in the church of england alone there be 790 church which be redundant now or will be in 20 year time a far 260 anglican church have be demolish since 1948 and in the last five year the methodist chapel committee have authorize the demolition or more often the sale of 764 chapel most of these former church be now use a warehouse but neither anglican nor nonconformist object to sell church to roman catholic and have do so while it must be say that these same protestant have build some new church during this period and that religious population shift have empty church a principal reason for this phenomenon of redundancy be that fewer protestant be go to church it should be admit too that there be a good percentage of lapse or nonchurchgoing catholic one paper write 50 per cent still it be clear from such report and apparently clear from the remark of many people that protestant be decrease and catholic increase an anglican clergyman in oxford sadly but frankly acknowledge to i that this be true a century ago newman see that liberalism what we now might call secularism would gradually but definitely make it mark on english protestantism and that even high anglicanism would someday no long be a serviceable breakwater against doctrinal error more fundamental than it own that day be perhaps today 1961 and it seem no long very meaningful to call england a protestant country one of the irony of the present crusade for christian unity be that there be not relatively speak many real christian to unite many english catholic be proud of they catholicism and know that they be in a new ascendancy the london universe devote it centenary issue last december 8 to map out various aspect of catholic progress during the last one hundred year with traditional nationalistic spirit some englishman claim that english catholicism be catholicism at it good i have find myself say with other foreigner here that english catholic be good catholic it have be i experience to find a many man a woman in church and to hear almost everyone in church congregation recite the latin prayer and response at mass they hope of course to reclaim the non-catholic population to the catholic faith and at every sunday benediction they recite by heart the prayer for england o bless virgin mary mother of god and we most gentle queen and mother look down in mercy upon england thou dowry and upon we all who greatly hope and trust in thou intercede for we separate brother that with we in the one true fold they may be unite to the chief shepherd the vicar of thou son a hymn often to be hear in catholic church be faith of we father which glory in england s ancient faith that endure persecution and which proclaim faith of we father mary s prayer shall win we country back to thou the english saint be widely venerate quite naturally and now there be great hope that the forty martyr and cardinal newman will soon be canonize because they have keep the faith of they medieval father english catholic have always strongly resent the charge of be un-english i have not see this charge make during i stay here but apparently it be still in the air for example a writer in a recent number of the queen hyperbolically state that of the myriad imprecation the only one which the english catholic really resent be the suggestion that they be un-english in this connection it have be observe that the increase number of irish catholic priest and laity in england while certainly see a good for catholicism be nevertheless a source of embarrassment for some of the more nationalistic english catholic especially when these irishman offer to remind they christian brother of this good one of the more noteworthy change that have take place since the mid-19th century be the situation of catholic at oxford and cambridge university at oxford one hundred year ago there be very few catholic partly because religious test be remove only in 1854 moreover for those few there be almost no ecclesiastical representation in the city to care for they religious need now not only be there considerably more laity a student and professor at oxford but there be also numerous house of religious order exist in respectable and friendly relation with the non-catholic member of the university some catholic priest lecture there catholic seminarian attend tutorial and row on the cherwell with non-catholic student far evidence that roman catholicism enjoy a more favorable position today than in 1861 be the respectful attention give to it in the mass media of england the general tone of article appear in such important newspaper a the manchester guardian and the sunday observer imply a kindly recognition that the catholic church be now at least of equal stature in england with the protestant church on successive sunday during october 1960 paul ferris a non-catholic write article in the observer depict clergyman of the church of england the church of rome and the nonconformist church the catholic priest though somewhat superficially draw easily come out the good there be many letter of strong protest against the portrait of the anglican clergyman who be indeed portray a a man not particularly concern with religious matter and without really very much to do a clergyman such a series of article be certainly never print in the public press of mid-victorian england there be so much interest show in this present-day venture that it be continue on bbc where comment be equally make by an anglican parson a free church minister and a catholic priest catholic priest have frequently appear on television program sometimes discuss the christian faith on an equal foot with protestant clergyman a notable example of this be the discussion of christian unity by the catholic archbishop of liverpool dr heenan and the anglican archbishop of york dr ramsey recently appoint archbishop of canterbury the good feel which exist between these two important church figure be now well know in england the holy sacrifice of the mass with commentary have be televise several time in recent month and it be interest to observe that bbc s television film on christmas eve be the bell of st mary s of course the crown event that have dramatically upset the traditional pattern of english religious history be the friendly visit pay by dr fisher then anglican archbishop of canterbury to the vatican last december it be the first time an english primate have do this since the 14th century english catholic react to this event with moderate but real hope almost daily something be report which feed this catholic hope in england statistics of the increase number of convert and irish catholic immigrant news of a protestant minister in leamington who have offer to allow a catholic priest to preach from he pulpit a report that a catholic nun have be request to teach in a non-catholic secondary school during the sickness of one of it master the startle statement in a respectable periodical that catholic if the present system
