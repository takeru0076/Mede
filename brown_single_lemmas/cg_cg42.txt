impressive a this enumeration be it barely hint at the diverse perception of jew collectively or individually that have be attest by they gentile environment it be reasonable to affirm two proposition jew have be perceive by non-jew a all thing to all man some jew have in fact be all thing to all man in the arena of power jew have at one time or another be somebody s ally they have observe correct neutrality they have be someone s enemy in the market place jew have in fact under various circumstance be value customer and supplier or clannish monopolist and cutthroat competitor and so on through the role refer to in the previous paragraph diversity of perception yes diversity of fact yes but the two do not invariably or even typically coincide the conventional image of a particular time and place be not necessarily congruent with the image of the fact a establish over the year by scholarly and scientific research conventional image of jew have this in common with all perception of a configuration in which one feature be hold constant image can be both true and false the genuinely interest question then become what factor determine the degree of realism or distortion in conventional image of jew the work test of the fact must always be the good available description obtainable from scholar and scientist who have apply they method of investigation to relevant situation grant such functional image be subject to human error they be self-correcting in the sense that they be subject to discipline procedure that check and recheck against error in account for realism or distortion two set of factor can be usefully distinguish current intelligence predisposition regard intelligence general grant may have be the victim of false information in the instance report in this book if so he would not be the first or last command officer who have succumb to bad information and dubious estimate of the future but general grant may have be self-victimized he may have enter the situation with predisposition that prepare he to act uncritically in the press of affair predisposition in turn fall conveniently into two category for purpose of analysis to some extent predisposition be shape by exposure to group environment in some measure they depend upon the structure of individual personality the anti-semitism of hitler owe something to he exposure to the ideology of lueger s politically successful christian socialist movement in vienna but millions of human being be expose to lueger s propaganda and record after allow for group exposure it be apparent that other factor must be consider if we be to comprehend fanaticism these be personality factor they include harmony and conflict within the whole man and mechanism whereby inner component be more or less smoothly meet modern psychiatric knowledge provide we with many key to unlock the significance of behavior of the kind the forego factor be pertinent to the analysis of perceptual image and the broad condition under which they achieve realism or fall short of it undoubtedly one merit of the vast panorama of gentile conception of the jew unfold in the present anthology be that it provide a formidable body of material that invite critical examination in term of reality many selection be themselves convince contribution to this appraisal undoubtedly however the significance of the volume be great than the forego paragraph suggest speak a a non-jew i believe that it primary contribution be in the realm of future policy since we can neither undo nor redo the past we be limit to the event of today and tomorrow in this domain the simple fact of coexistence in the same local national and world community be enough to guarantee that we can not refrain from have some effect large or small upon gentile-jewish relation what shall these effect be i be deliberately raise the policy problem involve in gentile-jewish relation comprehensive examination of any policy question call for the performance of the intellectual task inseparable from any problem-solving method the task be briefly indicate by these question what be i goal in gentile-jewish relation what be the historical trend in this country and abroad in the extent to which these goal be effectively realize what factor condition the degree of realization at various time and place what be the probable course of future development what policy if adopt and apply in various circumstance will increase the likelihood that future event will coincide with desire event and do so at least cost in term of all human value it be beyond the province of this epilogue to cover policy question of such depth and range the discussion be therefore limit to a suggest procedure for realize at least some of the potential importance of this volume for future policy a a groundwork for the proposal i give some attention to the first task enumerate above the clarification of goal i reply be that i associate myself with all those who affirm that gentile-jewish relation should contribute to the theory and practice of human dignity the basic goal find partial expression in the universal declaration of human right a statement initiate and endorse by individual and organization of many religious and philosophical tradition within this frame of reference policy appropriate to claim advance in the name of the jew depend upon which jewish identity be involve a well a upon the nature of the claim the characteristic of the claimant the justification propose and the predisposition of the community decision maker who be call upon to act if jew be identify a a religious body in a controversy that come before a national or international tribunal it be obviously compatible with the goal of human dignity to protect freedom of worship when decision maker act within this frame they determine whether a claim put forward in the name of religion be to be accept by the large community a appropriate to religion since the recognition of israel a a nation state claim be make in many case which identify the claimant a a member of the new body politic community decision maker must make up they mind whether a claim be acceptable to the large community in term of prevail expectation regard member of nation state in free country many controversy involve self-styled jew who use the symbol in assert a vaguely cultural rather than religious or political identity the decision maker who act for the community a a whole must decide whether the objective pursue and the method use be appropriate to public policy regard cultural group we know that much be make of the multiplicity and ambiguity of the identity that cluster around the key symbol of the jew many public and private controversy will undoubtedly continue to reflect these confusion in the mind and usage of gentile and jew however in the context of legal and civic policy these controversy be less than novel they involve similar uncertainty regard the multiple identity of any number of non-jewish group so far a the exist body of formal principle and procedure be concern categorical novelty be not to be anticipate in jewish-gentile relationship claim be properly dispose of accord to norm common to all party it be not imply that formal principle and procedure be so firmly entrench within the public order of the world community or even of free commonwealth that they will control in all circumstance involve jew and gentile during come year social process be always anchored in past predisposition but it be perennially restructure in situation where anchor be drag or lose in conformance with the maximization principle we affirm that gentile-jewish relation will be harmonious or inharmonious to the degree that one relation or the other be expect by the active participant to yield the great net advantage take all value outcome and effect into consideration it be not difficult to anticipate circumstance in which negative tension will cumulate for instance imagine the situation if israel ever join an enemy coalition the formal position of american who identify themselves with one or more of the several identity of the jewish symbol be already clear the future weight of informal factor can not be so easily assess when we consider the disorganize state of the world community and the legacy of predisposition adversely direct against all who be identify a jew it be obvious that the struggle for the mind and muscle of man need to be prosecute with increase vigor and skill during moment of intense crisis the responsibility of political leader be overwhelming but they freedom of policy be limit by the pattern of predisposition with which they and the people around they enter the crisis at such critical moment predisposition favorable to human dignity most obviously pay off by the same test predisposition destructive of human personality exercise they most sinister impact with the result that man of good will be often trap and nullify among measure in anticipation of crisis be plan to inject into the turmoil a assistant of key decision maker qualify person who be cognizant of the corrosive effect of crisis upon personal relationship and be also able to raise calm and realistic voice when overburden leader near the limit of self-control we be learn how to do these thing in some of the vast organize structure of modern society the process can be accelerate a truism be that the time to prepare for the bad be when time be good during intercrisis period the educational facility of the community have the possibility of remolding the perspective and alter the behavior of vast number of human being of every age and condition a more man and woman be make capable of live up to the challenge of decency the chance be improve that the pattern of predisposition prevail in position of strength in future crisis can be favorably affect now an abide difficulty of paragraph like the forego be that they appear to preach and in contemporary society we often complain of too much reaffirmation of the goodness of the good in any case i do not intend to let the present occasion pass without deal more directly with the problem of implement good intention i assume that the number of reader of this anthology who regard themselves a morally perfect be small and that most reader be will to consider procedure by which they may gain more insight into themselves and good understand of other properly use the present book be an excellent instrument of enlightenment let we not confuse the issue by label the objective or the method psychoanalytic for this be a well establish term of art for the specific idea and procedure initiate by sigmund freud and he follower for the study and treatment of disorder personality the traditional method proceed by the technique of free association punctuate by interpretation propose by the psychoanalytic interviewer what we have in mind do have something in common with the goal of psychoanalysis and with the method by which they be seek for what we propose however a psychoanalyst be not necessary even though one aim be to enable the reader to get beneath he own defense he defense of himself to himself for this purpose a degree of intellectual and emotional involvement be necessary but involvement need to be accompany by a special frame of mind the relatively long and often colorful selection in this anthology enable the reader to become genuinely absorb in what be say whether he respond with anger or applause but simple involvement be not enough self-discovery call for an open permissive inquire posture of self-observation the symposium provide an opportunity to confront the self with specific statement which be make at particular time by identifiable communicator who be address definite audience and throughout several hundred page everyone be talk about the same key symbol of identification an advantage of be expose to such specificity about an important and recur feature of social reality be that it can be take advantage of by the reader to examine covert a well a overt resonance within himself resonance trigger by explicit symbol cluster around the central figure of the jew
