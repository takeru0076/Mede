thick and small boy keep scamper out on the play field to make fun of the visitor whose pitcher be a formidable look young man with the only baseball cap this be a bitterly fight game carry almost a much grudge a a fist fight with no friendliness exhibit between the team except the formal politeness that accompany the set forth of ground rule and agreement on ball that go into the crowd every pitch in the game bring forth a howl from the enrapture audience and every fly ball the visitor drop and because they right fielder be still a little fuzzy from drink they drop many call forth yelp of derision at one point in the game when the skinny old man in suspenders who be act a umpire get in the way of a throw ball and take it painfully in the kidney he lie there unattended while player and spectator wrangle over whether the ball be dead or the base runner be free to score this be typical of such game which be earnestly play to win and practically never wind up in an expression of good fellowship when the visitor after lose this game ride along the village street toward home the youngster who could keep abreast of they for a moment or two scream triumphantly you bunch of hay-shakers gahn back home you hay-shakers baseball be surely the national game in those day even though professional baseball may have be merely a business radio broadcast have not begin and most devotee of

six baseball team sponsor by grocer and hardware merchant or department store that play two or three time a week throughout the summer usually in the cool of the even before an earnest and partisan audience who do not begrudge a quarter each or even more to be drop into a hat when the game be half over babe ruth of course be everyone s hero and everyone know he even though relatively few ever see he play ball he face be always in the newspaper sometimes in cartoon that seem nearly a large a life a the twenties grow old and a radio broadcast of baseball game begin to involve more and more people daily in the doing of the professional the great hitter always lead by babe ruth overshadow the game so that pitcher be nearly of no account boy no long bother learn to bunt and even school kid scorn to choke up on a bat a willie keeler and the famous hitter of another day have do other hitter bloom with more or less vigor in the news and a few even dare to dream of match ruth who be still call jidge by all he friend or leo or two-head by those who dare to taunt he leo be the name of the ball player he like the least and who call most of the world kid lou gehrig be give the nickname bust and he run ruth a close race in home run but the nickname never stick and gehrig be no match for ruth in color which be sometimes a polite word for delinquent behavior on and off the field ruth be a delinquent boy still but he be in every way a great ball player who be out to win the game and occasionally risk a crack bone to do it a few professional baseball player cultivate eccentricity with the encouragement of the press so that they might see they name in big black print along with daddy brown s al capone s earl sande s and the prince of wale one who for a time succeed good and be still the sorry of all be charles arthur shire who call himself in the newspaper art the great or the great shire it be he brag that he could beat everybody at anything but especially at fight and he

knuckle in art s pocket once when he have occasion to collar the great first baseman for some forget reason this make a sportswriter name pegler wonder in print if art have wear this armament when he defeat he manager the sorry fact about this young man who be barely of age when he break into major-league baseball be that he really be a good ball player than he be give credit for be never so good a he claim and always an irritant to he associate but a good steady performer when he could fight down the temptation to orate on he skill or cut up in public in he minor way charles arthur shire be perhaps more typical of he era than ruth be for he be but one of many young man who lay waste they talent in these scott fitzgerald day for the sake of earn space in the newspaper there be other who climb flagpole and refuse to come down or who ingest strange object like live fish or who undertake to set record for remain erect on a dance floor with or without a partner or who essay to down full bottle of illicit gin without pause for breath one young man exhilarated to the point of insanity by liquor and the excitement of the moment perform a perfect swan dive out of the stand at the yale bowl during the yale-army football game land squarely on he head on the concrete ramp below and die at once but the twenties be not all insanity and a strive after recognition the business of baseball begin to prosper along with other entertainment and performer thank partly to george herman ruth s spectacular effort each season to run he salary high and high prosper too while fifty year before albert goodwill spalding secretary of the chicago ball club of the national league could write earnestly to the manager of the buffalo club and request a guarantee of one hundred dollar for a baseball game in august in this golden era a game at the yankee stadium might bring in nearly a hundred thousand dollar at the gate and while less than ten year early the wayward black sox all of they top performer in they position have toil for stingy charles comiskey at salary range from twenty-five hundred dollar to forty-five hundred dollar a year star now be ask ten thousand dollar twenty thousand

dugan and hoyt and shortstop everett scott by 1926 when the mighty yank be at they mighty only a few of these be leave but they still shine bright even beside able and agile rooky like tony lazzeri who manage never to have one of he epileptic fit on the field mark koenig lou gehrig george pipgras and gray-thatched earl comb the deed of this team through two season and in the two world s series that follow have be write and talk about until hardly a word be leave to be say but there be one small episode that a few new york fan who happen to sit in the cheap seat for one world s series game in 1926 like good to recall babe ruth a he always do in the stadium play right field to avoid have the sun in he eye and tommy thevenow a rather mediocre hitter who play shortstop for the st louis cardinal knock a ball with all he might into the sharp angle form by the permanent stand and the wooden bleacher where ruth could not reach it the ball lie there shine white on the grass in view of nearly every fan in the park while ruth red-necked with frustration charge about the small patch of ground scream where s the -ing ball but a he snarl unhappily when the inning be over not a sonofabitch in the place would tell i so little tommy run all the way home the ordinary man and woman however see little of the great professional game of those golden day or of any other sport event
