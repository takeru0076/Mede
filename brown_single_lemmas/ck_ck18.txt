dance step to a hum tune that you could hardly notice and try to pick up strange man but each time i be ready to say to hell with it and walk out she d pull herself together and talk so understandingly in that sweet husky voice about the good time and the happiness we d have together and there i be back on the hook i do have the decency to call up thelma and tell she i d meet old

buy himself a drink if he go out with we in the even he d leave it on the table untouched when i be in liquor i ride he pretty hard i guess occasionally if i push he too far he d give i a look out of narrow eye and the hard cruel bony skull would show through that smooth face of he some day i tell eileen that guy will kill we both she just would nt listen get drink every night be the only way i could handle the situation eileen seem to feel the same way we still have that much in common the trouble be drink cost money the way eileen and i be hit it up we need ten or fifteen dollar an even
