the virgin island guam american samoa the trust territory and the canal zone jackson miss what do 1961 offer in political and governmental development in mississippi even for those who have be observe the political scene a long time no script from the past be worth very much in gaze into the state s immediate political future this be largely because of the unpredictability of the man who operate the helm of the state government and be the elect leader of it two million inhabitant gov ross barnett barnett who come into office with no previous experience in public administration have surround himself with confusion which not only keep he foe guess but he friend a well consequently it be uncertain after nearly 12 month in office just which direction the barnett administration will take in the come year could be scramble some predict the administration will settle down during 1961 and iron out the rough edge which it have have thus far the builtin headache of the barnett regime thus far have be the steady stream of job-seeker and other who feel they be give commitment by barnett at some stage of he eight-year quest for the governor s office there be many who predict that should barnett decide to call the legislature back into special session it will really throw he administration into a scramble certainly nobody will predict that the next time the lawmaker come back together barnett will be able to enjoy a re-enactment of the strange but successful honeymoon he have in the 1960 legislative session if barnett do nt call a special session in 1961 it will be the first year in the last decade that the legislature have not meet in regular or special session the odds favor a special session more than likely early in the year district issue legislator always get restless for a special session whether for the companionship or the $ 2250 per diem be not certain and if they start agitate barnett be not expect to be able to withstand the pressure the issue which may make it necessary to have a session be the highly sensitive problem of cut the state s congressional district from six to five to eliminate one congressional seat with eye focus on the third congressional district the historic delta district and congressman frank e smith a the one most likely to go the redistricting battle will put to a test the longstanding power which lawmaker from the delta have hold in the legislature mississippi s relation with the national democratic party will be at a crossroads during 1961 with the first democratic president in eight year in the white house split badly during the recent presidential election into almost equally divide camp of party loyalist and member the democratic party in mississippi be currently a wreck and there have be no effort since the election to pull it back together future cloud barnett a the titular head of the democratic party apparently must make the move to reestablish relation with the national democratic party or see a movement come from the loyalist rank to completely bypass he a a party functionary with a democratic administration party patronage would normally begin to flow to mississippi if it have hold it democratic solidarity in the november election now the picture be cloud and even we sen jame o eastland and john c stennis who remain loyal to the ticket be uncertain of they status report be that it be more than probable that the four congressman from mississippi who do not support the party ticket will be strip of the usual patronage which flow to congressman baton rouge la the gov jimmie h davis administration appear to face a difficult year in 1961 with the governor s theme of peace and harmony subject to severe stress the year will probably start out with segregation still the most troublesome issue but it might give way shortly to another vex issue that of finance in state government the transition from segregation to finance might already be in progress in the form of an administration proposal to hike the state sales tax from 2 per cent to 3 per cent the administration have say the sales tax proposal be merely part of the segregation strategy since the revenue from the increase would be dedicate to a grant in aid program but the tardiness of the administration in make the dedication have cause legislator to suspect the tax bill be relate more directly to an over-all shortage of cash than to segregation legislator weary indeed the administration s curious position on the sales tax be a major factor in contribute to it defeat the administration could not say why $ 28 million be need for a grant-in-aid program the effectiveness of the governor in clear up some of the inconsistency revolve about the sales tax bill may play a part in determine whether it can muster the require two-third vote the tax bill will be up for reconsideration wednesday in the house when the legislature reconvene davis may use the tax bill a a mean to effect a transition from special session of the legislature to normalcy if it fail to pass he can throw up he hand and say the legislature would not support he in he effort to prevent integration he could terminate special session of the legislature actually davis would have to toss in the towel soon anyway many legislator be already weary and frustrate over the so-far lose battle to block token integration this be not the sort of thing most politico would care to acknowledge publicly they would like to convey the notion something be be do even though it be something they know to be ineffectual underlie concern passage of the sales tax measure would also give davis the mean to effect a transition he could tell the legislature they have provide the need fund to carry on the battle then he could tell they to go home while the administration continue to wage the battle with the $ 28 million in extra revenue the sales tax measure would bring in over an eight month period it be difficult to be certain how the administration view that $ 28 million since the view of one leader may not be the same a the view of another one but if the administration should find it do not need the $ 28 million for a grant-in-aid program a not unlikely conclusion it could very well seek a way to use the money for other purpose this would be in perfect consonance with the underlie concern in the administration the shortage of cash it could become an acute problem in the come fiscal year if the administration do not succeed in pass the sales tax bill or any other tax bill it could very well be face this spring at the fiscal session of the legislature with an interest dilemma since the constitution forbid introduction of a tax bill at a fiscal session the administration will either have to cut down expense or inflate it estimate of anticipate revenue constant problem in either case it could call a special session of the legislature late in 1961 to make another stab at raise additional revenue through a tax raiser the prospect of cut back spend be an unpleasant one for any governor it be one that most try to avoid a long a they can see an alternative approach to the problem but if all alternative should be clearly block off it can be expect the davis administration will take step to trim spend at the spring session of the state legislature this might be do to arouse those who have be squeeze out by the trim to exert pressure on the legislature so it would be more receptive to a tax proposal late in the year a constant problem confront davis on any proposal for new tax will be the charge by he foe that he have not try to economize any tax bill also will revive allegation that some of he follower have be use they administration affiliation imprudently to profit themselves the new year might see some house-cleaning either genuine or token depend upon development to give davis an opportunity to combat some of these criticism
