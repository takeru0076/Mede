energy in provide for these inner individual function religion undertake in behalf of individual peace of mind and well-being service for which there be no other institution in addition to the function of religion within man there have always be the outer social function for the community and society the two have never be separable religion be vitally necessary in both societal maintenance and regulation the value-system of a community or society be always correlate with and to a degree dependent upon a more or less share system of religious belief and conviction the religion support re-enforce reaffirm and maintain the fundamental value even in the unite state with it freedom of religious belief and worship and it vast denominational differentiation there be a general consensus regard the basic christian value this be demonstrate especially when there be awareness of radically different value orientation elsewhere for example american rally to christian value vis-a-vis those of atheistic communism in america also all of we major religious body officially sanction a universalistic ethic which be reflective of we common religion even the non-church member the freewheelers marginal religionists and so on have the value of christian civilization internalize in they furthermore religion tend to integrate the whole range of value from the high or ultimate value of god to the intermediary and subordinate value for example those regard material object and pragmatic end finally it give sanctity more than human legitimacy and even through super-empirical reference transcendent and supernatural importance to some value for example marriage a a sacrament much law-breaking a sinful occasionally the state a a divine instrument it place certain value at least beyond question and tamper closely relate to this function be the fact that the religious system provide a body of ultimate end for the society which be compatible with the supreme eternal end this something lead to a conception of an over-all social plan with a mean interpretable in term of ultimate end for example a plan that fulfill the will of god which advance the kingdom of god which involve social life a part of the grand design this explain some group end and provide a justification of they primacy it give social guidance and direction and make for program of social action finally it give mean to much social endeavor and logic consistency and mean to life in general there be no society so secularize a to be completely without religiously inspire transcendental end religion integrate and unify some of the old most persistent and most cohesive form of social grouping have grow out of religion these group have vary widely from mere family primitive totemic group and small modern cult and sect to the membership of great denomination and great widely disperse world religion religion foster group life in various way the common ultimate value end and goal foster by religion be a most important factor without a system of value there can be no society where such a value system prevail it always unify all who possess it it enable member of the society to operate a a system the belief of a religion also reflect the value be express in creed dogma and doctrine and form what durkheim call a credo a he point out a religious group can not exist without a collective credo and the more extensive the credo the more unify and strong be the group the credo unify and socialize man by attach they completely to an identical body of doctrine the more extensive and firm the body of doctrine the firm the group the religious symbolism and especially the closely relate rite and worship form constitute a powerful bond for the member of the particular faith the religion in fact be an expression of the unity of the group small or large the common code for religious action a such and in they ethical aspect for everyday moral behavior bind the devotee together these be way of jointly participate in significantly symbolize standardize and order religiously sanctify behavior the code be mechanism for train in and direct and enforce uniform social interaction and for continually and publicly reassert the solidarity of the group durkheim note long ago that religion a a unify system of belief and practice relative to sacred thing unite into one single moral community all those who adhere to they he view be that every religion pertain to a community and conversely every community be in one aspect a religious unit this be bring out in the common religious ethos that prevail even in the denominationally diverse audience at many secular semi-public and public occasion in the unite state and it be evidence in the prayer offer in the frequent religious allusion and in the confirmation of point on religious ground the unify effect of religion be also bring out in the fact that historically people have cling together a more or less cohesive cultural unit with religion a the dominant bond even though spatially disperse and not politically organize the jew for 2500 year have be a prime example though the adherent of any world or interpeople religion be case in point it might be point out that the integrate function of religion for good or ill have often support or be identify with other grouping political nationality language class racial sociability even economic religion usually exercise a stabilizing-conserving function a such it act a an anchor for the people there be a mark tendency for religion once firmly establish to resist change not only in they own doctrine and policy and practice but also in secular affair have religious relevance it have thus be a significant factor in the conservation of social value though also in some measure an obstacle to the creation or diffusion of new one it tend to support the longstanding precious sentiment the traditional way of think and the customary way of live a yinger have point out the reliance on symbol on tradition on sacred writing on the cultivation of emotional feeling of identity and harmony with sacred value turn one to the past far more than to the future historically religion have also function a a tremendous engine of vindication enforcement sanction and perpetuation of various other institution at the same time that religion exercise a conserve influence it also energize and motivate both individual and group much of the important individual and social action have be owe to religious incentive the great ultimate end of religion have serve a magnificent beacon light that lure people toward they with an almost irresistible force mobilize energy and induce sacrifice for example the crusade mission effort just war much effort have be expend in the sincere effort to apply the teach and admonition of religion the insuperable reward system that most religion embody have great motivate effect religion provide the most attractive reward either in this world or the next for those who not merely abide by it norm but who engage in good work religion usually act a a powerful aid in social control enforce what man should or should not do among primitive people the sanction and dictate of religion be more bind than any of the other control exercise by the group and in modern society such influence be still great religion have it own supernatural prescription that be at the same time code of behavior for the here and now
