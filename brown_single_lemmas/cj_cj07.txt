the poynting-robertson effect robertson 1937 wyatt and whipple 1950 which be a retardation of the orbital motion of particle by the relativistic aberration of the repulsive force of the impinging solar radiation cause the dust to spiral into the sun in time much short than the age of the earth the radial velocity vary inversely a the particle size a 1000-m-diameter particle near the orbit of mar would reach the sun in about 60 million year whipple 1955 extend the effect to include the solar-corpuscular-radiation pressure which increase both the minimum particle size and the drag far the corpuscular radiation ie the solar-wind proton must sputter away the surface atom of the dust and cause a slow diminution in size with a resultant increase in both the poynting-robertson effect and the ratio of the repulsive force to the gravitational force the poynting-robertson effect cause the semi-major axis of orbit to diminish more rapidly than the semi-minor axis with a consequent tendency toward circular orbit a the particle move toward the sun also planetary gravitational attraction increase the dust concentration near the plane of the ecliptic a the sun be approach at one astronomical unit from the sun the earth s distance the dust orbit be probably nearly circular if such be the case the particle within a distance of about afj of the earth will have relative to the earth a kinetic energy less than they potential energy and they will be capture into orbit about the earth de jager 1955 have calculate the time require for these particle to reach the atmosphere under the influence of the poynting-robertson effect which in this case cause the orbit to become more and more eccentric without change the semi-major axis this effect can give rise to a blanket of micrometeorite around the earth since there be a continual loss of micrometeoritic material in space because of the radiation effect there must be a continual replenishment otherwise micrometeorite would have disappear from interplanetary space there be several possible source accord to whipple 1955 cometary debris be sufficient to replenish the material spirale into the sun maintain a fairly steady state asteroidal collision be also think to contribute material it be also possible that some of the dust in the vicinity of the earth originate from meteoritic impact upon the moon 53 direct measurement of micrometeorite flux one can not make a very satisfactory guess about the micrometeorite flux in space even in the neighborhood of the earth where information have be obtain both directly and indirectly the derive flux value vary by at least four order of magnitude this large discrepancy demonstrate the inadequacy of the experimental method and the lack of understand of the various phenomenon involve beyond a few million kilometer from the earth but still in the region of the earth s orbit a prediction of the flux of dust be even more unreliable at great distance from the sun the situation be still less certain there be several source of evidence on the micrometeorite environment direct information have be obtain from rocket and satellite equip with impact sensor in addition the size distribution obtain from visual and radar observation of meteor may be extrapolate to the micrometeorite domain from the brightness of the f component of the solar corona and the brightness of the zodiacal light an estimate of the particle size concentration and spatial distribution can be derive for region of space near the ecliptic plane another important source of evidence only recently receive much attention be the analysis of atmospheric dust for a meteoritic component the core of deep-sea sediment and content of collector in remote region be valuable in this category the data provide a measure of the total mass of cosmic material incident upon the earth the direct evidence on the micrometeorite environment near the earth be obtain from piezoelectric sensor essentially microphone and from wire gage these instrument be install on rocket satellite and space probe statistically the most significant data have be collect from the sensor on 1958 alpha explorer 1 1958 delta 2 sputnik 3 and 1959 eta vanguard 3 these vehicle with large sensitive area have collect data for long enough time to give reliable impact rate for the period of exposure many other vehicle with small sensitive-area exposure-time product contribute some information the impact rate on 1958 alpha for 153 event be afj for particle of mass great than afj dubin 1960 this mass threshold be derive from the detector calibration and an assume impact velocity of afj the data show daily and diurnal variation ninety per cent of the 153 record impact occur between midnight and noon and from day to day the variation of the rate be a much a an order of magnitude one may conclude that most of the detect micrometeoritic material be concentrate in orbital stream which intersect the earth s orbit there have be contradictory report from 1958 delta 2 and the data quote here be believe to be the more reliable on may 15 a very large increase occur with afj of mass between afj and afj for the next two day the impact rate be afj and for the next nine day the impact rate be less than afj nazarova 1960 the data for the first day indicate a meteor stream with a very high concentration of particle and may have lead to the high estimate of micrometeorite flux preliminary data from 1959 eta give an average impact rate of afj for mass large than afj for about 1000 event in a 22-day period lagow and alexander 1960 the day-to-day rate vary by less than a factor of 45 the data have not yet be analyze for diurnal variation note that the mass threshold be four time that of 1958 alpha and that the flux be one fifth a large if one assume that the average flux do not change between measurement a mass-distribution curve be obtain which relate the flux of particle large than a give radius to the inverse 72 power of the radius space probe have yield little information pioneer 1 record a decrease in flux with distance from the earth on the basis of 11 count in 9 hour with detector sensitive to three mass interval and base on a few count the second and third russian space probe indicate that the flux of the small particle detect be less than that of large one be base on so few event these result be of dubious validity the calibration of piezoelectric sensor in term of the particle parameter be very uncertain many worker believe that the response be proportional to the incident momentum of the particle a relation deduce from laboratory result linearly extrapolate to meteoritic velocity however one must expect that vaporization and ejection of material by hypervelocity impact would cause a deviation from a linear relationship in the unite state most of the sensor be calibrate by drop small sphere on they sensitive surface the russian experimenter claim that only a small fraction of the impulse from the sensor be cause by the incident momentum with the remainder be momentum of eject material from the sensor this ejection momentum be linearly relate to the particle energy they quote about the same mass threshold a that of the we apparatus but a momentum threshold about 40 time great there be a difference in the experimental arrangement in that the we microphone be attach directly to the vehicle skin while the russian instrument be isolate from the skin the threshold mass be derive from the momentum threshold with the assumption of a mean impact velocity of afj in the we work and afj in the ussr work the threshold mass of about afj correspond to a 10-m-diameter sphere of density afj however the conversion from mass to size be unreliable since many photographic meteor give evidence of a fluffy loosely bind meteorite structure with density a low a afj to what extent such low density apply to micrometeorite be unknown the velocity value use be also open to some question if a substantial fraction of the dust be orbit about the earth only about one third the above-mentioned average velocity should be use in derive the mass zodiacal light and the gegenschein give some evidence for such a dust blanket a phenomenon also to be expect if the dust before capture be in circular orbit about the sun a indicate by the trend of the small visible meteor the diurnal variation in the observe flux may be partly due to the dependence of the detector sensitivity on the incident velocity the flux of micrometeorite in the neighborhood of the earth can be estimate by extrapolation from radar and visual meteor data a summary of meteorite data prepare by whipple 1958 on the basis of photographic visual and radar evidence be give in table 5-1 from an estimate mass of 25 g for a zero-magnitude meteorite the other mass be derive with the assumption of a mass decrease by a factor of 2512 for each unit increase in magnitude the radius be calculate from the mass by assume sphere of density afj except for the small particle which must have a high mass density to remain in the solar system in the presence of solar-radiation pressure the flux value be for all particle with mass great than the give mass and be base on an estimate of the number of visual meteor it be assume that the flux value increase by a factor of 2512 per magnitude in accordance with the opinion that the total mass flux in each unit range in magnitude be constant the value agree with the data from 1958 alpha and 1959 eta the figure in the next-to-last column be derive with the assumption of 50 per cent shield by the earth hence these figure apply immediately above the earth s atmosphere the unshielded flux be give in the last column these figure constitute the good estimate for the flux in interplanetary space near the earth of course if there be a dust blanket around the earth the flux in interplanetary space should be less than the figure give here note that the mass scale be one to two order of magnitude great than some previously use for example jacchia 1948 derive a scale of 015 g for a afj zero-magnitude meteorite the old scale be base on theoretical estimate of the conversion efficiency of kinetic energy into light the mass scale use in table 5-1 be derive on the assumption that the motion of the glow trail be relate to the momentum transfer to the trail by the meteorite permit the calculation of the mass if the velocity be know cook and whipple 1958 a concentration distribution have be derive from radar observation sensitive to the fifteenth magnitude man and eshleman 1959 extrapolation of this relationship through the thirtieth magnitude cover the range of micrometeorite the approximate equation be afj where n be the number of afj with electron line-density great than or equal to afj and q be proportional to the mass of the meteorite therefore n be inversely proportional to the radius cube and in fair agreement with the inverse 72 power derive from 1958 alpha and 1959 eta data at the fifteenth magnitude afj and at the twenty-fifth magnitude afj these extrapolate flux be about an order of magnitude less than the value from the satellite data and the figure in whipple s table the extrapolation may be in error for several reason the observational data determine the concentration distribution have a range of error which be magnify in the extension into the micrometeorite region the solar-electromagnetic - and corpuscular-radiation pressure and the associate poynting-robertson effect increase in effectiveness a the particle size decrease and modify the distribution and limit size to large than a few micron also it have be suggest that the source of all or part of the dust may not be the same a that for visual or radar meteorite good 1960 and the same distribution would not be expect 54 indirect indication of micrometeorite flux a measure of the total mass accretion of meteoritic material by the earth be obtain from analysis of deep-sea sediment and dust collect in remote region pettersson 1960 most meteoritic material by the time it reach the earth s surface have be reduce to dust or to spherules of ablate material in it passage through the atmosphere for all meteorite the average nickel content be about 25 per cent this be much high than the nickel content of terrestrial dust and sediment and provide a basis for the determination of the meteoritic mass influx present data indicate an accretion of about afj ton per year over the entire globe or about afj
