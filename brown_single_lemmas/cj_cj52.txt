but neither be the statement empirical for goodness be not a quality like red or squeaky that could be see or hear what be they to do then with these awkward judgment of value to find a place for they in they theory of knowledge would require they to revise the theory radically and yet that theory be what they regard a they most important discovery it appear that the theory could be save in one way only if it could be show that judgment of good and bad be not judgment at all that they assert nothing true or false but merely express emotion like hurrah or fiddlesticks then these wayward judgment would cease from trouble and weary head could be at rest this be the course the positivist take they explain value judgment by explain they away now i do not think they view will do but before discuss it i should like to record one vote of thank to they for the clarity with which they have state they case it have be say of john stuart mill that he write so clearly that he could be find out this theory have be put so clearly and precisely that it deserve criticism of the same kind and this i will do i good to supply the theory claim to show by analysis that when we say that be good we do not mean to assert a character of the subject of which we be think i shall argue that we do mean to do just that let we work through an example and the simple and commone the good there be perhaps no value statement on which people would more universally agree than the statement that intense pain be bad let we take a set of circumstance in which i happen to be interest on the legislative side and in which i think every one of we might naturally make such a statement we come upon a rabbit that have be catch in one of the brutal trap in common use there be sign that it have struggle for day to escape and that in a frenzy of hunger pain and fear it have all but eat off it own leg the attempt fail the animal be now dead a we think of the long and excruciating pain it must have suffer we be very likely to say it be a bad thing that the little animal should suffer so the positivist tell we that when we say this we be only express we present emotion i hold on the contrary that we mean to assert something of the pain itself namely that it be bad bad when and a it occur consider what follow from the positivist view on that view nothing good or bad happen in the case until i come on the scene and make i remark for what i express in i remark be something go on in i at the time and that of course do not exist until i do come on the scene the pain of the rabbit be not itself bad nothing evil be happen when that pain be be endure badness in the only sense in which it be involve at all wait for it appearance till i come and look and feel now that this be at odds with we mean may be show a follow let we put to ourselves the hypothesis that we have not come on the scene and that the rabbit never be discover be we prepare to say that in that case nothing bad occur in the sense in which we say it do clearly not indeed we should say on the contrary that the accident of we late discovery make no difference whatever to the badness of the animal s pain that it would have be every whit a bad whether a chance passer-by happen late to discover the body and feel repugnance or not if so then it be clear that in say the suffer be bad we be not express we feeling only we be say that the pain be bad when and a it occur and before anyone take an attitude toward it the first argument be thus an ideal experiment in which we use the method of difference it remove we present expression and show that the badness we mean would not be affect by this whereas on positivist ground it should be the second argument apply the method in the reverse way it ideally remove the past event and show that this would render false what we mean to say whereas on positivist ground it should not let we suppose that the animal do not in fact fall into the trap and do not suffer at all but that we mistakenly believe it do and say a before that it suffer be an evil thing on the positivist theory everything i seek to express by call it evil in the first case be still present in the second in the only sense in which badness be involve at all whatever be bad in the first case be still present in it entirety since all that be express in either case be a state of feel and that feel be still there and we question be be such an implication consistent with what we mean clearly it be not if anyone ask we after we make the remark that the suffer be a bad thing whether we should think it relevant to what we say to learn that the incident have never occur and no pain have be suffer at all we should say that it make all the difference in the world that what we be assert to be bad be precisely the suffer we think have occur back there that if this have not occur there be nothing leave to be bad and that we assertion be in that case mistake the suggestion that in say something evil have occur we be after all make no mistake because we have never mean anyhow to say anything about the past suffer seem to i merely frivolous if we do not mean to say this why should we be so relieve on find that the suffer have not occur on the theory before we such relief would be groundless for in that suffer itself there be nothing bad at all and hence in it nonoccurrence there would be nothing to be relieve about the positivist theory would here distort we mean beyond recognition so far a i can see there be only one way out for the positivist he hold that goodness and badness lie in feeling of approval or disapproval and there be a way in which he might hold that badness do in this case precede we own feel of disapproval without belong to the pain itself the pain in itself be neutral but unfortunately the rabbit on no ground at all take up toward this neutral object an attitude of disapproval and that make it for the first time and in the only intelligible sense bad this way of escape be theoretically possible but since it have grave difficulty of it own and have not so far a i know be urge by positivist it be perhaps good not to spend time over it i come now to a third argument which again be very simple when we come upon the rabbit and make we remark about it suffer be a bad thing we presumably make it with some feel the positivist be plainly right in say that such remark do usually express feel but suppose that a week late we revert to the incident in think and make we statement again and suppose that the circumstance have now so change that the feel with which we make the remark in the first place have fade the pathetic evidence be no long before we and we be now so fatigue in body and mind that feel be a we say quite dead in these circumstance since what be express by the remark when first make be on the theory before we simply absent the remark now express nothing it be a empty a the word hurrah would be when there be no enthusiasm behind it and this seem to i untrue when we repeat the remark that such suffer be a bad thing the feel with which we make it last week may be at or near the vanish point but if we be ask whether we mean to say what we do before we should certainly answer yes we should say that we make we point with feel the first time and little or no feel the second time but that it be the same point we be make and if we can see that what we mean to say remain the same while the feel vary from intensity to near zero it be not the feel that we primarily mean to express i come now to a fourth consideration we all believe that toward act or effect of a certain kind one attitude be fit and another not but on the theory before we such a belief would not make sense broad and ross have lately contend that this fitness be one of the main fact of ethics and i suspect they be right but that be not exactly i point i point be this whether there be such fitness or not we all assume that there be and if we do we express in moral judgment more than the subjectivist say we do let i illustrate in he novel the house of the dead dostoevsky tell of he experience in a siberian prison camp whatever the unhappy inmate of such camp be like today dostoevsky s companion be about a grim a lot a can be imagine i have hear story he write of the most terrible the most unnatural action of the most monstrous murder tell with the most spontaneous childishly merry laughter most of we would say that in this delight at the kill of other or the cause of suffer there be something very unfitting if we be ask why we think so we should say that these thing involve great evil and be wrong and that to take delight in what be evil or wrong be plainly unfitting now on the subjectivist view this answer be rule out for before someone take up an attitude toward death suffer or they infliction they have no moral quality at all there be therefore nothing about they to which an attitude of approval or condemnation could be fit they be in themselves neutral and so far a they get a moral quality they get it only through be invest with it by the attitude of the onlooker but if that be true why be any attitude more fit than any other would applause for example be fit if apart from the applause there be nothing good to applaud would condemnation be fit if independently of the condemnation there be nothing bad to condemn in such a case any attitude would be a fit or unfitting a any other which mean that the notion of fitness have lose all point indeed we be force to go much far if goodness and badness lie in attitude only and hence be bring into be by they those man who greet death and misery with childishly merry laughter be take the only sensible line if there be nothing evil in these thing if they get they moral complexion only from we feel about they why should nt they be greet with a cheer to greet they with repulsion would turn what before be neutral into something bad it would needlessly bring badness into the world and even on subjectivist assumption that do not seem very bright on the other hand to greet they with delight would convert what before be neutral into something good it would bring goodness into the world
