in the period since the end of world war 2 a period coincide with merchandise demand for the colorful the unusual and the original in sign and display plastic have come on so strong that today they be the acknowledge leader in the field the importance of the sign industry to the plastic industry however be not in term of volume alone designer of sign and display have show a refresh approach to the adaptation of plastic that have influence the working of other industry many of today s development in thermoforming stem from original work do with sign and display the art of preprinting in distortion be similarly perfect by the sign maker and the reverse-surface decorate technique now use for escutcheon medallion etc owe much to the field a do the technology of design with the light-transmitting property of the transparent plastic there be much that many industry can continue to learn from some of the more recent development describe below the concept of trans-illumination a show by the photo on p 92 a just one example offer an entirely new approach to light problem no matter what industry be involve a volume market accord to a recent wall street journal survey plastic unit now account for more than 50 % of all sign sales five year ago they have only 10 % of the market with the remainder firmly entrench in the stronghold of neon tubing and it s far from the end for plastic industry source be now estimate that 75 % of the sign make during the 1960 s will be of plastic construction evidence of this trend can good be see in the recent activity of such lead company in the field a advance neon sign co los angeles calif four year ago the company s entire line be devote to neon sign today 85 % be in plastic from the volume standpoint the total market represent by the sign industry be impressive aggregate sales during 1960 reach approximately $ 500 million currently there be some 6000 company in the field range from small firm with a handful of employee to major concern have complete facility for production of metal electrical and plastic component why the trend to plastic what account for the rapid growth of plastic in the sign and display field out of many factor which might be cite five be most important 1 plastic combine such property a built-in color light weight optional transparency or translucency resistance to corrosion a well a the ease of fabrication 2 plastic sign be economical accord to one major producer material for a typical plastic sign be approximately 25 % less costly than for a comparable neon unit ship cost be also reduce a 3-by-6-ft plastic sign weigh about 120 lb compare to 275-300 lb for neon the weight advantage plus great durability of the plastic unit yield a save of about one-fifth in ship the light weight also mean less costly support and mounting be need finally maintenance cost on plastic sign be much low than on fragile neon sign 3 they offer exceptional design freedom make it possible to incorporate contour and detail which give free range to the talent of the designer vacuum - and pressure-formed sheet plastic fill the gap between cardboard and mold plastic pre-decoration low-cost mold and the freedom to form large and small thick and thin material make plastic tailor-made for the industry 4 plastic sign work around the clock internal illumination protect from the element give they powerful visual appeal at night during daylight hour they brilliant color command attention and interest 5 advance in equipment and fabrication technique give the sign or display manufacturer an extremely wide choice of production technique range from injection molding for intricate smaller-size mass-production sign generally 5000 unit be the minimum to vacuum and pressure form for large sign of limit run among the new fabrication method to enter the display field be expandable styrene molding and blow molding what plastic to use for outdoor sign and display acrylic with it outstanding optical characteristic weather resistance and formability strongly dominate the picture at present both the familiar cast acrylic and the new extrude sheet be be use by sign manufacturer with extrude now represent an estimate 10 % of the total see panel p 166 for a comparison of interest be a recent announcement by do pont s polychemicals dept of a new methyl methacrylate monomer designate a monocite h 100 which be develop specifically for production of cast acrylic sheet for the sign and light industry sheet cast from this material reportedly weigh only one-third a much a glass be impervious to all kind of weather and will not yellow it high impact strength even at low temperature resist chip crack and craze accord to do pont cellulose acetate butyrate be use extensively for vacuum-formed sign background panel and mold or form letter because of it exceptional toughness ease of form and excellent weather property it clarity and good optical property be other important factor new to the field be a duplex type butyrate laminate in which the two sheet of the laminate be of different color thermoforming the laminate and then sand away the top layer be a quick and economical way to produce a two-color sign see mpl mar 1961 p 98 for specialize type of display such a large three-dimensional unit reproduce a product package human or animal figure etc reinforce plastic and rotationally mold vinyl plastisols be other material frequently use a relative newcomer in outdoor sign be mylar polyester film now use a a print overlay for trans-illuminated sign see below for outdoor sign and display where the problem of weather resistance be no long a factor the choice of plastic be almost unlimited here may be find regular and impact styrene cellulose acetate cellulose butyrate and cellulose propionate acrylic vinyl expandable styrene foam and polyethylene the final choice of material depend upon such factor a cost method of fabrication degree of complexity number of unit require time available for tool and project life expectancy of the unit often the finish sign or display incorporate several type of plastic and two or more fabricate technique trans-illuminated billboard one of the most significant advancement in design of plastic sign be the so-called trans-illuminated billboard now be produce by several large sign manufacturer such a advance neon sign co los angeles and industrial electric inc new orleans la the essential difference between the new trans-illuminated board and exist billboard be that the former construct of translucent plastic panel be light from within with the source of light behind the copy there be no loss of lumen output a with conventional board illuminate by mean of reflect light also the light source be shield from dirt and weather exposure and can not obstruct the view of the sign the copy itself include any text or illustration be reproduce in full color directly on a thin mylar polyester film by a photo screen process the film have an adhesive on the back which permit it to be strip onto the acrylic panel form the sign and also to be strip off for replacement by new copy a require spare set of face panel simplify the change from one copy or message to another new panel be exchange for the old right in the field on a single trip panel with outdated copy be return to the sign shop so a new message can be apply sign of this type have already make they appearance in several large city and other be on the way it be believe that these board will within the next few year replace many of the conventional flood-lighted board now in use trans-illuminated sign also show versatility in other direction a use by industrial electric inc the film panel be print one at a time a be 24-sheet poster thus the film can be apply to back-lighted translucent plastic face they can also be apply to opaque panel for use on cutout or they can be apply directly to paint bulletin face in this way the sign maker have an economical mean for display uniform copy on different sign media recently industrial electric unveil another new development make possible by modern plastic material a revolve spectacular sign comprise of 16 triangular trans-illuminated plastic section it make it possible to combine three different sign in a single unit the triangle automatically revolve in a cycle which permit 9 sec of view time for each poster subject sixteen panel each slightly more than 1-12 ft wide make up the 25-ft length of the sign changeable letter fill many need perhaps the good way to indicate the versatility of design that characterize the use of plastic in sign and display would be to look at what be happen in only one of the area in this complex field changeable sign sign be mean to convey a message and in most case this require word and letter frequently the message must be change at interval to feature new product price change etc the huge market for changeable sign have spur a universal demand for individual plastic letter in all shape and size and a number of company be set up to supply they here be some of the new item currently available poster product inc chicago ill a changeable copy and display sign which consist of an extrude impact styrene background in choice of color onto which be mount snap-in letter figure or word screen on acetate or other type of sheet stock the background which be available in various width and continuous length be extrude with parallel undercut groove which grip the flexible letter securely the adaptaplex co beaverton ore letter mold of butyrate available in several size in either red or black ideal for merchandise use they be weather-resistant and have mount peg on the back which fit into opening in a vacuum-formed waffle-pattern background panel for large letter eg thermoformed of acrylic or butyrate there be other technique for example in a typical store installation fifty 24-in and six 36-in red acrylic letter be mount against a white paint wood background the fact that even the large letter weigh only 5 lb each make it possible to secure the letter to the build through clear acrylic angle bracket cement to the letter stainless steel screw be use to minimize corrosion stain for mount to corrugated plastic background very small hole may be drill in the side of the letter and stainless steel wire thread through the opening it end twist behind the panel large injection-molded letter be also available for sign installation wagner sign service inc chicago for example supply they in several color in height of 4 6 8 10 and 17 inch they be mold of a special weather-resistant formulation of tenite butyrate also available from this company be snug-grip plasti-bars extrude of transparent acrylic material which may be cement to any corrugated acrylic background material make in length from 3 to 10 ft the bar be shape in cross section to provide a secure fit for the taper slot mold in back of the letter still another approach to the changeable letter type of sign be a modular unit introduce by merritt product azusa calif this vacuum form sign be comprise of 27-in or small panel form of 0080-in clear butyrate sheet stock mask and spray on the rear side finish sign be produce by slide the separate letter panel into channel of 0025-in aluminum which may be mount to various surface the sheet be extrude of tenite butyrate by jet specialty co los angeles calif on large-area unit where additional structural requirement be impose one recent approach utilize modular extrude or form channel eg right-angled corrugation of the acrylic or butyrate join side by side such channel make possible construction of continuous two-dimensional luminous area up to 50 ft high and of unlimited width letter may be wire to the face of the combine channel paint on the first surface or handle in other way
