the controversy of the last few year over whether architect or interior designer should plan the interior of modern building have bring clearly into focus one important difference of opinion the architect do not believe that the education of the interior designer be sufficiently good or sufficiently extend to compare with that of the architect and that therefore the interior designer be incapable of understand the architectural principle involve in plan the interior of a build ordinary politeness may have militate against this opinion be state so badly but anyone with a wide acquaintance in both group and who have sit through the many round table workshop or panel discussion whatever they be call on this subject will recognize that the final boil down crux of the matter be education it be true that most architectural school have five year course some even have six or more the element of public danger which enter so largely into architectural certification however would demand a prolong study of structure this would naturally lengthen they course far beyond the largely esthetic demand of interior designer s train we may then dismiss the time difference between these course and the usual four year course of the interior design student a not have serious bear on the subject the real question that follow be how be those four year use and what be they value a train the american institute of interior designer have publish a recommend course for designer and a percentage layout of such a course an examination of some forty catalog of school offer course in interior design for the most part school accredit by membership in the national association of school of art and a far on the spot inspection of a number of school show they course adhere pretty closely to the recommendation one or two of the school have a five year curriculum but the usual pattern of american education have limit most of they to the four-year plan which seem to be the minimum in acceptable institution the suggest course of the aid be base on the usual course offer and on the opinion of many educator a to curricular necessity obviously the four year provision limit this to fundamental and much desirable material must be eliminate without compare the relative merit of the two course architecture versus interior design let we examine the educational need of the interior designer to begin with what be an interior designer the dictionary of occupational title publish by the we department of labor describe he a follow design plan and furnish interior of house commercial and institutional structure hotel club ship theaters a well a set decoration for motion picture art and television make drawing and plan of room show placement of furniture floor covering wall decoration and determine color scheme furnish complete cost estimate for client approval make necessary purchase place contract supervise construction installation finish and placement of furniture fixture and other correlate furnishing and follow through to completion of project in addition to this the we civil service bureau when examine applicant for government position a interior designer expect that when various need object be not obtainable on the market he will design they he must be capable of design for and supervise the manufacture of any craft material need in the furnishing this seem like a large order the interior designer then must first be an artist but also understand carpentry and painting and light and plumbing and finance yet nobody will question the necessity of all this and any reputable interior designer do know all this and do practice it and far he must understand he obligation to the client to not only meet he physical necessity but also to enhance and improve he life and to enlarge the cultural horizon of we society few will quarrel with the aim of the school or with the word of they curriculum it be in the quality of the teach of all this that a question may arise the old establish independent art school try they good to fulfill they obligation yet even here many a problem be present a in a recent design competition with a floor plan and the simple command design a luxury apartment no description of the client or he cultural level no assertion of geographical area or local social necessity simply a luxury apartment work in a vacuum of minimal information can result only in show piece that look good in exhibition and catalog and may please the public relation department but have little to do with the essence of interior design it be possible of course to work on extant or project building where either architect or owner will explain they necessity so that the student may get the feel of real interior design demand unfortunately the purely synthetic problem be the rule it be like medical school in india where in that fairy-land of religious inhibition the dissection of dead body be frown upon instead they learn they dissection on the bulb of plant thus technical efficiency be achieve at the expense of actual experience in the early year of train certain phase of the work must be cover and the synthetic problem have it use but to continue to divorce advance student from reality be inexcusable consultation with architect client real estate man fabric house and furniture company be essential to the proper development of class problem just a in actual work fortunately although only a few year ago they hold the student at arm length today the business house welcome the opportunity to aid the student not only from an increase sense of community responsibility but also from the realization that the student of today be the interior designer of tomorrow that the student already be in the trade even the history of furniture can hardly be teach exclusively from photograph and lantern slide here too the reality of actual furniture must be experience the professional organization such a american institute of interior designer national society of interior designer home fashion league and various trade association can and do aid greatly in this work certainly every educator involve in interior design should be a member and active in the work of one of these organization not only should every educator above the rank of instructor be expect to be a member of one of the professional organization but he first qualification for membership a an educator should be so sharply scrutinize that membership would be equivalent to certification to teach the subject participation for the educator in this case however would have to be raise to full and complete membership the large of these organization at present deny to the full time educator any vote on the conduct and standard of the group and indeed refuse he even the right to attach the customary initial after he name in the college catalog this anomalous status of the educator can not fail to low he stand in the eye of the student the professor in turn dare not tolerate the influence in he class of an organization in the policy and standard of which he have no voice this seem somewhat shortsighted since if the absolute educational qualification for membership which the organization profess be ever enforce the educator will have the molding of the entire profession in he hand in one way the institute and society do a disservice to the school that be in the continuance of the grandfather clause in they membership requirement when these group be first form many prominent and accomplish decorator could not have have the advantage of school train since interior design course be rare and undeveloped during they youth long hard year of on the job train have bring they to they competence the necessity of that day have long disappear there be plenty of opportunity for proper education today it be discourage for student to realize that the society do not truly uphold the standard for which they be suppose to stand the reason and the day of grandfather clause have long since pass no one can deny that these back door admission to membership provision have be seriously abuse nor that they have not result in the admission of downright incompetent to membership in supposedly learn society beyond any question of curriculum and approach to subject must be the quality of the teacher themselves it will occur to anyone that the teacher must have adequate education a depth and breadth of knowledge far beyond the immediate necessity of he course plus complete dedication to he subject and to he student the local decorator who rush in for a few hour of teach may but more likely may not have these qualification nor will the hack the jack-of-all-trades still find in some of the small art school suffice only a few year ago a middle western college circulate a request for a teacher of interior design at the end of it letter be the information that applicant for this position must also be prepare to teach costume design and advertise art this kind of irresponsibility toward they student can scarcely build a strong professional attitude in the future designer we must build a corps of highly professional teacher of interior design who have have education experience in the profession and be will to take on the usual accompaniment of teach minimal income and minimal status among they confrere considerable specialization in teach subject such a architecture furniture design textile and color be also desirable in all degree course in interior design a number of academic or general study course be include it be only fair to demand that teacher of course in english history psychology and so on be a well inform in matter of art especially interior design a be the art teacher educate in the academic subject the proper correlation of the art with the academic can be achieve only if this standard be observe the matter of sympathy of the academic professor for art objective also must be take into account one technical question of school organization come to mind here for proper accreditation of school teacher in any course must have a degree at least one level above that for which the student be a candidate since there be almost no school in the country offer graduate work in interior design this rule can not at present be observe indeed it have only be a matter of the last few year that reputable school of art have grant degree at all the question however can not be ignore for long the basic problem involve be that a college set up a graduate school must have an entirely separate faculty for the advance degree most professor in the course must naturally again have a high degree than the course offer one solution be the aquisition of degree in education but it be a poor substitute it be a sort of academic ring-around-a-rosy and you solve it this bring we to the question of accreditation of art school in general only the independent art school that be those not connect with any university or college receive severe and separate investigation before accreditation by the various regional organization it have be the custom for most university to stretch the blanket of accreditation for they liberal art school to cover the shiver body of they fine art department this plus the habit of many school of simply add interior design to the many subject of they home economics department yet nevertheless claim that they teach interior design have contribute to the low repute of many university course in interior design in spite of this many university offer adequate and even distinguish course in the subject there will be no mitigation of these offence until all art school whether independent or attach to university have separate accreditation a do medical school by an art accreditation group such a the national association of school of art independent art school grant degree must naturally follow this with academic accreditation by the appropriate regional group
