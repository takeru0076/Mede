another element to concern the choreographer be that of the visual device of the theatre most avant-garde creator true to they interest in the self-sufficiency of pure movement have tend to dress they dancer in simple line and solid color often black and to give they a bare cyclorama for a set but robert rauschenberg the neo-dadaist artist have collaborate with several of they he have design a match backdrop and costume of point of color on white for mr cunningham s summerspace so that dancer and background merge into a shimmer unity for mr taylor s image and reflection she make some diaphanous tent that alternately hide and reveal the performer and a girl s cape line with grass mr nikolais have make a distinctive contribution to the art of costume and decor in fact he call he production dance-theatre work of motion shape light and sound to raise the dancer out of he personal pedestrian self mr nikolais have experiment with relate he to a large environmental orbit he begin with mask to make the dancer identify himself with the creature he appear to be he go on to use object hoop pole cape which he employ a extension of the body of the dancer who move with they the depersonalization continue a the dancer be far metamorphose by the play of light upon he figure in each case the object the color even the percussive sound of the electronic score be design to become part of the theatrical be of the performer the dancer who never loosen she hold on a parasol begin to feel that it be part of herself or clad from head to toe in fabric stretch over a series of hoop the performer may well lose he sense of self in be a finial a the dancer be depersonalize he accouterments be animized and the combine element give birth to a new be from this be come new movement idea that utilize dancer and property a a single unit thus the avant-garde choreographer have extend the scope of material available for dance composition but since they have reject both narrative and emotional continuity how be they to unify the impressive array of material at they disposal some look deliberately to device use by creator in the other art and apply correspond method to they own work other less consciously but quite probably influence by the trend of the time experiment with approach that parallel those of the contemporary poet painter and musician an approach that have appeal to some choreographer be reminiscent of charles olson s statement of the process of projective verse one perception must immediately and directly lead to a far perception the creator trust he intuition to lead he along a path that have internal validity because it mirror the reality of he experience he disdain external restriction conventional syntax traditional metre the unit of form be determine subjectively the heart by the way of the breath to the line the test of form be fidelity to the experience a gauge also accept by the abstract expressionist painter an early but still influential school of painting surrealism have suggest the way of deal with the dream experience that event in which seemingly incongruous object be link together through the curious association of the subconscious the result picture might appear a maze of restless confusion and contradiction but it be more true to life than a portrait of an artificially contrive order the contemporary painter tend to depict not the concrete object of he experience but they essence a reveal in abstraction of they line color mass and energy he be still concern however with a personal event he accept the accident of he brushwork because they provide evidence of the vitality of the experience of creation the work must be true to both the physical and the spiritual character of the experience some painter have less interest in the experience of the moment with it attendant urgency and ambiguity than in look beyond the flux of particular impression to a high more serene level of truth rather than put they trust in ephemeral sensation they seek form in the stable relationship of pure design which symbolize an order more real than the disorder of the perceptual world the concept remain subjective but in this approach it be the artist s ultimate insight rather than he immediate impression that give form to the work other look to more objective device of order the musician employ the serial technique of composition establish a mathematical system of rotation that once set in motion determine the sequence of pitch and even of rhythm and intensity the composer may reverse or invert the order of he original set of interval or rhythm or dynamic change he may even alter the pattern by apply a scheme of random number but he can not order he element by will either rational or inspire the system work a an impersonal mechanism musician who use the chance method also exclude subjective control of formal development again the composer must select he own material but a toss of coin with perhaps the add safeguard of reference to the oracle of the i ching the chinese book of change dictate the handle of the choose material avant-garde choreographer seek new form of continuity for they new vocabulary of movement have turn to similar approach some let dance take they form from the experience of creation accord to katherine litz the become the process of realization be the dance the process stipulate that the choreographer sense the quality of the initial movement he have discover and that he feel the rightness of the quality that be to follow it the sequence may involve a sharp contrast for example a quiet meditative sway of the body succeed by a violent leap or it may involve more subtle distinction the sway may be gradually minimize or enlarge it rhythmic emphasis may be slightly modify or it may be transfer to become a movement of only the arm or the head even the least alteration will change the quality an exploration of these possible relationship constitute the process of creation and thereby give form to the dance the approach to the depiction of the experience of creation may be analytic a it be for miss litz or spontaneous a it be for merle marsicano she too be concern with the become the process of realization but she do not think in term of subtle variation of spatial or temporal pattern the design be determine emotionally i must reach into myself for the spring that will send i catapult recklessly into the chaos of event with which the dance confront i look back miss marsicano feel that she idea may have be influence by those of jackson pollock at one time she feel impel to make dance that move all over the stage much a pollock s painting move violently over the full extent of the canvas but she conscious need be to break away from constrict pattern of form a need to let the experience shape itself midi garth also believe in subjective continuity that begin with the feel engender by an initial movement it may be a free front-back swing of the leg lead to a sideways swing of the arm that develop into a turn and the sensation of take off from the ground this become a dance call prelude to flight a pervade quality of free lyricism and a build from turn close to the ground towards jump into the air give the work it central focus alwin nikolais object to art a an outpouring of personal emotion he seek to make he dancer more godlike by relate they to the impersonal element of shape light color and sound if he dancer be sometimes make to look a if they might be creature from mar this be consistent with he intention of place they in the orbit of another world a world in which they be free of they pedestrian identity it be through the metamorphose dancer that the germ of form be discover in he recognition of he impersonal self the dancer move and this self in the first reveal stroke of it existence state the theme from which all else must follow the theme may be the formation of a shape from which other shape evolve it may be a reaction to a percussive sound the follow movement constitute far reaction it may establish the relation of the figure of the dancer to light and color in which case change in the light or color will set off a kaleidescope of visual design unconcerned with the practical function of he action the dancer be engross exclusively in they motional content movement unfold freely because they be uninhibited by emotional bias or purposive drive but the metamorphosis must come first though he be also concern with free dance from pedestrian mode of activity merce cunningham have select a very different method for achieve he aim he reject all subjectively motivate continuity any line of action relate to the concept of cause and effect he base he approach on the belief that anything can follow anything an order can be chance rather than choose and this approach produce an experience that be free and discover rather than bind and remember thus there be freshness not only in the individual movement of the dance but in the shape of they continuity a well chance he find enable he to create a world beyond imagination he cite with pleasure the comment of a lady who exclaim after a concert why it s extremely interest but i would never have think of it myself the sequence of movement in a cunningham dance be unlike any sequence to be see in life at one side of the stage a dancer jump excitedly nearby another sit motionless while still another be twirl an umbrella a man and a girl happen to meet they look straight at the audience not at each other he lift she put she down and walk off neither please nor disturb a if nothing have happen if one dancer slap another the victim may do a pirouette sit down or offer he assailant a fork and spoon event occur without apparent reason they consequence be irrelevant or there be no consequence at all the sequence be determine by chance and mr cunningham make use of any one of several chance device he may toss coin he may take slip of paper from a grab bag the answer derive by these mean may determine not only the temporal organization of the dance but also it spatial design special slip designate the location on the stage where the movement be to be perform the other variable include the dancer who be to perform the movement and the length of time he be to take in it performance the only factor that be personally set by the choreographer be the movement themselves the number of the dancer and the approximate total duration of the dance the approximate be important because even after the order of the work have be establish by the chance method the result be not inviolable each performance may be different if a work be divide into several large segment a last-minute draw of random number may determine the order of the segment for any particular performance and any sequence can not only change it position in the work but can even be eliminate from it altogether mr cunningham try not to cheat the chance method he adhere to it dictate a faithfully a he can however there be always the possibility that chance will make demand the dancer find impossible to execute then the choreographer must arbitrate he must rearrange matter so that two performer do not bump into each other he must construct transition so that a dancer who be tell to lie prone one second and to leap wildly the next will have some physical preparation for the leap
