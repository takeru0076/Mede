the set of all decision be call the operate policy or more simply the policy an optimal policy be one which in some sense get the good out of the process a a whole by maximize the value of the product there be thus three component to an optimal design problem 1 the specification of the state of the process stream 2 the specification of the operate variable and the transformation they effect 3 the specification of the objective function of which the optimization be desire for a chemical process the first of these might involve the concentration of the different chemical species and the temperature or pressure of the stream for the second we might have to choose the volume of reactor or amount of cool to be supply the way in which the transformation of state depend on the operate variable for the main type of reactor be discuss in the next chapter the objective function be some measure of the increase in value of the stream by process it be the subject of chapter 4 the essential characteristic of an optimal policy when the state of the stream be transform in a sequence of stage with no feedback be first isolate by bellman he recognize that whatever transformation may be effect in the first stage of an r-stage process the remain stage must use an optimal af-stage policy with respect to the state result from the first stage if there be to be any chance of optimize the complete process moreover by systematically vary the operate condition in the first stage and always use the optimal af-stage policy for the remain stage we shall eventually find the optimal policy for all r stage proceed in this way from one to two and from two to three stage we may gradually build up the policy for any number at each step of the calculation the operate variable of only one stage need be vary to see how important this economy be let we suppose that there be m operate variable at each stage and that the state be specify by n variable then the search for the maximum at any one stage will require a number of operation of order afj where a be some number not unreasonably large to proceed from one stage to the next a sufficient number of feed state must be investigate to allow for interpolation this number will be of the order of afj if however we be seek the optimal r-stage policy for a give feed state only one search for a maximum be require at the final step thus a number of operation of the order of afj be require if all the operate variable be vary simultaneously afj operation would be require to do the same job and a r increase this increase very much more rapidly than the number of operation require by the dynamic program but even more important than this be the fact that the direct search by simultaneously vary all operate condition have produce only one optimal policy namely that for the give feed state and r stage in contrast the dynamic program produce this policy and a whole family of policy for any small number of stage if the problem be enlarge to require a complete coverage of feed state afj operation be need by the dynamic program and afj by the direct search but afj be vastly large than r no optimism be more baseless than that which believe that the high speed of modern digital computer allow for use of the crude of method in search out a result suppose that afj and that the average operation require only afj sec then the dynamic program would require about a minute whereas the direct search would take more than three millennia the principle of optimality thus bring a vital organization into the search for the optimal policy of a multistage decision process bellman 1957 have annunciated in the follow term an optimal policy have the property that whatever the initial state and initial decision be the remain decision must constitute an optimal policy with respect to the state result from the first decision this be the principle which we will invoke in every case to set up a functional equation it appear in a form that be admirably suit to the power of the digital computer at the same time every device that can be employ to reduce the number of variable be of the great value and it be one of the attractive feature of dynamic program that room be leave for ingenuity in use the special feature of the problem to this end 22 the discrete deterministic process consider the process illustrate in fig 21 consist of r distinct stage these will be number in the direction opposite to the flow of the process stream so that stage r be the t stage from the end let the state of the stream leave stage r be denote by a vector afj and the operate variable of stage r by afj thus afj denote the state of the feed to the r-stage process and afj the state of the product from the last stage each stage transform the state afj of it feed to the state afj in a way that depend on the operate variable afj we write this afj this transformation be uniquely determine by afj and we therefore speak of the process a deterministic in practical situation there will be restriction on the admissible operate condition and we regard the vector a belong to a fix and bound set s the set of vector afj constitute the operate policy or more briefly the policy and a policy be admissible if all the afj belong to s when the policy have be choose the state of the product can be obtain from the state of the feed by repeat application of the transformation 1 thus afj the objective function which be to be maximize be some function usually piecewise continuous of the product state let this be denote by afj an optimal policy be an admissible policy afj which maximize the objective function p the policy may not be unique but the maximum value of p certainly be and once the policy be specify this maximum can be calculate by 2 and 3 a a function of the feed state afj let afj where the maximization be over all admissible policy afj when it be necessary to be specific we say that the optimal policy be an optimal r-stage policy with respect to the feed state afj for any choice of admissible policy afj in the first stage the state of the stream leave this stage be give by afj this be the feed state of the subsequent afj stage which accord to the principle of optimality must use an optimal af-stage policy with respect to this state this will result in a value afj of the objective function and when afj be choose correctly this will give afj the maximum of the objective function thus afj where the maximization be over all admissible policy afj and afj be relate to afj by 5 the sequence of equation 6 can be solve for afj when afj be know and clearly afj the maximization be over all admissible afj the set of equation 5 6 and the start equation 7 be of a recursive type well suit to program on the digital computer in find the optimal r-stage policy from that of afj stage only the function afj be need when afj have be find it may be transfer into the storage location of afj and the whole calculation repeat we also see how the result may be present although if n the number of state variable be large any tabulation will become cumbersome a table or set of table may be set out a in table 21 to extract the optimal r-stage policy with respect to the feed state afj we enter section r of this table at the state afj and find immediately from the last column the maximum value of the objective function in the third column be give the optimal policy for stage r and in the fourth the result state of the stream when this policy be use since by the principle of optimality the remain stage use an optimal af-stage policy with respect to afj we may enter section afj of the table at this state afj and read off the optimal policy for stage afj and the result state afj proceed in this way up the table we extract the complete optimal policy and if it be desire we can check on afj by evaluate afj at the last stage it may be that the objective function depend not only on afj but also on afj a when the cost of the operate policy be consider a moment s reflection show that the above algorithm and presentation work equally well in this case a form of objective function that we shall often have occasion to consider be afj here p represent the value of the stream in state p and q the cost of operate the stage with condition q hence p be the increase in value of the stream minus the cost of operation that be the net profit if afj denote the net profit from stage r and afj then the principle of optimality give afj this sequence of equation may be start with the remark that with no process afj there be no profit ie af 23 the discrete stochastic process the process in which the outcome of any one stage be know only statistically be also of interest although for chemical reactor design it be not a important a the deterministic process in this case the stage r operate with condition afj transform the state of the stream from afj to afj but only the probability distribution of afj be know this be specify by a distribution function afj such that the probability that afj lie in some region d of the stage space be afj we can not now speak of maximize the value of the objective function since this function be now know only in a probabilistic sense we can however maximize it expect value for a single stage we may define afj where the maximization be by choice of afj we thus have an optimal policy which maximize the expect value of the objective function for a give afj if we consider a process in which the outcome of one stage be know before passage to the next then the principle of optimality show that the policy in subsequent stage should be optimal with respect to the outcome of the first then afj the maximization be over all admissible afj and the integration over the whole of stage space the type of presentation of result use in the deterministic process may be use here except that now the fourth column be redundant the third column give the optimal policy but we must wait to see the outcome of stage r and enter the precede section of the table at this state the discussion of the optimal policy when the outcome of one stage be not know before pass to the next be a very much more difficult matter 24 the continuous deterministic process in many case it be not possible to divide the process into a finite number of discrete stage since the state of the stream be transform in a continuous manner through the process we replace r the number of the stage from the end of the process by t a continuous variable which measure the distance of the point consider from the end of the process the word distance be use here in a rather general sense it may in fact be the time that will elapse before the end of the process if t be the total length of the process it feed state may be denote by a vector p t and the product state by p q p denote the state at any point t and q the vector of operate variable there
