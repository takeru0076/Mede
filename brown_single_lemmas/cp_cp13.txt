she find herself run from they flee wildly through the tree dodge she own shadow until she come to a little hollow in the rocky ground with a big stone in the center behind which she kneel and hide listen to the madness of she heart and want for once to cry for a while the young man wait outside the lodge of tuhulhulzote glory in he harsh language a he talk with himself he shout like a hoarse old mastiff he hair stiff and bristle he rant and prophesy the doom of he enemy walk in circle in and out of he live place drink steal whisky in great gasp draught until finally incoherent and sick he fall into he own oblivion he amuse the young man who have be silent long enough but they could taste the appeasement of violence and retribution through he antic now they move rub they flesh alive again disdain the gloom they see in the face around they they come out and hold they game and race it be they who hold the future in they hand they go into the sun together and parade grandly in they

they horse in swift maneuver fire they few gun in unison at some indeterminate signal walitzee be among they and sarpsis and they wear red blanket which fly like broad wing in the air of they pass and a very young one swan necklace try to emulate they and follow timidly yellow wolf be there nephew of the young chief by an old brother long dead in whom also the disorder chemistries of youth work he would spring bolt upright suddenly after sit quietly with inaction because something have boil over in he ferment juice all the young man alokut among they challenge they in match race they race and maneuver for war swing they horse in single file and then abreast like cavalry at time they would ride frenziedly through the camp let the woman see they courage how handsome they be in they regalia then again they would stand in circle make other preparation they comb they hair and streak it at the part and grease the bang so that the hair above they forehead stand rigid like the tail of sage hen make love walitzee whiten he legging with clay know the girl watch from she place in the tree he see himself in a superior reflection and he be a a speed arrow from the taut bow hurtle with a mad grace he maleness shine and scent with meadow rue he be always aware of the woman s eye which follow he admire he and the suspicious envenomed eye of pile of cloud and those of early spring haunt and now full of hurt and envy he feel so much like laugh even like shout and cry out from the hilltop from which he could descend a an eagle in a mad caper from the cliff he and sarpsis plan a great parade with the young man they would give one final testimony of they challenge to let the people see they arrogance they would ride with stream amulet they color ripen in the sun shout the last bellicosity of a nation in the throe of death and so the sun come up again and for a moment it color be the young man s blood shift then into the full heat and outcry which run with they heart they mount they horse and ride off into the hill the young chief stare at the wall of he lodge listen the sound rise on the other side of the hill vanish and rise again and he could imagine the mad disheveled hoof of the appaloosas horse the white man once have call the dog of hell he see they in fleet image a they come roll and now burst across the ridge stand then with the other peer into the sun he see the bright multicolored legion they hair fly like dark banner only the thunder the roll of drum the mad cacophony of the hoof accompany they they lean into the wind and seem like one thousand-legged monster hurtle and plunge until suddenly they rise straight in they saddle and in one terrify voice shout ejaculate they grotesque cry of war
