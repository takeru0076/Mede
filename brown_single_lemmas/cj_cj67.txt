anglo-saxon and greek epic each provide on two occasion a seemingly authentic account of the narration of verse in the heroic age hrothgar s court bard sing of the encounter at finnsburg line 1068 -

aphrodite odyssey 8 266-366 and take up a tale of odysseus while the ithacan wanderer listen on odyssey 8 499-520 nothing in all this be autobiographical unlike the poet of deor and widsith the poet of beowulf be not concern with he own identity the poet of the odyssey repute blind reveal himself not at all in sing of the blind minstrel demodocus since none of these glimpse of poetizing without write be intend to incorporate a signature into the epic matter there be prima-facie evidence that beowulf and the homeric poem each derive from an oral tradition that such a tradition lie behind the iliad and the odyssey at least be hard to deny milman parry rigorously defend the observation that the extant homeric poem be largely formulaic and be lead to postulate that they could be show entirely formulaic if the complete corpus of greek epic survive he far reason that frequent formula in epic verse indicate oral composition and assume the slightly less likely corollary that oral epic be incline towards the use of formula proceed from parry s conclusion and adopt one of he schema francis p magoun jr argue that beowulf likewise be create from a legacy of oral formula inherit and extend by bard of successive generation and the thesis be strike and compel yet a fresh inspection will indicate one crucial amendment beowulf and the homeric poem be not at all formulaic to the same extent the bondage endurable by an oral poet be to be estimate only by a very skilful oral poet but it appear safe to assume that no sustain narrative in rhyme could be compose without extreme difficulty even in a language of many terminal inflection assonance seem nearly a severe a curb although in a celebrate passage william of malmesbury declare that a song of roland be intone before the battle commence at hasting the anglo-saxon alliterative line and the homeric hexameter probably impose less of a restraint the verse of beowulf or of the iliad and the odyssey be not easy to create but be not impossible for poet who have develop they talent perforce in earn a livelihood yet certain aid be valuable and quite credibly necessary for recite long stretch of verse without a pause the poet in a write tradition who generally never blot a line may once in a while pause and polish without incur blame but the oral poet can not pause he must improvise continuously with no apparent effort even though the bondage of he verse be not so great a the write poet can manage it be still great enough for he often to be seriously impede unless he have aid to facilitate rapid composition the germanic poet have such aid in the kennings which provide for the difficulty of alliteration the homeric poet have epithet which provide for recur need in the hexameter either poet could quickly and easily select word or phrase to supply he immediate requirement a he chant out he line because the kennings and the epithet make possible the construction of system of numerous synonym for the chief common and proper noun other synonym could of course serve the same function and for the sake of ease i shall speak of kennings and epithet in the wide and loos possible sense and name for example gar-dene a kenning for the dane verbal and adverbial element too participate in each epic diction but it be for the present sufficient to mark the large nominal and adjectival supply of semantic near-equivalents and to designate the member of any system of equivalent a basic formula of the poetic language limit to a few thousand line of heroic verse in anglo-saxon a in the other germanic dialect we can not say how frequently the kennings in beowulf recur in contemporary epic on the same soil but we can say that since a write poet with leisure before he would seem unlikely to invent a technique base upon frequent and substantial circumlocution the kennings like the epithet must reasonably be ascribe to an oral tradition one of the great homerists of we time frederick m combellack argue that when it be assume the iliad and the odyssey be oral poem the postulate single redactor call homer can not be either credit with or deny originality in choice of phrase any example of grand or exquisite diction may have be create by the poet who compile numerous lay into the two work we possess or may be due to one of he completely unknown fellow-craftsmen the quest of the historical homer be likely never to have far success no individual word in the iliad or the odyssey can be credit to any one man no strikingly effective element of speech in the extant poem can with assurance be say not to have be a commonplace in the vast epic corpus that may have exist at the begin of the first millennium before christ this observation be of interest not only to student of homeric poetry but to student of anglo-saxon poetry a well to the extent that a tale be twice tell it final author must be suspect although plagiarism in an oral tradition be less a misdemeanor than the standard modus dicendi combellack argue far and here he make he main point that once the iliad and the odyssey be think formulaic poem compose for an audience accustom to formulaic poetry homeric critic be deprive of an entire domain they previously find arable with a few important and a few more unimportant exception no expression can be deem le mot juste for it context because each be very probably the only expression that long-established practice and ease of rapid recitation would allow word or phrase that connoisseur have admire a handsome or ironic or humorous must therefore lose merit and become regard a mere inevitable time-server sometimes accurate and sometimes not this observation too may have reference to anglo-saxon poetry to the extent that a language be formulaic it individual component must be regard a no more distinguish than other cliche wf bryan suggest that certain kennings in beowulf be select sometimes for appropriateness and sometimes for ironic inappropriateness but such a view would appear untenable unless it be deny that the language of beowulf be formulaic if the master of scop who be most responsible for the poem ever use kennings that be traditional he be at least partly deprive of free will and not incline towards shrewd and sophisticate misuse of speech element once many significant phrase be find in theory or in recurrent practice to provide for prosodic necessity they be not to be defend for they semantic property in isolate context it be false to be certain of have discover in the language of beowulf such effect a intentional irony yet if the argument be turn awry there may be find a great deal in bryan s view after all a formulaic element need not be hold meaningless merely because it be select with little conscious reflection time-server though the periphrastic expression be they may nevertheless be handsome or ironic or humorous a long evolution in an oral tradition cause the poetic language of the heroic age to be base upon formula that show the important quality of thing and these formula be therefore potentially rather than always actually accurate true we do not know how they be regard in they day but we need not believe the epic audience to have be more insensitive to the formula than the numerous scholar of modern time who have read germanic or homeric poetry all they life and still find much to admire in occasional occurrence of the most familiar phrase noun and adjective in a write tradition be choose for the nonce in an oral tradition they may be choose for the entire epic corpus and tend towards idealization rather than distinctive delineation reliance be therefore not to be place upon the archaeological particulars in an oral poem no-one today would hope to discover the unmistakable ruin of heorot or the palace of priam a ship at dry-dock could be call a foamy-necked floater in anglo-saxon or a swift ship in greek even when defenseless of weapon the dane would be gar-dene a they king be hrothgar and priam would be eummelihs achille like siegfried in the nibelungenlied be potentially the swift of man and may accordingly be call swift-footed even when he stand idle in coriolanus the agnomen of marcius be use deliberately and pointedly but the homeric epithet and the anglo-saxon kennings be use casually and recall to the hearer a familiar story or situation or a useful or pleasant quality of the referent the epic language be not entirely the servant of the poet it be partly he master the poet s intention be difficult to discern and except to biographer unimportant the language however be a proper object of scrutiny and the effect of the language be palpable even if sometimes inevitable beowulf and the homeric poem appear oral composition yet they be write at some stage in they evolution they be transcribe albert b lord suggest that the homeric poem be dictate to a scribe by a minstrel who hold in he mind the poem fully mature but do not himself possess the knowledge of write since it would be useless to he guild and magoun argue that the beowulf poet and cynewulf may have dictate they verse in the same fashion this explanation be attractive but be vitiate at least in part by the observation that cynewulf though he use kennings in the traditional manner be a literate man who four time inscribe he name by rune into he work if cynewulf be literate the beowulf poet may have be also and so may the final redactor of the iliad and the odyssey in lieu of the amanuensis to the blind or illiterate bard one may conceive of a man who hear a vast store of oral poetry recite and become intimately familiar with the establish aid to poetizing and himself write he own composition or he edition of the composition of the past other theory of origin be compatible with the formulaic theory beowulf may contain a design for terror and the iliad may have a vast hysteron-proteron pattern answer to a ceramic pattern produce during the geometric period in pottery the account of the growth and final transcription of these epic rest partly however upon the degree to which they be formulaic carl eduard schmidt count 1804 different line repeat exactly in the two homeric poem and by increase this figure so a to include line repeat with very slight modification he count 2118 different line use a total of 5612 time thus one line in five from the iliad and the odyssey be to be find somewhere else in the two poem the ratio be thoroughly remarkable because the line be so long half again a long a those of beowulf anglo-saxon poetry appear to have no comparable amount of repetition there be no reason to think that the scop use and re-use whole line and even lengthy passage after the manner of he homeric colleague in determine the extent to which any poem be formulaic it be idle however to inspect nothing besides line repeat in they entirety for a stock of line-fragments would be sufficient to permit the poet to extemporize with deftness if they provide for prosodic need the close scrutiny be owe to the anglo-saxon kennings and the homeric epithet if any word or phrase be formulaic they will be the iliad have two word for the shield aspis and sakos
