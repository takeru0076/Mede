origin of state automobile practice the practice of state-owned vehicle for use of employee on business date back over forty year at least one state vehicle be in existence in 1917 the state presently own 389 passenger vehicle in comparison to approximately 200 in 1940 the automobile maintenance unit or motor pool come into existence in 1942 and have be responsible for centralize maintenance and management of state-owned transportation since that time the motor pool have make exceptional progress in automotive management include establishment of cost bill system record keep analysis of vehicle use and effect economy in vehicle operation car be operate in 1959 for an average $ 027 per mile purchase of state vehicle be handle similarly to all state purchase unit price to the state be considerably low than to the general public because of quantity purchase and no payment of state sales or federal excise tax vehicle purchase assignment and use policy the legislature s role in policy determination concern state-owned vehicle have be confine almost exclusively to appropriate fund for vehicle the meaningful policy govern the purchase assignment use and management of state vehicle have be shape by the state s administrative officer meaningful policy include a kind of car the state should own b when car should be trade c the need and assignment of vehicle d use of car in lieu of mileage allowance e employee take car home and f need for liability insurance on state automobile a review of these policy indicate 1 the state purchase and assign grade of car accord to need and position status of driver and use of vehicle 2 the purchase of compact economy car be be make currently on a test basis 3 car be trade mostly on a three-year basis in the interest of economy 4 the factor govern need and assignment of car be flexible accord to circumstance 5 unsuccessful effort have be make to replace high mileage allowance with state automobile 6 it be reasonably economical for the state to have driver garage state car at they home 7 the state have recently undertake liability insurance for driver of state car automobile practice in other state a survey of practice and policy in other state concern assignment and use of state automobile reveal several point for comparison with rhode island s practice forty-seven state assign or provide vehicle for employee on state business two other state provide vehicle but only with legislative approval state which provide automobile for employee assign they variously to the agency the individual or to a central pool twenty-six state operate a central motor pool for acquisition allocation and maintenance of state-owned vehicle nineteen state report law policy or regulation for assign state vehicle in lieu of pay mileage allowance of these state the average change-over point at which a car be substitute for allowance be 13200 mile per year mileage allowance mileage allowance for state employee be of two type a actual mileage and b fix monthly allowance actual mileage allowance be itemize reimbursement allow employee for the use of personally-owned vehicle on state business at the rate of $ 07 per mile fix monthly allowance be reimbursement for the same purpose except on a non-itemized basis both allowance be govern by condition and restriction set forth in detail in the state s travel regulation rhode island s reimburseable rate of $ 07 per mile for use of personally-owned car compare favorably with other state rate the average of state rate be $ 076 per mile rhode island s rate of $ 07 per mile be considerably low than reimburseable rate in the federal government and in industry nationally which approximate a $ 09 per mile average actual mileage allowance be well-administered and not unduly expensive for the state the travel regulation requirement and procedure govern reimbursement be control properly and not overly restrictive fix monthly allowance be a controversial subject they have a great advantage in ease of audit time and payment however they lend themselves to abuse and inadequate control measure flat payment over $ 50 per month be more expensive to the state than the assignment of state-owned vehicle travel allowance travel allowance include subsistence have be revise by administrative official recently and compare favorably with other state allowance with few exception traveler on state business be allow actual travel expense and $ 15 per day subsistence travel allowance be well-regulated and pose little problem in administration and audit control origin of state automobile practice general background it be difficult to pinpoint the time of origin of the state purchase automobile for use of employee in rhode island few record be available concern the subject prior to 1940 those that be available shed little light the registry of motor vehicle indicate that at least one state automobile be register a far back a 1917 it should be enough to say that the practice of the state buy automobile be at least forty year old the good reason that can be advance for the state adopt the practice be the advent of expand highway construction during the 1920s and 30s at that time highway engineer travel rough and dirty road to accomplish they duty use privately-owned vehicle be a personal hardship for such employee and the matter of provide state transportation be feel perfectly justifiable once the principle be establish the increase in state-owned vehicle come rapidly and reason other than employee need contribute to the growth table 1 immediately below show the rate of growth of vehicle and employee this rate of increase do not signify anything in itself it do not indicate loose management ineffective control or poor policy but it do show that automobile have increase steadily over the year and in almost the same proportion to the increase of state employee in the past twenty year the ratio of state-owned automobile per state employee have vary from 1 to 22 then to 1 to 23 now whether there be too few automobile in 1940 or too many now be problematical the fact be simply that state-owned vehicle have remain in practically the same proportion a employee to use they history and operation of the motor pool while the origin of state-owned automobile may be obscure subsequent development concern the assignment use and management of state automobile can be relate more clearly prior to 1942 automobile be the individual responsibility of the agency to which assign this responsibility include all phase of management it embrace determine when to purchase and when to trade vehicle who be to drive when and where repair be to be make where gasoline and automobile service be to be obtain and other ally matter in 1942 however the nation be at war gasoline and automobile tire be ration commodity the state be confront with transportation problem similar to those of the individual it meet these problem by the creation of the state automobile maintenance unit more popularly call the motor pool a centralize operation for the maintenance and control of all state transportation the motor pool then a now have headquarter facility in providence and other garage locate throughout the state it be organizationally the responsibility of the department of public work and be finance on a rotary fund basis with each agency of government contribute to the pool s operation in 1951 the pool s operation be transfer to the newly-created department of administration an agency establish a the central staff and auxiliary department of the state government the management of state-owned vehicle since that time have be describe in a recent report in the follow manner under this new management considerable progress appear to have be make the agency of government be now bill for the actual cost of service provide to each passenger car rather than the prior uniform charge for all car whereas the maintenance rotary fund have in the past sustain loss considerably beyond expectation the introduction of the cost-billing system plus other control refinement have result in keep the fund on a proper work basis one indication of the merit of the new management be find in the fact that during the period 1951-1956 while total annual mileage put on the vehicle increase 35 % the total maintenance cost increase only 11 % in order to far refine the management of passenger vehicle on july 1 1958 the actual title to every vehicle be transfer by executive order to the division of method research and office service the objective behind this action be to place in one agency the responsibility for the management assignment and replacement of all vehicle note so far a state police car be concern only they replacement be under this division this tie in closely with the current attempt to upgrade state-owned car to the extent that vehicle be not retain beyond the point where maintenance cost in light of depreciation become excessive moreover it allow the present management to reassign vehicle so that mileage will be more uniformly distribute throughout the fleet for example if one driver put on 22000 mile per year and another driver 8000 mile per year they car will be switch so that both car will have 30000 mile after two year rather than 44000 mile and relate high maintenance cost and 16000 mile respectively the motor pool be a completely centralize and mechanize operation it handle all type of vehicle maintenance but concentrate more on service station activity than on extensive vehicle repair it contract with outside repair garage for much of the latter work where the pool excel be in it compilation of maintenance and cost-data study and analysis pool record reveal in detail the cost per mile and mile per gallon of each vehicle the mile travel in one year or three year the period when vehicle cost become excessive and when car should be trade for sound economy from this motor pool personnel develop other meaningful and relate data in 1959-60 vehicle average an operate cost of $ 027 per mile base on this figure and consider depreciation cost of vehicle pool personnel have determine that travel in excess of 10000 mile annually be more economical by state car than by payment of allowance for use of personally-owned vehicle they estimate far that with sufficient experience and when cost-data of compact car be compile the break-even point may be reduce to 7500 mile of travel per year table 2 show operate cost data of state vehicle select at random one matter of concern to the complete effectiveness of pool operation be the lack of adequate central garage facility present pool quarter at two location in providence be crowd antiquated and in general make for inefficient operation in term of dispersement of personnel and duplication of such operational need a stock and repair equipment good facility would be a decide help to pool operation and probably reduce vehicle cost even more purchase practice the purchase of state-owned vehicle be handle in the same manner a all other purchase of the state request be make by the motor pool along with any necessary cooperation from the agency to which assignment of car will be make bid be evaluate by the division of purchase with the assistance of pool staff and award for the purchase of the automobile be make to the low responsible bidder unit price for state vehicle be invariably low than to the general public the reason be obvious 1 the state be buy in quantity and 2 it have no federal excise or state sales tax to pay until 1958 the state be also entitle to a special type of manufacturer discount through the dealer in that ownership of all vehicle rest with the state motor pool car be pay for with fund appropriate to the agency but transfer to the rotary fund mention early this be a normal governmental procedure which reflect more accurately cost-accounting principle the assignment and use of vehicle after purchase be another matter to be cover in detail late vehicle purchase assignment and use policy probably the most important of all matter for review be the broad administrative policy govern the purchase assignment use and management of state vehicle the legislature s role in policy determination in this area for year have be confine almost solely to the amount of fund appropriate annually for the purchase and operation of vehicle the more meaningful policy have be leave to the judgment of the chief administrative officer of the state the director of administration
