or both but he new-found buddy have match he drink for drink until he lose count and the man s eye be still clear the guy be off he rocker haney think to himself and look away from those eye eye that be clear but also bright with a strange intensity a sort of cold fire burn behind they why have nt he notice it before no the man be not drink he wonder how he get tie up with this strange but of course he remember now it be blur after two hour of steady drink but the occasion of it come back to he the strange he head seemingly sink in think start to cross the street against the light just a a huge move van roar through the intersection brake howl and a horn blare furiously but the man would have be hit if phil have nt call out to he a second before he shout have be involuntary something anybody might have do without think on the spur of the moment a a matter of fact he would nt have care at all if the guy have be hit actually he regret have open he mouth when the truck come to a stop and the angry driver jump down from the cab and walk back toward they by then the strange be thank haney profusely and have one arm around he shoulder a if he be an old friend so the driver start to curse at both of they a if they have be in a plot together to ruin he safe-driving record then the man he save turn and look squarely into the truck driver s face without say a word very suddenly the driver stop swear at they turn on he heel and go back to he truck haney have nt give it much think at the time now he recall it very clearly and wonder what the truck driver have see in those eye to make he back off it must have be the sort of look that can call a bluff without say a word when the light go they way they go on across the street and when the strange find out that phil be on the way to one of he favorite bar he insist on offer to buy drink for both of they phil usually go alone and keep to himself sit in a corner and pass the time by nurse he favorite grudge but he decide he would nt mind company in return for free drink even though he make good money at he job phil be like that now he wonder if it be worth it have a screwball for company he really do nt take the offer seriously but he begin to feel uneasy when he finally get the cough under control he realize that pete all he give be he first name be still wait for an answer he do nt even seem to wink a he continue to stare haney manage a weak laugh guess i can nt think of anyone pete thank anyhow a faint crease appear between the man s eyebrow i think you be nt take i seriously phil i mean it and everybody have some kind of grudge i might have get hit by that truck if it be nt for you i believe in return favor i ll do anything for somebody i like it will nt cost you a cent phil go ahead and try i phil rub he forehead wearily he be begin to feel woolly maybe it would be good to humor the guy and then make an exit he really do nt expect anything to come of it and there be a few people all right he concede finally if you must know i do nt get along with the landlord he keep ride i because i like to listen to the radio and sing while i m take a bath he say the neighbor complain but i do nt believe it why do nt they tell i themselves if it bother they the man close he eye and nod when he look up again he seem almost content fine give i you address it will take a little time i want to study you landlord s habit and movement first you see i always make it look like an accident maybe suicide if it look reasonable in that way there s no trouble for the customer haney s eyebrow fly up customer pete smile modestly it s i line of work he say five minute late before haney could make he break the strange stand up and nod farewell haney watch the small but wiry man slip out the door quickly and silently and feel relieve to see that nobody else seem to notice he departure phil decide to stay a little long and a time pass it seem a if the strange little man have never be there but for the other glass on the table some time before midnight he return to he apartment and hit the sack put the whole incident out of mind before he fall asleep the next day sunday the hangover remind haney where he have be the night before the hangover in turn remind he of he conversation with the weirdy and he groan he go for more aspirin late in the day and pass the surly landlord on the way he be still alive and scowl a usual a if tenant be a burden in he life phil shrug and ignore he he go back to work monday by wednesday the landlord be still alive of course on thursday haney mail the monthly check for separate maintenance to he wife lolly and wish the strange could do something about she come home from work he be startle to see a police car park in front of the apartment build inside the lobby people be stand around talk excitedly he spine crawl with a foreboding premonition a he ask one of he fellow tenant what have happen the landlord have die late that afternoon it seem he have fall off the roof while on some obscure errand or inspection he have apparently be alone nobody witness the fall just the sicken impact when he body smash on the pavement just outside the basement delivery entrance haney hope that nobody notice he sudden pallor a he feel the blood drain from he cheek he mutter something about how terrible it be and walk with deliberate slowness to the elevator once inside he apartment he pour a drink with tremble hand and flop limply in a chair after a while he begin to feel good about it especially when no one bother to ask any question but after all why should they still late he finally convince himself that it be an accident just a coincidence the strange really have nothing to do with it of course haney go to bed happy that at least he be rid of that lousy landlord after all the man have no family so no one suffer and everybody be good off for it really he say to himself nobody kill a man just a a favor so you think i do nt mean what i say the strange s eye be large and sad a if phil haney have hurt he feeling it be like a recurrent annoy dream but now the dream be begin to take on overtone of a nightmare however haney know it be not a dream he might be very tight but he know where he be it be the same bar and it be two week late saturday night when he have an excuse to drink heavy than usual he have be sit in the usual corner at the little table a far a possible from any talkative friendly lush he be enjoy the weekly ritual of wash down he pet grievance with bourbon slightly moisten with water this favorite grievance be not the landlord he have already quite forget about he in fact he have only mention he on the spur of the moment he real grievance be lolly toward the end of he fourth hairy highball while he be moodily make wet ring on the table-top with the bottom of the glass he become aware that he be not alone he look up with bloodshot eye and beheld the strange sit across the table smile a secret smile at he a if they be fellow conspirator he have nt even notice what be he name pete he have nt see he sit down the man be uncanny like a shadow and make a much noise a a shadow haney feel like shrink out of sight but he be already trap in the corner with the wiry dark little man he begin to wish that he have nt shout that other even when the truck bear down through the cross be he go to be saddle from now on with a creep for a bar-buddy he d have to start go to some of the other place again in a low voice almost whisper the man have ask phil if he be happy with the way the landlord have be take off he back he make the mistake of answer in an offhand way and instantly realize that he skepticism must have show in he face or voice pete frown slightly then become sad and moody haney do nt want to encourage he company but feel he ought to buy he a drink anyhow to prevent possible trouble but there be no trouble the guy sulk over he drink obviously upset by haney s lack of appreciation to break the uncomfortable silence haney begin to talk in time and two drink late he be complain bitterly about he wife he be on the subject for ten minute or so when he notice the renew interest in he listener it show in the alert face and the suddenly bright eye when he pause to moisten he throat the strange break in but why pay she bill if she run around with other man and if you hate she a you say why not just divorce she haney scowl that bitch would love a divorce he growl then she d get half of everything i have community property deal you know i d have to sell out i business to pay she off with she share she can drop dead pete nod understandingly oh yes now i see you must understand i have nt be in this state too long i come out here to retire that s why i why i do a free job now and then you should have tell i about she before haney feel a twinge of annoyance when he hear the now familiar line again then a wild think run circle through he cloud brain suppose just suppose this guy be really what he say he be a retire professional killer if he be just a nut no harm be do but if he be the real thing he could do something about lolly he feel very cunning very proud of himself a he play on the other man s soft spot no offense intend he say gently but it s just that well you know the cop do nt suspect a thing and i think it be a coincidence after all i do nt know you pete it could have be an accident he shrug casually but if you say you manage it the strange be hook he eye burn feverishly yes yes he mutter impatiently of course it look like an accident i always work it that way and always at a time when the customer have an alibi let i prove it phil i think i can manage one more favor for you he wait eagerly haney swish the liquor in the bottom of he glass
