about halfway back pop grope against a wall and stop pull away two loosely nail wide board at one end and go through cmon he whisper floor level s about three foot down so do nt fall i go through and down into pitch darkness he say jist stay still i ll pull the board back and then get we a light jist stay where you be i jist stay where i be while he fumble around and then walk away a moment late he strike a match and light a candle and i could see it be a big room empty except for a few thing of pop s at the far end a wooden crate on which stand the candle a spread out blanket and an unrol bindle i look back over i shoulder while i go to join he he d hang another half of a blanket over the board window so no light would show through i take the pint bottle from i pocket and hand it over a i sit down beside he on the spread blanket you first i say he drink and hand it back nice place i tell he listen i get a buddy i travel with real nice guy name larry i know where he be right near here could he join the party and sleep here tonight too we ll both be blow town tomorrow so we will nt be move in on you he hesitate a second look at the bottle before he say sure-sure and i reassure he he ll bring a bottle too and i ll get another one or maybe two while i m out you can work on this one while i m go kill it if you want i take a short swallow from it myself and hand it to he he sure-sure be enthusiastic this time he put the bottle down git over by the window while there s light an i ll put th candle out when yuh come back i ll put it out agin till you re both inside charlie be wait lean against a build front perfect set-up i tell he but we get to go back to fifth and get another bottle or two on the way i ll give you the scoop on the way i give he the scoop i buy another pint of sherry and when we get back pop let we in in the dark put back the blanket and then light the candle again i introduce i friend larry to pop and we make ourselves comfortable there be still a little not much leave in the first bottle and we pass it around once and kill it and charlie open he i be remind amusedly by a poem of kenneth patchen s call the murder of two man by a young kid wear lemon colore glove which patchen himself read on a record against jazz background the poem consist of only two word the word wait repeat over and over at irregular interval and with different inflection and then the word now and a blare final chord from the jazz group this be the same except that it be the murder of one man by two man and neither of we be wear glove but we could wait all right there be no hurry i say wait wait to charlie and he grin dig the reference we d hear the record together once the second bottle pass a few time pop be take long one but not show the effect yet he seem a drink a when i d first talk to he but no drunk he have a capacity if we d really be try to get he dead drink we d have have to go out for more wine about halfway through the second bottle charlie look at i across pop who be sit between we and ask now i say wait and hand the bottle to pop for he final drink when he hand it back and i have hold of it safely pop be look toward i and i say now to charlie and he swing the short length of lead pipe he d meanwhile take from he pocket once it be a lead pipe cinch there be a sound like the one you produce by flick a watermelon with you finger only loud and pop fall forward from the waist and then over sidewise out cold if not dead and he d never know what hit he he d never know that anything have hit he i reach i hand toward he to put it inside he shirt to feel for a heartbeat but charlie say wait and say it sharply not a in the patchen bit but a an order so i stop i hand and look at he he be hold the piece of lead pipe out to i we do nt want to know whether he s dead yet i gauge that blow to be borderline to kayo he and maybe or maybe not kill you hit again about twice that hard before we know whether he s dead or not that way we ll never know which of we really kill he and which be just the accomplice dig i dig he i see he point it make sense i take the piece of pipe from charlie s hand and use it hard than he have the thunk be loud anyway and i think i hear bone crack charlie say good boy that do it if i do nt and we ll never know which all right now i ll give you a hand we straighten pop up and i make sure there be no trace of a heartbeat i nod to charlie let s put he down again the way he be it s a more natural position we do that how do you feel charlie ask i cool i tell he what do you feel nothing well maybe i m exaggerate it be a kick but not a big enough one for i to want to take the chance again except for stake but let s not talk about it abstractly until we re out of here now first question the bottle shall we take they all with we or leave one take they i say if we leave one we d have to wipe it for fingerprint here s the picture we want to leave for the fuzz whenever the body get find this happen in the middle of a drink bout with another bum if they d be work on a bottle or a jug he d have take it with he right and he d have take the weapon with he too so we take that now he look around i ve be careful about fingerprint how about you same there be the board over the window of course but they re not paint and too rough to take print same go for the rough cement of the ledge besides i doubt if the cop will even try dust they find dead wino every day maybe they will nt even autopsy he for the cause of death we can nt take a chance on that we ve get to assume they ll decide he be murder and we ve get to keep the picture consistent we hypothetical other bum who kill he would have turn out he pocket let s do that we do that and find a dirty handkerchief some match and fourteen cent in change we take the match they be book match and once they d be touch might retain fingerprint and the change we discuss the candle and decide the hypothetical other bum would have leave it burn to light he way to the window and because he d have no reason to blow it out the candle have be stick on a tin lid so it would nt set fire to the crate when it gutter out a fire would nt have matter except that it would cause pop to be find sooner he might not be find for day even week otherwise we go once more over every point then triple-checked be pick up for question by a cop on the way out seem to be the only possible remain danger and we be nt pick up by a cop in fact nobody see we cop or citizen winsett be a quiet street with no tavern and be completely desert at that hour which if it matter be one be less than three hour ago we d decide in maxine well s pad on cosmo to commit a trial murder it have go like clockwork almost too smoothly i find myself think and then tell myself that be ridiculous how safe be too safe think like that can get you into a pad pad an hour late we be back in i unpadded pad kill what have be leave of the second pint we decide to leave the third one intact for tomorrow also we plan for i to commit charlie s murder and for he to commit i but we be really go to do it we shake hand on it we plan ahead only one step a rendezvous for tomorrow when we could swap note i d tell he everything i d learn about seaton s habit and habitat and he d tell i the score on radic we make the date for two oclock in the afternoon at maxine well s pad charlie would get there early because he have the key from here on in the less charlie and i be see together in public or visit one another s room the good i be dead tire and sleep soundly a far a i know dreamlessly we meet at maxine s and decide we be set to stay a long a it take into or even through the even to talk thing out charlie have bring food and we d decide on no drink i d bring along the virgin pint from last night but we be go to kill that only when we be through talk i talk first tell he everything i know about seaton and he house and domestic arrangement i draw diagram and floor plan he memorize they thoroughly and then we tear they into tiny piece and flush they down he give i equivalent and even more detail dope on radic include diagram one of the apartment build radic live in and one of the apartment itself he d be there several time back when while he and radic have be friend or at least not enemy it do nt take we a long a we d think it might it be not quite six oclock when we finish and charlie say well i guess that s it shall we flip a coin to see which of we go first or would you rather deal a hand of show-down poker or play a game of gin rummy or what wait a minute charlie i say one thing we have nt discuss expense money we ll need some at least if only bus fare to the scene of the crime and if you re a flat break a i be i think we ll have to take the add risk of knock over a fill station or something before we split for one of we to set up an alibi while the other do he dirty work he sigh all right i ll come clean i ve get a little stash for a rainy day and i guess this be rainy enough a couple of hundred if you draw the short straw i ll lend you some bread like fifty buck before i take off to visit i sister in frisco then after i m back another fifty so you can put some mileage on yourself and have a solid alibi somewhere while i take care of you seat cover boy solid i say i take a deep breath and the plunge in that case let s not draw i ll go to bat first you d have to wait till seaton s back from mexico city and also while i set it up with doris to have she have an alibi for d-night so it would nt be for day or even a week before you could do anything but you friend manny can go any time he grin and clap i on the shoulder i be hope you d say that willy but i would nt have suggest it well in that case i take off tomorrow morning for frisco and in case i bring the money with i
