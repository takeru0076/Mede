the new structure that for support the basic program of vocational rehabilitation service be describe in this section subsequent section on grant describe the other category of the grant structure the follow table show for select year the authorization appropriation allotment base federal grant to state and state match fund for this part of the grant program method of distribute fund description of formula in order to assist the state in maintain basic vocational rehabilitation service section 2 of the amend act provide that allotment to state for support of such service be base on 1 need a measure by a state s population and 2 fiscal capacity a measure by it per capita income the act far provide for a floor or minimum allotment set at the 1954 level which be call the base allotment and a ceiling or maximum allotment for each state it stipulate in addition that all amount remain a a result of impose the ceiling and not use for insure the floor be redistribute to those state still below they maximum these provision be design to reflect the difference in wealth and population among the state with the objective that a vocationally handicap person have access to need service regardless of whether he reside in a state with a low or high per capita income or a sparsely or thickly populate state the provision be also design to avoid disruption in state program already in operation which might otherwise result from the allotment of fund on the basis of wealth and population alone method of compute allotment the method use in compute the allotment be specifically set forth in the act the term state mean the several state the district of columbia the virgin island guam and puerto rico the term unite state include the several state and the district of columbia and exclude the virgin island guam and puerto rico and prior to 1962 alaska and hawaii the follow step be employ in calculation 1 for each state except puerto rico guam the virgin island and prior to 1962 alaska and hawaii determine average per capita income base on the last three year see source of data below for per capita income data to be use in this step 2 determine the average per capita income for the we base on the last three year see source of data below for per capita income data to be use in this step 3 determine the ratio of 50 % to the average per capita income of the u s divide 50 by the result obtain in item 2 above 4 determine for each state except the virgin island guam and puerto rico and prior to 1962 alaska and hawaii that percentage which bear the same ratio to 50 % a the particular state s average per capita income bear to the average per capita income of the u s multiply the result obtain in item 3 above by the result obtain for each state in item 1 above 5 determine the particular state s allotment percentage by law this be 75 % for the virgin island guam and puerto rico alaska and hawaii have fix allotment percentage in effect prior to fiscal year 1962 in all other state it be the difference obtain by subtract from 100 the result obtain in item 4 above except that no state shall have an allotment percentage less than 33-13 % nor more than 75 % if the result difference for the particular state be less or more than these extreme the state s allotment percentage must be raise or lower to the appropriate extreme 6 square each state s allotment percentage 7 determine each state s population see source of data below for population data to be use in this step 8 multiply the population of each state by the square of it allotment percentage multiply result obtain in item 7 above by result obtain in item 6 above 9 determine the sum of the product obtain in item 8 above for all the state for each state make all computation set forth in item 1 to 8 above and then add the result obtain for each state in item 8 10 determine the ratio that the amount be allot be to the sum of the product for all the state divide the amount be allot by the result obtain in item 9 above 11 determine the particular state s unadjusted allotment for the particular fiscal year multiply the state product in item 8 above by the result obtain in item 10 above 12 determine if the particular state s unadjusted allotment result obtain in item 11 above be great than it maximum allotment and if so low it unadjusted allotment to it maximum allotment each state s unadjusted allotment for any fiscal year which exceed it minimum allotment describe in item 13 below by a percentage great than one and one-half time the percentage by which the sum be allot exceed $ 23000000 must be reduce by the amount of the excess 13 determine if the particular state s unadjusted allotment result obtain in item 11 above be less than it minimum base allotment and if so raise it unadjusted allotment to it minimum allotment regardless of it unadjusted allotment each state be guarantee by law a minimum allotment each year equal to the allotment which it receive in fiscal year 1954 increase by a uniform percentage of 54865771 which bring total 1954 allotment to all state up to $ 23000000 14 the fund recoup by reduction in item 12 above be use first to increase the unadjusted allotment to the specify minimum in those state where the unadjusted allotment be less than the minimum allotment item 13 above and second to increase uniformly the allotment to those state whose allotment be below they maximum with adjustment to prevent the allotment of any state from thereby exceed it maximum additional note on allotment for the state which maintain two separate agency one for the vocational rehabilitation of the blind and one for the rehabilitation of person other than the blind the act specify that they minimum base allotment shall be divide between the two agency in the same proportion a it be divide in fiscal year 1954 fund allot in addition to they minimum allotment be apportion to the two agency a they may determine match requirement explanation of match formula a be the case with the allotment provision for support of vocational rehabilitation service the match requirement be also base on a statutory formula prior to 1960 in order to provide match for the minimum base allotment state fund have to equal 1954 state fund prior to and since 1960 the rest of the support allotment be match at rate relate to the fiscal capacity of the state with a pivot of 40 % state or 60 % federal participation in total program cost the percentage of federal participation in such cost for any state be refer to in the law a that state s federal share for purpose of this explanation this percentage be refer to a the state s unadjusted federal share begin in 1960 the match requirement for the base allotment be be adjust upward or downward a require 25 % a year so that by 1963 the entire support allotment will be match on the basis of a 40 % pivot state share with maximum and minimum state share of 50 % and 30 % respectively the pre-1960 rate of federal participation with respect to any state s base allotment a well a the adjust rate in effect during the 1960 - 1962 period be designate by the statute a that state s adjust federal share the provision for determine a state s unadjusted federal share be design to reflect the vary financial resource among the state the purpose of the adjust federal share relate to the base allotment and of the transition provision for reach the unadjusted federal share be to prevent dislocation from abrupt change in match rate method of compute federal share the method use for compute the respective federal and state share in total program cost be specifically set forth in the act the term state mean the several state the district of columbia the virgin island guam and puerto rico the term unite state include the several state and the district of columbia and exclude the virgin island guam and puerto rico and prior to 1962 alaska and hawaii the follow step be employ in the calculation 1 for each state except the virgin island guam puerto rico and prior to 1962 alaska and hawaii determine the average per capita income for the last three year the same amount use in item 1 under method of compute allotment above 2 determine the average per capita income for the unite state for the last three year the same amount use in item 2 under method of compute allotment above 3 determine the ratio of 40 % to the average per capita income of the unite state divide 40 by the amount use in item 2 above 4 determine for each state except the virgin island guam puerto rico and prior to 1962 alaska and hawaii that percentage which bear the same ration to 40 % a the particular state s average per capita income bear to the average per capita income of the unite state multiply the result obtain in item 3 above by the amount use for each state in item 1 above 5 determine the particular state s federal share by law this be 70 % for the virgin island guam and puerto rico alaska and hawaii have fix federal share percentage in effect prior to fiscal year 1962 in all other state it be the difference obtain by subtract from 100 the result obtain in item 4 above except that no state shall have a federal share less than 50 % nor more than 70 % if the result difference for the particular state be less or more than these extreme the state s federal share must be raise or lower to the appropriate extreme
