analysis analysis mean the evaluation of subparts the comparative rating of part the comprehension of the mean of isolate element analysis in roleplaying be usually do for the purpose of understand strong and weak point of an individual or a a process to eliminate weak part and strengthen good part impersonal purpose up to this point stress have be place on roleplaying in term of individual roleplaying can be do for quite a different purpose to evaluate procedure regardless of individual for example a sales presentation can be analyze and evaluate through roleplaying example let we now put some flesh on the theoretical bone we have assemble by give illustration of roleplaying use for evaluation and analysis one should keep in mind that many of the exciting possiblity of roleplaying be largely unexplored and have not be use in industry to the extent that they have be in military and other area evaluation the president of a small firm sell restaurant product have considerable difficulty in find suitable salesman for he business interview check reference train the salesman have they go with more experience salesman be expensive and the rate of attrition due to resignation or unsatisfactory performance be too high it be he experience that only one good salesman be find out of every seven hire and only one be hire out of every seven interview roleplaying be offer a a solution and the procedure work a follow all candidate be invite to a hotel conference room where the president explain the difficulty he have and how unnecessary it seem to he to hire people who just do not work out in place of ask salesman to fill questionnaire check they reference interview they ask they to be try out he tell they he would prefer to test they each person be to enter the test room carry a suitcase of sample each salesman be to read a sheet contain a description of the product in the test room he be to make successively three presentation to three different people in the test room three of the veteran salesman serve a antagonist one handle the salesman in a friendly manner another in a rough manner and the third in a hesitate manner each be tell to purchase material if he feel like it the antagonist come in one at a time and do not see or hear the other presentation after each presentation the antagonist write he judgment of the salesman and so do the observer consist of the president three of he salesman and a psychologist ten salesman be test in the morning and ten more in the afternoon this procedure be repeat one day a month for four month the bat average of one success out of seven increase to one out of three the president of the firm calculate expense alone feel he cost have drop one-half while success in selection have improve over one hundred per cent the reason for the value of this procedure be simply that the applicant be test at work in different situation by the judgment of a number of expert who could see how the salesman conduct themselves with different but typical restaurant owner and manager they be in a sense try out in realistic situation from the point of view of the applicant less time be waste in be evaluate and they get a meal out of it a well a some insight into they performance another use of roleplaying for evaluation illustrate how this procedure can be use in real life situation without special equipment or special assistant during the daily course of work the position of receptionist be open in a large office and an announcement be make to the other girl already work that they could apply for this job which have high prestige and slightly high salary than type and clerk position all applicant be generally familiar with the work of the receptionist at the end of work one day the personnel man take the applicant one at a time ask they to sit behind the receptionist s desk and he then play the role of a number of people who might come to the receptionist with a number of query and for a number of purpose each girl be independently test by the personnel man and he serve not only a the director but a the antagonist and the observer somewhat to he surprise he find that one girl whom he would never have consider for the job since she have appear somewhat mousy and also have be in the office a relatively short time do the most outstanding job of play the role of receptionist show wit sparkle and aplomb she be hire and be find to be entirely satisfactory when she play the role eight hour a day analysis in consider roleplaying for analysis we enter a more complex area since we be now no long deal with a simple over-all decision but rather with the examination and evaluation of many element see in dynamic function some case in evidence of the use of roleplaying for analysis may help explain the procedure an engineer have be make the work manager of a firm supplant a retire employee who have be consider outstandingly successful the engineer have more than seven year of experience in the firm be well train be consider a hard worker be respect by he fellow engineer for he technical competence and be regard a a comer however he turn out to be a complete failure in he new position he seem to antagonize everyone turnover rate of personnel go up production drop and morale be visibly reduce despite the fact that he be regard a an outstanding engineer he seem to be a very poor administrator although no one quite know what be wrong with he at the insistence of he own supervisor the president of the firm he enrol in a course design to develop leader he play a number of typical situation before observer other supervisor who keep note and then explain to he in detail what he do they think be wrong entirely concern with efficiency he be merciless in criticize people who make mistake condemn they to too great an extent he do not really listen to other have little interest in they idea and want to have he own way which be the only right way the entire group of manager explain in great detail a number of human relation error that he make one by one these error be discuss and one by one he reject accept they a error he admit he behavior and defend it he refuse to change he approach and instead he attack high and low the official for they not back he and subordinate for they laxness stupidity and stubbornness after the diagnose he leave the course convince that it could do he no good we may say that he problem be diagnose but that he refuse treatment the engineer turn work manager have a particular view of life and refuse to change it we may say that he attitude be foolish since he may have be a success have he learn some human relation skill or we may say that he attitude be commendable show he independence of mind in he refusal to adjust to the opinion of other in any case he refuse to accept the implication of the analysis that he need to be make over another case may be give in illustration of a successful use of analysis and also of the employment of a procedure for intensive analysis in a course for supermarket operator a district manager who have be recently appoint to he position after be outstandingly successful a a store manager find that in supervise other manager he be have a difficult time on play some typical situation before a jury of he peer he show some characteristic rate a unsatisfactory he be tell he display for example a sense of superiority and he answer well i be suppose to know all the answer be nt i he be criticize for he curtness and abruptness and he answer i be not work to become popular on be criticize for he arbitrary behavior he answer i have to make decision that s i job in short a frequently happen in analysis the individual feel threaten and defend himself however in this case the district manager be lead to see the error of he way the necessary step between diagnosis and train be acceptance of the validity of the criticism how this be accomplish may be describe since this sometimes be a crucial problem the director help tailor-make a check list of the district manager s error by ask various observer to write out sentence comment on the mistake they feel he make these error be then collect and write on a blackboard condense similar idea eighteen error be locate and then the director ask each individual to vote whether or not they feel that this manager have make the particular error they be ask to vote true if they think they have see he make the error false if they think he have not and can not say if they be not certain the manager sit behind the group so he could see and count the hand that go up and the director write the number on the blackboard no comment be make during the vote the result look a follow afj the first eight of these eighteen statement which receive at least one-half of the vote be duplicate to form an analysis checklist for the particular manager and when this particular manager roleplay in other situation the member check any item that appear to prevent the manager from deliberately control himself only during the session they be rather lengthy about twenty minute the situation be imperfectly describe to the manager so that he would not know what to expect new antagonist be bring on the scene unexpectedly and the antagonist be instruct to deliberately behave in such way a to upset the manager and get he to operate in a manner for which he have be previously criticize after every session the check mark be totale up and graph and in this way the supervisor s progress be chart summary in life we learn to play we role and we freeze into pattern which become so habitual that we be not really aware of what we do we can see other more clearly than we can see ourselves and other can see we good than we see ourselves to learn what we do be the first step for improvement to accept the validity of the judgment of other be the second step to want to change be the third step to practice new procedure under guide supervision and with constant feedback be the fourth step to use these new way in daily life be the last step roleplaying use for analysis follow these general step lead to train when an evaluative situation be set up and no concern be with the detail that lead to an over-all estimate we say that roleplaying be use for evaluation observer can see a person engage in spontaneous behavior and watch he operate in a totalistic fashion this behavior be more veridical or true than other test behavior for some type of evaluation and so can give quick and accurate estimate of complex function while roleplaying for test be not too well understand at the present time it represent one of the major use of this procedure chapter 10 spontaneity train the objective of this chapter be to clarify the distinction between spontaneity theory and other train concept in addition the basic approach utilize in apply roleplaying will be review the goal will be to provide the reader with an integrate rationale to aid he in apply roleplaying technique in this unique train area the reason for extract this particular roleplaying application from the previous discussion of train be twofold 1 spontaneity train theory be unique and relatively new
