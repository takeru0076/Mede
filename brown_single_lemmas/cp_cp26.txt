i be think of the heat and of water that morning when i be plow the stubble field far across the hill from the farm building it have grow hot early that day and i hope that the boy i brother s son would soon come across the broad black area of plow ground carry the jar of cool water the boy usually be send out at about that time with the water and he always drag an old snow-fence lath or a stick along to play with he pretend that the lath be a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buz tractor sound with he lip i almost run over the snake before i could stop the tractor in time i have turn at the corner of the field and i have to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into the earth and i be think of the boy and the water anyway and when i look again down the furrow the snake be there it lie half in the furrow and half out and the front wheel have roll nearly up to it when i put in the clutch the tractor be heavily load with the weight of the plow turn the earth and the tractor stop instantly the snake slide slowly and with great care from the new ridge the plow have make into the furrow and do not go any far i have never like snake much i still have that kind of quick panic that i d have a a child whenever i see one but this snake be clean and bright and very beautiful he be multi-colored and graceful and he lie in the furrow and move he arch and taper head only so slightly go out of the furrow snake i say but it do not move at all i pull the throttle of the tractor in and out hope to frighten he with the noise but the snake only flick it black fork tongue and face the huge tractor wheel without fright or concern i let the engine idle then and i get down and go around the wheel and stand beside it i movement do frighten the snake and it raise it head and trail delicately a couple of foot and stop again and it tongue be work very rapidly i follow it look at the brilliant color on it tubular back the color clear and sharp and perfect in orange and green and word diamond the size of a baby s fist down it back and the diamond be set one within the other and interlace with glisten jet-black the color be astonish clear and bright and it be a if the body hold a fire of it own and the color come through that transparent flesh and skin vivid and alive and warm the eye be clear and black and the slender body be arch slightly he flat and gracefully taper head lift a i look at he and the black tongue slip in and out of that solemn mouth you beauty i say i could nt kill you you be much too beautiful i have kill snake before when i be young but there have be no animal like this one and i know it be unthinkable that an animal such a that should die i pick he up and the length of he arch very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly and i could feel the coolness of that radiant fire-colored body like splendid ice and i know that he have eat only recently because there be two whole and solid little lump in the forepart of he like fieldmice swallow whole might make the body caress through i hand like cool satin and i hand usually tan and dark be pale beside it and i ask it where the fire color could come from the coolness of that body i lower he so he would not fall and he body slide out onto the cool newly-plowed earth from between i pale hand the snake work away very slowly and delicately and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty and he carry he head a little above the roll clod the sharp burn color of he body stand brilliant and plain against the black soil like a target i feel good and satisfy look at the snake it shine in it bright diamond color against the sun-burned stubble and the crumble black clod of soil and against the paleness of myself the color and beauty of it be strange and wonderful and somehow alien too in that dry and dusty and uncolored field i get on the tractor again and i have to watch the plow closely because the field be draw across the long hillside and even in that good soil there be a danger of rock i have i back to the corner of the triangular field that point towards the house the earth be a little heavy and i have to stop once and clean the plowshares because they be not scour properly and i do not look back towards the place until i have turn the corner and be plow across the upper line of the large field a long way from where i have stop because of the snake i see it all at a glance the boy be there at the low corner of the field and he be in the plow earth stamp with ferocity and a kind of frenzy impatience even at that distance with no sound but the sound of the tractor i could tell the fierce mark of brutality on the boy i could see the hunched-up shoulder the savage determination the dance of he foot a he ground the snake with he heel and the pirouette of he arm a he whip at it with the stick stop it i shout but the lumber and mighty tractor roar on above anything i could say i stop the tractor and i shout down to the boy and i know he could hear i for the morning be clear and still but he do not even hesitate in that brutal murder dance it be no use i feel myself tremble think of the diamond light of that beauty i have hold a few moment before and i want to run down there and halt if i could that frenetic pirouette catch the boy in the moment of he savagery and save a glimmer a remnant of that which i remember but i know it be already too late i drive the tractor on not look down there i be afraid to look for fear the evil might still be go on i head begin to ache and the fume of the tractor begin to bother i eye and i hate the job suddenly and i think there be only moment when one see beautiful thing and these be soon crush or they vanish i feel the anger mount within i the boy wait at the corner with the jar of water hold up to i in he hand and the water have grow bubbly in the heat of the morning i know the boy well he be eleven and we have do many thing together he be a beautiful boy really with finely-spun blonde hair and a smooth and still effeminate face and he eyelash be long and dark and brushlike and he eye be blue he wait there and he smile a the tractor come up a he would smile on any other day he be i nephew i brother s son handsome and warm and newly-scrubbed with happiness upon he face and he face resemble i brother s and i a well i see then too the stake drive straight and hard into the plow soil through something there where i have be not long before i stop the tractor and climb down and the boy come eagerly up to i can i ride around with you he ask a he often do and i have a often let he be on the tractor beside i i look closely at he eye and he be already innocent the kill be already forget in that clear mind of he no you can not i say push aside the water jar he offer to i i point to the splinter upright stake do you do that i ask yes he say eagerly begin a kind of dance of excitement i kill a snake it be a big one he try to take i hand to show i why do you kill it snake be ugly and bad this snake be very beautiful do nt you see how beautiful it be snake be ugly he say again you see the color of it do nt you have you ever see anything like it around here snake be ugly and bad and it might have bitten somebody and they would have die you know there be no poisonous snake in this area this snake could not harm anything they eat chicken sometimes the boy say they be ugly and they eat chicken and i hate snake you be talk foolishly i say you kill it because you want to kill it for no other reason they re ugly and i hate they the boy insist nobody like snake it be beautiful i say half to myself the boy skip along beside i and he be content with what he have do the fire of the color be go there be a contort ugliness now the color of it back be dull and gray-looking tear and smash in and dirty from the boy s shoe the beautifully-tapered head so delicate and so cool have be flatten a if in a vise and the fork tongue splay out of the twist tear mouth the snake be hideous and i remember even then the cool bright fire of it only a little while before and i think perhaps the boy have always see it dead and hideous like that and have not even stop to see the beauty of it in it life i wrench the stake out that the boy have drive through it in the thick part of it body between the colore diamond crystal i touch it and the coolness the ice-feeling be go and even then it move a little perhaps a tiny spasm of the dead muscle and i hope that it be truly dead so that i would not have to kill it and then it move a little more and i know the snake be die and i would have to kill it there the boy stand off a few foot and he have the stake again and he be race innocently in circle make the buz tractor sound with he lip i m sorry i think to the snake for you be beautiful i take the break length of it around the tractor and i take one of the wrench from the tool-kit and i strike it head not look at it to kill it at last for it could never live the boy come around behind i drag the stake it s a big snake be nt it he say i m go to tell everybody how big a snake i kill do nt you see what you have do i say do nt you see the difference now it s an ugly terrible snake he say he come up and be go to push at it with he heavy shoe i could see the happiness in the boy s eye the gleeful brutality do nt i say i could have slap the boy he look up at i puzzle and he sway he head from side to side i think you little brute you nasty selfish little beast with brutality already develop within that brain and in those eye i want to slap he face to wipe forever the insolence and brutal glee from he mouth and i decide then very suddenly what i would do
