some of the new york philharmonic musician who live in the suburb spend yesterday morning dig themselves free from snow a tiny handful never do make the concert but after a fifteen-minute delay the substantially complete philharmonic assemble on stage for the afternoon s proceeding they face a rather small audience a quite a few subscriber apparently have decide to forego the pleasure of the afternoon it be an excellent concert paul paray round out he current stint with the orchestra be a solid musician and the philharmonic play for he they collaboration in the beethoven second symphony be lucid intelligent and natural sound it be not a heavy ponderous beethoven the music sing nicely sprint evenly when necessary be properly accent and balance the franck symphonic poem psyche be a lush sweet-sounding affair that be pleasant to encounter once again fortunate for the music itself it be not too frequent a visitor if it be it heavily chromatic harmony would soon become cloy mr paray resist the temptation to over-emphasize the melodic element of the score he do not let the string for instance weep whine or get hysterical he interpretation be a model of refinement and accuracy and in the prokofieff c major piano concerto with zadel skolovsky a soloist he be an admirable partner mr skolovsky s approach to the concerto be bold sweep and tonally percussive he sweep through the music with ease in a non-sentimental and ultra-efficient manner an impressive technician mr skolovsky have fine rhythm to boot he tone be the weak part of he equipment it tend to be hard and colorless a school of think have it that those attribute be exactly what this concerto need it be after all a non-romantic work even with the big juicy melody of the second movement and the composer himself be call the age of steel pianist but grant all this one still would have like to have hear a little more tonal nuance than mr skolovsky supply take a a whole though it be a strong performance from both pianist and orchestra mr skolovsky fully deserve the warm reception he receive a new work on the program be nikolai lopatnikoff s festival overture receive it first new york hear this be compose last year a a salute to the automobile industry it be not program music though it run a little more than ten minute be workmanlike busy methodical and featureless la gioconda like it or not be a singer s opera and so of course it be a fan s opera a well snow or no the fan be present in force at the metropolitan opera last night for a performance of the ponchielli work so the plot creak the set be decay the costume be pre-historic the orchestra be sloppy and not very well connect with what the singer be do after all the opera have juicy music to sing and the goody be well distribute with no less than six lead part one of those part be that of evil evil barnaba the spy he wicked deed be carry on by anselmo colzani who be take the part for the first time with the company he have the temperament and the stage presence for a rouse villain and he sing with character and strong tone what be lack be a real sense of phrase the kind of legato sing that would have add a dimension of smoothness to what be after all a very oily character regina resnik a laura and cesare siepi a alvise also be new to the cast but only with respect to this season they have both sing these part here before laura be a good role for miss resnik and she give it force dramatic color and passion mr siepi be a always a consummate actor with a few tell stroke he characterize alvise magnificently part of this characterization be of course accomplish with the vocal chord he sing be strong and musical unfortunately he voice be out of focus and often spread in quality eileen farrell in the title role mignon dunn a la cieca and richard tucker a enzo be holdovers from early performance this season and all contribute to a vigorous performance if only they and fausto cleva in the pit have get together a bit more melodious bird sing madrigal saith the poet and no good description of the madrigaling of the deller consort could be imagine they vanguard album madrigal masterpiece bg 609 stereo bgs 5031 be a good sample of the special elegant art of english madrigal sing it also make a fine introduction to the international art form with good example of italian and english madrigal plus several french chanson the english have manage to hold onto they madrigal tradition good than anyone else the original impulse come to england late in the sixteenth century and continue strong long after everyone else have go on to the baroque basso continuo sonata opera and the like even after elizabethan tradition be weaken by the cromwellian interregnum the practice of sing together chorus catch and glee always flourish the english never again develop a strong native music that could obliterate the trace of an early great age the way say the opera in italy blot out the italian madrigal early interest latter-day interest in elizabethan sing date well back into the nineteenth century in england much ahead of similar revival in other country a a result no comparable literature of the period be good know and good study nor more often perform than the english madrigal naturally mr deller and the other singer in he troupe be most charm and elegant when they be squarely in they tradition and sing music by they countryman william byrd thoma morley and thoma tomkins there be an almost instrumental quality to they sing with a tendency to lift out important line and make they lead the musical texture both technique give the music purity and clarity claude jannequin s vocal description of a battle the french equivalent of tarantara rum-tum-tum and boom-boom-boom be very picturesque be lot of fun and the singer get a sense of grace and shape into other chanson by jannequin and lassus only with the more sensual intense and baroque expression of marenzio monteverdi and gesualdo do the sing seem a little superficial nevertheless the musicality accuracy and infectious charm of these performance excellently reproduce make it an attractive look-see at the period the work be present chronologically text and translation be provide elegance and color the element of elegance and color in jannequin be strong french characteristic baroque instrumental music in italy and germany tend to be strong lively intense control and quite abstract in france it remain always more picturesque more dancelike more full of flavor couperin and rameau give title to nearly everything they write not in the late sense of program music but a a kind of nonmusical reference for the close clear musical form fill with keen wit and precise utterance both composer turn up on new import from france bam be the unlikely name of a french record company whose full label be edition de la boite a musique they specialize in out-of-the-way item and old french music naturally occupy a good deal of they attention sonates et concert royaux of couperin le grand occupy two disk ld056 and ld060 and reveal the impeccable taste and workmanship of this master delicate flexible and gemlike the concert no 2 6 9 10 and 14 be represent be really close to chamber suite than to concerto in the italian sense the sonata la francaise la sultane lastree and limperiale be often more elaborately work out and in fact show a strong italian influence couperin also turn up along with some lesser-known contemporary on a disk call musique francaise do 18e siecle bam ld 060 jean-marie leclair still be remember a bit but bodin de beismortier corrette and mondonville be hardly household word what be interest about these chamber work here be how they all reveal the aspect of french music that be move toward the rococo the couperin la steinkerque with it battle music brevity wit and refine simplicity already shake off corelli and point towards the mid-century elegance that end the baroque era if couperin show the fashionable trend the other do so all the more all these record have close attractive sound and the performance by a variety of instrumentalist be characteristic rameau s six concert en sextuor record by lorchestre de chambre pierre menet bam ld 046 turn out to be harpsichord piece arrange for string apparently by the composer himself the

instrumentalist include anabel brieff flutist josef marx oboist and robert conant pianist and harpsichordist since rococo music tend to be pretty and elegant above all it can seem rather vacuous to twentieth-century ear that have grow accustom to the stress and dissonance of composer from beethoven to boulez thus there be really an excess of eighteenth-century charm a one of these light-weight piece follow another on saturday night each might find a useful place in a vary musical program but take together they grow quite tiresome the performance be variable those of the full ensemble be generally satisfy some by soloist prove rather try ellie mao soprano and frederick full baritone present a program of folksong entitle east meet west in carnegie recital hall last night they be accompany by anna mi lee pianist selection from fifteen country be sing a solo and duet in a broad range of language song from china and japan be reserve exclusively for miss mao who be a native of china and those of the british isle be sing by mr full who be english by birth this be not a program intend to illustrate authentic folk style on the contrary miss mao and mr full choose many of they arrangement from the work of composer such a mendelssohn dvorak canteloube copland and britten there be therefore more musical substance in the concert than might have be the case otherwise the
