to what extent and in what way do christianity affect the unite state of america in the nineteenth century how far and in what fashion do it modify the new nation which be emerge in the midst of the force shape the revolutionary age to what extent do it mould the moral and the social economic and political life and institution of the country a complete picture be impossible partly because of the limitation of space partly because for millions of individual who profess allegiance to the christian faith data be unobtainable even more of an obstacle be the difficulty of separate the influence of christianity from other factor although a complete picture can not be give we can indicate some aspect of life into which the christian faith enter a at least one creative factor at time we can say that it be the major factor what in some way be the most important aspect be the impact individually on the millions who constitute the nation a we have see a grow proportion although in 1914 still a minority be member of church presumably those who do not have a formal church connexion have also feel the influence of christianity to a great or lesser extent many of they have once be member of a church or at least have be give instruction in christianity but for one or another reason have allow the connexion to lapse the form of christianity to which they be expose be for some the protestantism of the old stock for other the protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration for still other mostly of the nineteenth-century immigration it be roman catholicism and for a small minority it be eastern orthodoxy upon all of they play the intellectual social political and economic attitude institution and custom of the nation upon most of these christianity have leave an impress and through they have have a share in make the individual what he be yet to determine precisely to what extent and exactly in what way any individual show the effect of christianity would be impossible at good only an approximation could be arrive at to generalize for the entire nation would be absurd for instance we can not know whether even for church member the degree of conformity to christian standard of morality increase or decline a the proportion of church member in the population rise the temptation be to say that a the percentage of church member mount the degree of discipline exercise by the church lessen and the trend be towards conformity to the general level yet this can not be prove we know that in the early part of the century many protestant congregation take positive action against member who transgress the ethical code to which the majority subscribe thus baptist church on the frontier take cognizance of charge against they member of drunkenness fight malicious gossip lie cheat sexual irregularity gamble horse race and failure to pay just debt if guilty the offender might be exclude from membership a church membership burgeon such measure fade into desuetude but whether this be accompany by a general lower of the moral life of the membership we do not know what we can attempt with some hope of dependable conclusion be to point out the manner in which christianity enter into particular aspect of the life of the nation we have already hint at the fashion in which christianity contribute to education and so to intellectual life we will now speak of the way in which it help shape the ideal of the country and of the manner in which it stimulate effort to attain those ideal through reform movement through programme for bring the collective life to the nation to conformity to christian standard and through leader in the government throughout the nineteenth century christianity exert it influence on american society a a whole primarily through the protestantism of the old stock by the end of the century the roman catholic church be begin to make itself feel mainly through such institution a hospital but also through it attitude towards organize labour in the twentieth century it influence grow a do that of the protestantism of the nineteenth-century immigration the american dream the ideal of the country be deeply indebted to the protestantism of the old stock thus america the most widely sing of the patriotic song be write by a new england baptist clergyman samuel francis smith 1808-1895 while a student in andover theological seminary with it zeal for liberty and it dependence on god it breathe the spirit which have be nourish on the evangelical revival the great seal of the unite state be obviously inspire by the christian faith here be what be call the american dream namely the effort to build a structure which would be something new in history and to do so in such fashion that god could bless it late in the century the dream again find expression in the line of katherine lee bate 1859-1929 daughter and granddaughter of new england congregational minister in she widely sing hymn write in 1893 america the beautiful with the word o beautiful for pilgrim foot whose stern impassioned stress a thoroughfare for freedom beat across the wilderness america america god mend thou every flaw confirm thou soul in self control the liberty in law o beautiful for patriot dream that see beyond the year thou alabaster city gleam undimmed by human tear america america god shed he grace on thou and crown thou good with brotherhood from sea to shine sea the american dream be compound of many strain some be clearly of christian origin among they the great awaken and other revival which help to make christian liberty christian equality and christian fraternity the passion of the land some have see revivalism and the search for christian perfection a the fountain-head of the american hope here too must be place unitarianism and less obviously from christian inspiration emerson transcendentalism and the idealism of walt whitman we must also remember those who react against the dream a a kind of myth among they melville hawthorne and henry jame the elder all of they out of a christian background reform movement with such a dream arise at least in part from the protestant heritage of the unite state and build into the foundation of the nation it be not surprise that many effort be make to give it concrete expression a number be in the nature of movement to relieve or remove social ill significantly the initiation and leadership of a major proportion of the reform movement especially those in the first half of the nineteenth century come from man and woman of new england birth or parentage and from either trinitarian or unitarian congregationalism several of the movement be give a mark impetus by revivalism quaker some from new england have a large share than they proportionate numerical strength would have warrant we do well to remind ourselves that from man and woman of new england ancestry also issue the church of jesus christ of latter day saint the seventh day adventist christian science the american board of commissioner for foreign mission the american home missionary society the american bible society and new england theology the atmosphere be one of optimism of confidence in human progress and of a determination to rid the world of it ill the hopkinsian universal disinterested benevolence although hold to original sin and the doctrine of election inspire it adherent to heroic endeavour for other look for the early come of the millennium and be paralleled by the confidence in man s ability cherish by the unitarian emerson and the transcendentalist we should recall the number of movement for the service of mankind which arise from the kindred evangelicalism of the british isle and the pietism of the continent of europe among they prison reform anti-slavery measure legislation for the alleviation of condition of labour the inner mission and the red cross we can not take the space to record all the effort for the removal or alleviation of collective ill a few of the more prominent must serve a example of what a complete list and description would disclose several be bear in the early decade and persist throughout the century other be ephemeral some disappear with the attainment of they purpose still other spring up late in the century to meet condition which arise from fresh stage of the revolutionary age the anti-slavery movement the movement to end negro slavery begin before 1815 and mount after that year until a a result of the civil war emancipation be achieve long before 1815 the christian conscience be lead some to declare slavery wrong and to act accordingly for example in 1693 the philadelphia yearly meet of friend declare that it member should emancipate they slave and in 1776 it determine to exclude from membership all who do not comply in the latter year samuel hopkins from whom the hopkinsian strain of new england theology take it name ask the continental congress to abolish slavery a we have see methodism early take a stand against slavery begin at least a far back a 1789 various baptist body condemn slavery after 1815 anti-slavery sentiment mount chiefly among protestant and those of protestant background of the old stock the nineteenth-century immigration whether protestant or roman catholic be not so much concern for very few if any among they hold slave they be mostly in the northern state where slavery have disappear or be on the way out or be too poverty-stricken to own slave the anti-slavery movement take many form benjamin lundy 1789-1839 a quaker be a pioneer in prepare the way for anti-slavery society it be he who turn the attention of william lloyd garrison 1805-1879 to the subject garrison massachusetts bear of nova scotian parentage be by temperament
