after only eighteen year of non-interference there be already indication of melioration though in a slight degree to be sure there be more indication by the mid-twentieth century i leave it to the statistician to say what they be but i notice several a few year ago during an automobile ride from memphis to hattiesburg in town after town i companion point out the negro school and the white school and in every instance the former make a good appearance it be new for one thing it really look a if a change of the sort predict by booker t washington have be go on but with the renewal of interference in 1954 a with it begin in 1835 the improvement be impair for over a hundred year southerner have feel that the north be pick on they it s infuriate this feel that one be be pick on continually constantly by what right of superior virtue southerner ask do the people of the north do this the traditional strategy of the south have be to expose the vice of the north to demonstrate that the north possess no superior virtue to show the world that a jame s christopher newman say to he adversary however bad i may be you re not quite the people to say it in the pre-civil war year the south argue that the slave be not less humanely treat than the factory worker of the north at the present time the counter-attack take the line that there s no more of the true spirit of integration in the north than in the south the line be a pretty good one people talk about the law of the land the expression have become quite a cliche but people can nt be make to integrate socialize the two be inseparable by southern standard by law i be have lunch not long ago apology to nv peale with three distinguish historian one specialize in the european middle age one in american history and one in the far east and i ask they if they could name instance where the general more have be radically change with deliberate speed majestic instancy francis thompson s word for the hound of heaven s pursuit by judicial fiat they do nt seem to be able to think of any a virginia judge a while back cite a roman jurist to the effect that ten year might be a reasonable length of time for such a change but i suspect that the old roman be refer to change make under military occupation the sort of change which tacitus be talk about when he say they make a desert and call it peace solitudinem faciunt pacem appellant moreover the law of the land be not irrevocable it can be change it have be many time mr justice taney s dred scott decision in 1857 be unpopular in the north and soon become a dead letter prohibition be the law of the land but it be unpopular how many of we oldster take up drink in prohibition day drink be so gay so fashionable especially in the sophisticate northeast and be repeal the cliche lose it talismanic virtue in the light of a little history the declaration of independence say that government derive they just power from the consent of the govern the phrase consent of the govern need a hard look how do we define it be the consent of the govern a numerical majority calhoun deal with this question in he disquisition on government to guard against the tyranny of a numerical majority calhoun develop he theory of concurrent majority which he say by give to each portion of the community which may be unequally affect by the action of government a negative on the other prevent all partial or local legislation who will say that we country be even now a homogeneous community that regional peculiarity do not still exist that the court order do not unequally affect the southern region who will deny that in a vast portion of the south the federal action be incompatible with the jeffersonian concept of the consent of the govern circumstance alter case a friend of i in new mexico say the court order have cause no particular trouble out there that all have go a merry a a marriage bell he seem a little surprise that it should have cause any particular trouble anywhere i murmur something about a possible difference between new mexico s history and mississippi s one can meet with aloofness almost anywhere the thidiu viewpoint it do nt affect we southern liberal there be a good many especially if they re rich often exhibit blithe insouciance the trouble here be that it s almost too easy to take the high moral ground when it do nt cost you anything you ve already send you daughter to miss x s select academy for girl and you son to mr y s select academy for boy and you can be a liberal a you please with strict impunity if there s no suitable academy in you own neighborhood there s always new england new england academy welcome fugitive from the province south a well a west they may even enroll a colore student or two for show though he usually turn out to be from thailand or any place other than the american south it would be interest to know how much integration there be in the famous fashionable college and prep school of new england a recent newspaper report say there be five negroes in the 1960 graduate class of nearly one thousand at yale that be about one-half of one per cent which look pretty tokenish to i especially in an institution which profess to be national i must confess that i prefer the liberal who be personally affect who be will to send he own child to a mix school a proof of he faith i leave out of account the question of the good interest of the child the question of what they good interest really be i m talk about the grand manner of the liberal north and south who be not affect personally if these people be deny a voice do they have a moral right to a voice what voice would be leave who be involve willy nilly well after everybody have follow the new england pattern of segregate one s child into private school only the poor folk be leave and it be precisely in this poor economic class that one find and have always find the most racial friction a dear respect friend of i who like myself grow up in the south and have spend many year in new england say to i not long ago i can nt forgive new england for reject all complicity be a teacher of american literature i remember whittier s massachusetts to virginia where he say but that one dark loathsome burden you must stagger with alone and reap the bitter harvest which you yourselves have sow there be a legend hawthorne record it in he english notebook and one find it again in thoma nelson page to the effect that the mayflower on it second voyage bring a cargo of negro slave whether historically a fact or not the legend have a certain symbolic value complicity be an embarrass word it be something which most of we try to get out from under like the cowboy in stephen crane s blue hotel we run around cry well i do nt do anything do i robert penn warren put it this way in brother to dragon the recognition of complicity be the begin of innocence where innocence i think mean about the same thing a redemption a man must be able to say father i have sin or there be no hope for he lincoln understand this good than most when he say in he second inaugural that god give to both north and south this terrible war a the woe due to those by whom the offense come he also speak of the wealth pile by the bondsman s two hundred and fifty year in unrequited toil lincoln be historian and economist enough to know that a substantial portion of this wealth have accumulate in the hand of the descendant of new englanders engage in the slave trade after how many generation be such wealth mount all the while through the manipulation of high finance purify of taint it be a question which new englanders long ago put out of they mind but do nt they get off too easy the slave never share in they profit while they do share in a very real sense in the profit of the slave-owner they be feed clothe doctore and so forth they be the beneficiary of responsible paternalistic care emerson platonist idealist doctrinaire sound a high transcendental note in he boston hymn deliver in 1863 in the boston music hall amidst thunder applause pay ransom to the owner and fill the bag to the brim who be the owner the slave be owner and ever be pay he it be the abstractionism the unrealism of the pure idealist it ignore the sordid financial aspect quite conveniently too for he audience who could indulge in moral indignation without visible or even conscious discomfort they money from the transaction have be put away long ago in a good antiseptic brokerage like pilate they have wash they hand but can one really can god be mock ever in the long run new englanders be a bit sensitive on the subject of they complicity in negro slavery at the time of the draft of the declaration of independence a jefferson explain in he autobiography the clause reprobating the enslave the inhabitant of africa be strike out in complaisance to south carolina and georgia who have never attempt to restrain the importation of slave and who on the contrary still wish to continue it we northern brother also i believe feel a little tender under those censure for though they people have very few slave themselves yet they have be pretty considerable carrier of they to other but that be a long time ago the new england conscience become desensitize george w cable naturalize new englander write in 1889 from paradise road northampton lovely symbolic name agitate continuously the southern question it be nice to be able to isolate it new england a everyone know have long be schoolmaster to the nation there one find concentrate in a comparatively small area the chief university college and preparatory school of the unite state why should this be so it be true that new england more than any other section be dedicate to education from the start but i think that something more than this be involve how do it happen for example that the state university that great symbol of american democracy fail to flourish in new england a it do in other part of the country be nt it a bit odd that the three state of southern new england massachusetts connecticut and rhode island have have state institution of university status only in the very recent past these institution have previously be a & m college be it suppose perchance that a & m vocational train that be be quite sufficient for the immigrant class which flood that part of the new england world in the post-civil war period the immigrant have be bring in from southern europe to work in the mill to make up for the labor shortage cause by migration to the west be it not ironical that roger william s state rhode island should have be the very last of the forty-eight to establish a state university the state university of maine new hampshire and vermont be old and more respectable they have less immigration to contend with a yale historian write a few year ago in the yale review say we in new england have long since segregate we child he be refer not only to the general college situation but more especially to the preparatory school and what a galaxy of those adorn that fair land i do nt propose to go into they history but i have one or two surmise one be that they be establish or gain eminence under pressure provide by these same immigrant from whom the old family wish to segregate they child in the early day of a homogeneous population the public school be quite satisfactory
