when mickey charles mantle the new york yankee man of muscle drive a home run 450 foot into the bleacher he feat touch upon the sublime when roger eugene maris mantle s muscular teammate power four home run in a double-header he performance merit awe but when tiny 145-pound albert gregory pearson of the los angeles angel who once catch three straight fly ball in center field because a a teammate explain the other team think no one be out there hit seven home run in four month three more than he total in 1958 1959 and 1960 he achievement border on the ridiculous this be baseball 1961 this be the year home run range from the sublime to the ridiculous it be the year when 1 amiable jim gentile of the baltimore oriole amble to the plate in consecutive innings with the base load and in unprecedented style deliver consecutive grand-slam home run 2 willie may of the san francisco giant borrow a teammate s bat and become the ninth big leaguer to stroke four home run in a game 3 the milwaukee brave tie a major-league record with fourteen home run in three game and lose two of they and 4 catcher johnny blanchard of the new york yankee match a record with home run in four successive time at bat two of they a a pinch-hitter pitcher grumble about lively ball and lively bat the shrink strike zone and the fact that the knock-down pitch be now illegal expert point to the thin of pitch talent in the american league cause by expansion whatever the reason not in 30 year have a single season produce such thunderous assault upon the bureau of baseball record home-run division of all the record in peril one stand apart dramatic in it make dramatic in it endurance and now doubly dramatic in it jeopardy this of course be baseball s most remarkable mark the 60 home run hit in 1927 by the incorrigible epicure the incredible athlete george herman babe ruth of the yankee since 1927 fewer than a dozen man have make serious run at babe ruth s record and each in turn have be thwart what ultimately frustrate every challenger be ruth s amaze september surge in the final month of the 1927 season he hit seventeen home run a close spurt never match double threat always in the abortive attack upon ruth s record one man alone a jimmy foxx 58 in 1932 or a hank greenberg 58 in 1938 or a hack wilson 56 in 1930 make the bid but now for the first time since lou gehrig with 47 home run spur ruth on in 1927 two man play for the same team have zeroe in on 60 they name be mantle and maris they team be the yankee and they threat be real after 108 game in 1927 ruth have 35 home run after 108 game in 1961 mickey mantle have 43 roger maris 41 extend mantle s and maris s present pace over the full 1961 schedule of 162 game and mathematically each will hit more than 60 home run this be the great edge the two yankee have go for they to good ruth s mark neither need a spectacular september flourish all mantle need be eight more home run in august and ten in september and he will establish a new record in ruth s day and until this year the schedule be 154 game baseball commissioner ford frick have rule that ruth s record will remain official unless it be break in 154 game even on the basis of 154 game this be the ideal situation insist hank greenberg now vice-president of the chicago white sox it have to be easy with two of they how can you walk maris to get to mantle roommate neither mantle nor maris understandably will predict 60 home run for himself although both concede they would like to hit 60 they stick primarily to the baseball player s standard quote the important thing be to win the pennant but one thing be for certain there be no dissension between mantle the american league s most valuable player in 1956 and 1957 and maris the mvp in 1960 each enjoy see the other hit home run i hope roger hit 80 mantle say and each enjoy even more see himself hit home run and i hope i hit 81 the slugger get along so well in fact that with they family at home for the summer mantle s in dallas maris s in kansas city they be room together mantle maris and bob cerv a utility outfielder share an apartment in jamaica long island not far from new york international airport the three pay $ 251 a month for four room kitchen dine room live room and bedroom with air-conditioning and new modern furniture mantle and cerv use the twin bed in the bedroom maris sleep on a green studio couch in the live room they divide up the household chore cerv do most of the cook breakfast and sandwich snack with dinner out mantle supply the transportation a white 1961 oldsmobile convertible and maris drive the 25-minute course from the apartment house to yankee stadium mantle maris and cerv probably share one major-league record already among they they have fifteen child eight for cerv four for mantle and three for maris a roommate teammate and home-run mate mantle 29 who break in with the yankee ten year ago and maris 26 who come to the yankee from kansas city two year ago have strikingly similar background both be scholastic star in football basketball and baseball mantle in commerce okla maris in fargo nd a halfback both come close to play football at the university of oklahoma sometimes in the minor maris recall i wish i have go to oklahoma to an extent the two even look alike both have blue eye and short blond hair both be 6 foot tall and weigh between 195 and 200 pound but mantle incredibly muscular he have a 17-12-inch neck look big with they huge back and overdeveloped shoulder both must have they clothe make to order maris purchase $ 100 suit from simpson s in new york mantle more concern with dress buy he suit four at a time at neiman-marcus in dallas and pay a much a $ 250 each light read neither mantle nor maris need fear be classify an intellectual but lately mantle have show unusual devotion to an intellectual opus henry miller s tropic of cancer mantle so appreciate miller s delicate literary style that he broaden teammate mind by read sensitive passage aloud during road trip mantle be not normally give to public speak or for that matter to private speak what do you and mickey talk about at home a reporter ask maris recently to tell you the truth maris say mickey do nt talk much this be no surprise trait for a ballplayer what be surprise and pleasant be that mantle and maris under constant pressure from writer and photographer be try to be cooperative of the two mantle be by nature the less outgoing maris the more outspoken but last week when a reporter be stand near mantle s locker mickey walk up and volunteer an anecdote see that kid he say point to a dark-haired 11-year-old boy that s yogi berra s i ll never forget one time i strike out three time drop a fly ball and we lose the game i come back sit by i locker feel real low and the kid walk over to i look up and say you stunk maris in talk to reporter try to answer all question candidly and fully but on rare occasion he shun newsman when i ve make a dumb play he say i do nt want to talk to anyone i m angry by he own confession maris be an angry young man bench at tulsa in 1955 he tell manager dutch meyer i can nt play for you send i where i can play meyer send he to read pa bench at indianapolis in 1956 he tell manager kerby farrell i m not learn anything on the bench play i farrell do and maris lead the team to victory in the little world series that s the way i be he say i tell people what i think if you re a good ballplayer you ve get to get mad give i a team of nine angry man and i ll give you a team of nine gentleman and we ll beat you nine out of ten time idol idol one good indication of the two man s personality be the way they react to meet they own hero maris s be ted william when i be a kid maris tell a sportswriter last week i use to follow william every day in the box score just to see whether he get a hit or not when you come up to the major do you seek out william for advice be you kid say maris you re afraid to talk to a guy you idolize mantle s hero be joe dimaggio when mickey go to the yankee say mark freeman an ex-yankee pitcher who sell mutual fund in denver dimaggio still be play and every day mickey would go by he locker just ache for some word of encouragement from this great man this hero of he but dimaggio never say a word it crush mickey he tell i he vow right then that if he ever get to be a star this never would be say of he mantle have keep the vow among all the yankee he be the veteran most friendly to rooky neither mantle nor maris be totally devote to baseball above all else if lay tie on a railroad track which he once do for $ 1 an hour pay more than play right field for the yankee maris would lie tie on a railroad track if work in a zinc i which he once do for 87-12 cent an hour pay more than play center field for the yankee mantle would work in a zinc i but since railroad and mine be not the high pay art mantle and maris concentrate on baseball they try to play baseball the good they can each be a complete ballplayer mantle beyond any question can do more thing well one of the reason they get along fine say a sportswriter who be friendly with the two man be that both realize mantle be head-and-shoulder above maris hit mantle have an immediate advantage because he bat both left-handed and right-handed maris only left-handed they both possess near classic stance dig in firmly arm high set for fierce swing mantle be considerably good hit for average fourth in the league to for maris so far this year both be good bunter maris once beat out eighteen of nineteen in the minor league mantle be a master at drag a bunt toward first base both have brilliant speed mantle be time from home plate bat left-handed to first base in 31 second fast than any other major leaguer maris run the 100-yard dash in ten second in high school and once win a race against luis aparicio the swift base-stealing shortstop of the white sox both be good dare fielder mantle cover more ground maris s throw arm be strong yet with all they skill the appeal of mantle and maris in 1961 come down to one basic the home run with this ultimate weapon the two yankee may have save baseball from it dull season american league expansion create inevitably weak team only two team in each league the yankee and detroit the dodger and cincinnati be battle for first place appropriately the emphasis on the home run at a peak this year come into be at baseball s low moment in 1920 a the startle news that the 1919 white sox have conspire to lose the world series leak out fan grow disillusion and disinterested in baseball something be need to revive interest the something be the home run
