he bring with he a mixture of myrrh and aloe of about a hundred pound weight they take jesus s body then and wrap it in winding-clothes with the spice that be how the jew prepare a body for burial list a present at the descent be mary mary s sister mary magdalene john joseph of arimathea nicodemus search a he might he could find no place where the bible speak of a moment when mary could have be alone with jesus mostly the scene be crowd with mourner such a the dramatic dellarca lamentation in bologna where the grief-stricken spectator have usurp mary s last poignant moment in he concept there could be no one else present he first desire be to create a mother and son alone in the universe when might mary have have that moment to hold she child on she lap perhaps after the soldier have lay he on the ground while joseph of arimathea be at pontius pilate s ask for christ s body nicodemus be gather he mixture of myrrh and aloe and the other have go home to mourn those who see he finish pieta would take the place of the biblical witness they would feel what mary be undergo there would be no halo no angel these would be two human being whom god have choose he feel close to mary have spend so long concentrate on the begin of she journey now she be intensely alive anguished she son be dead even though he would late be resurrect he be at this moment dead indeed the expression on he face reflect what he have go through on the cross in he sculpture therefore it would not be possible for he to project anything of what jesus feel for he mother only what mary feel for she son jesus inert body would be passive he eye close mary would have to carry the human communication this seem right to he it be a relief to shift in he mind to technical problem since he christ be to be life size how be mary to hold he on she lap without the relationship seem ungainly he mary would be slender of limb and delicate of proportion yet she must hold this full-grown man a securely and convincingly a she would a child there be only one way to accomplish this by design by draw diagram and sketch in which he probe the remote corner of he mind for creative idea to carry he concept he start by make free sketch to loosen up he think so that image would appear on paper visually these approximate what he be feel within himself at the same time he start walk the street peer at the people pass or shop at the stall store up fresh impression of what they look like how they move in particular he seek the gentle sweet-faced nun with head covering and veil come to the middle of they forehead remember they expression until he reach home and set they down on paper discover that drapery could be design to serve structural purpose he begin a study of the anatomy of fold he improvise a he go along complete a life-size clay figure then buy yard of an inexpensive material from a draper wet the lightweight cloth in a basin and cover it over with clay that argiento bring from the bank of the tiber to the consistency of thick mud no fold could be accidental each turn of the drapery have to serve organically to cover the madonna s slender leg and foot so that they would give substantive support to christ s body to intensify she inner turmoil when the cloth dry and stiffen he see what adjustment have to be make so that s sculpture comment argiento wryly when he have sluice down the floor for a week make mud pie michelangelo grin see argiento if you control the way these fold be bunch like this or make to flow you can enrich the body attitude they can have a much tactile appeal a flesh and bone he go into the jewish quarter want to draw hebraic face so that he could reach a visual understand of how christ might have look the jewish section be in trastevere near the tiber at the church of san francesco a ripa the colony have be small until the spanish inquisition of 1492 drive many jew into rome here for the most part they be well treat a a reminder of the old testament heritage of christianity many of they gift member be prominent in the vatican a physician musician banker the man do not object to he sketch they while they go about they work but no one could be persuade to come to he studio to pose he be tell to ask for rabbi melzi at the synagogue on saturday afternoon michelangelo find the rabbi in the room of study a gentle old man with a white beard and luminous grey eye robe in black gabardine with a skullcap on he head he be read from the talmud with a group of man from he congregation when michelangelo explain why he have come rabbi melzi reply gravely the bible forbid we to bow down to or to make graven image that be why we creative people give they time to literature not to painting or sculpture but rabbi melzi you do nt object to other create work of art not at all each religion have it own tenet i be carve a pieta from white carrara marble i wish to make jesus an authentic jew i can not accomplish this if you will not help i the rabbi say thoughtfully i would not want i people to get in trouble with the church i be work for the cardinal of san dionigi i m sure he would approve what kind of model would you prefer workman in they mid-thirties not bulky laborer but sinewy man with intelligence and sensitivity rabbi melzi smile at he with infinitely old but merry eye leave i you address i will send you the good the quarter have to offer michelangelo hurry to sangallo s solitary bachelor room with he sketch ask the architect to design a stand which would simulate the seat madonna sangallo study the drawing and improvise a trestle couch michelangelo buy some scrap lumber together he and argiento build the stand cover it with blanket he first model arrive at dusk he hesitate for a moment when michelangelo ask he to disrobe so michelangelo give he a piece of toweling to wrap around he loin lead he to the kitchen to take off he clothe he then drape he over the rough stand explain that he be suppose to be recently dead and be be hold on he mother s lap the model quite plainly think michelangelo crazy only the instruction from he rabbi keep he from bolt but at the end of the sit when michelangelo show he the quick free drawing with the mother rough in hold she son the model grasp what michelangelo be after and promise to speak to he friend he work for two hour a day with each model send by the rabbi mary present quite a different problem though this sculpture must take place thirty-three year after she moment of decision he could not conceive of she a a woman in she mid-fifties old wrinkle break in body and face by labor or worry he image of the virgin have always be that of a young woman even a have he memory of he mother jacopo galli introduce he into several roman home here he sketch sit in they flow gown of linen and silk young girl not yet twenty some about to be marry some marry a year or two since the santo spirito hospital have take only man he have have no experience in the study of female anatomy but he have sketch the woman of tuscany in they field and home he be able to discern the body line of the roman woman under they robe he spend concentrate week put he two figure together a mary who would be young and sensitive yet strong enough to hold she son on she lap and a jesus who though lean be strong even in death a look he remember well from he experience in the dead room of santo spirito he draw toward the composite design from he meticulously accurate memory without need to consult he sketch soon he be ready to go into a three-dimensional figure in clay here he would have free expression because the material could be move to distort form when he want to emphasize or get great intensity he add or subtract clay next he turn to wax because there be a similarity of wax to marble in tactile quality and translucence he respect each of these approach technique and keep they in character he quill drawing have a scratchiness suggest skin texture the clay he use plastically to suggest soft move flesh a in an abdomen in a recline torso the wax he smooth over to give the body surface an elastic pull yet he never allow these model to become fix in he mind they remain rough start point when carve he be charge with spontaneous energy too careful or detail study in clay and wax would have glue he down to a mere enlarge of he model the true surge have to be inside the marble itself draw and model be he think carve be action 10 the arrangement with argiento be work well except that sometimes michelangelo could not figure who be master and who apprentice argiento have be train so rigorously by the jesuit that michelangelo be unable to change he habit up before dawn to scrub the floor whether they be dirty or not water boil on the fire for wash laundry every day the pot scour with river sand after each meal argiento this be senseless he complain not like to work on the wet floor particularly in cold weather you re too clean scrub the studio once a week that s enough no say argiento stolidly every day before dawn i be teach and god help anyone who try to unteach you grumble michelangelo yet he know that he have nothing to grumble about for argiento make few demand on he the boy be become acquaint with the contadini family that bring produce into rome on sunday he would walk mile into the campagna to visit with they and in particular to see they horse the one thing he miss from he farm in the po valley be the animal frequently he would take he leave of michelangelo by announce today i go see the horse it take a piece of bad luck to show michelangelo that the boy be devote to he he be crouch over he anvil in the courtyard get he chisel into trim when a splinter of steel fly into he eye and imbed itself in he pupil he stumble into the house eye burn like fire argiento make he lie down on the bed bring a pan of hot water dip some clean white linen cloth and apply it to extract the splinter though the pain be considerable michelangelo be not too concern he assume he could blink the splinter out but it would not come argiento never leave he side keep the water boil apply hot compress throughout the night by the second day michelangelo begin to worry and by the second night he be in a state of panic he could see nothing out of the afflict eye at dawn argiento go to jacopo galli galli arrive with he family surgeon maestro lippi the surgeon carry a cage of live pigeon he tell argiento to take a bird out of the cage cut a large vein under it wing let the blood gush into michelangelo s injure eye the surgeon come back at dusk cut the vein of a second pigeon again wash out the eye
