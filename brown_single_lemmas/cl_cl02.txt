busy with a customer then slip around the back of the car with license number jym 114 attach the electronic bug to the rear bumper and walk out the attendant wave i on one of the hard chore a detective have be hang around on a city street try to make himself inconspicuous keep an eye on the entrance of an office build and wait for the first fifteen or twenty minute it s possible to be more or less interest in window display then in people pass by after a while however a person s mind get feed up and that magnify all of the disagreeable physical symptom which go with that sort of an assignment you want to sit down you leg muscle and back muscle feel weary you re conscious of the fact that you foot hurt that the city pavement be hard i wait a solid two hour before i man come out of the office build he come out alone i be nt far behind he when he enter the park lot and hurry over to he car the attendant recognize i once more and say what do you do about that office i have nt make up i mind yet i say it s a sublease i have a couple of they i m figure on one here and one that s out quite a way where there s usually curb park that curb park be undependable and annoy particularly when it rain he say i keep try to get he to take i money okay i tell he i m in a rush right now i know where the car be want i to drive it out i ll have one of the boy get it he say it s one of the rule on transient regular drive out they own car make it a snappy a you can will you i ask oh that s all right he say you re go to be a regular you ll get in the office build here you do nt want to lease a place way out in the stick you get business where the business be not where it be nt i grin at he hand he a couple of dollar and say by the time you get the park charge figure up there should be a cigar in it for you i hurry over to the agency heap jump in start the motor and be just in time to see the car i want to shadow turn to the leave i be hold up a bit try to make a leave turn by the time i d make it he be go traffic be pretty heavy i turn on the electric bug and the signal come in loud and clear i make time and pick he up within ten block i stay half a block behind he let lot of car keep in between we listen to the steady beep beep beep after fifteen minute of traffic drive he turn to the leave i could nt see he but the electric bug device give steady beep when it be straight ahead short half beep when the car i be follow be to the leave and long drawn-out beep when it turn to the right if it ever get behind i the beep turn to a buzz i turn leave too soon and get a signal show that i be still behind he but he be to the right after a while the signal become a buzz and i know he be behind i that mean he d park someplace i make a big circle until i locate the car park at the curb in front of an apartment house i find a park place half a block away sit in the car and wait i quarry be in the apartment house for two hour then he come out and start drive toward the beach by this time it be dark i could get up close to he where there be traffic but have to drop far behind when there be nt traffic i light would have be a giveaway if i d try to shadow he in the conventional manner moreover i d have lose he if it have nt be for the electronic shadow device he signal be come loud and clear and then all of a sudden it turn to a buzz i circle the block and find he be in the park lot of a high-class restaurant i sit where i could watch the exit and realize i be hungry i sit there with the faint odor of charcoal-broiled steak tantalize i nostril and occasionally catch the aroma of coffee i man come out an hour late drive to the beach turn right and after half a mile go to the swim and tan motel it be a fairly modern motel with quite a bit of electrical display in front i remember it be the peep tom place i wait until i man be come out of the office with the key to a cabin before i go in to register the card the man i be shadow have fill out be still on the counter i notice that he be in unit 12 and that he have register under the name of oscar l palmer and wife give a san francisco address he have write out the license number of he car but have transpose the last two figure an old dodge which be still good ninety-nine time out of a hundred the motel manager do nt check the license number on the plate against the license number the tenant write out if he do it s still good than an even chance he will nt notice the transposition of the number and if he should notice it the thing can be pass off a an honest mistake i use the alias of robert c richards give the first three letter and the first and last figure of the license number on the agency heap but a couple of phony number in between i could have write anything the manager of the motel be a woman who apparently do nt care she be comply with the law in regard to registration but she certainly be nt check license number or bother the tenant you mean you re all alone mr richards that s right you wife be nt go to join you late i do nt think so if you expect she to show up she say you d good put and wife on there it s a formality you know any difference in the rate i ask not to you she say smile it s ten dollar either way there be ice cube in a container at the far end and in another by the office there be three soft-drink vend machine and if you should be join by anybody try to keep thing quiet if you will we like to run a nice quiet place thank you i tell she i take another sidelong glance at the other registration card then take the key to unit 13 that she have give i and go down long enough to park the car the construction be reasonably solid not like the cracker-box construction of so many of the motel unit that have stucco all over the outside but wall that be thin enough so you can hear every movement of the people in the adjoin apartment i put a small electric amplifier against the wall on the side i want to case with the aid of that i could hear i man move around hear he cough a couple of time hear the toilet flush hear the sound of water run whoever he companion be go to be she be go to join he late she know where to come he do nt have to telephone i be so hungry i stomach feel all line of communication have be sever it s one thing to go without food when you re occupy with some work or when you re simply postponing a meal but when you re dependent on someone else and know that you can nt eat until he s bed down for the night hunger can be a gnaw torture i have notice a drive-in down the road a quarter of a mile the battery on the bug device i have put on the car be still fresh enough to send out good strong signal the powerful microphone i could press against the wall between i motel unit and that occupy by the man would bring in the sound of any conversation and i be positively nauseate i be so hungry i get in the car drive down to the drive-in and order a couple of hamburger with everything include a cup of coffee and the fast service possible the place be nt particularly busy at that time of night and the girl who be wait on i who be clothe in the tightest-fitting pair of slack i have ever see on a woman and a sweater that show everything there be and there be lot of it want to be sociable you really in a hurry handsome she ask i m in a hurry beautiful it s early in the even to be in a hurry there s lot of time leave there may not be any woman leave i say she give a little pout and say i do nt get off work until eleven oclock that s when i even commence i ll be here at ten-fifty-five i say oh you she announce that s what they all say what s that thing go buzz-buzz-buzz in you car i say darn it that s the automatic signal that show when the ignition key be on i do nt turn it off i reach over and switch off the electronic bug device she go in to get the hamburger and i switch on the device again and keep the signal from dowl s car come in steady and clear until i see she start back with the hamburger then i shut off the device again she want to hang around while i be eat do nt you think it s selfish to have dinner before you go to pick she up no i say it s a kindness to she you see she s on a diet she ll eat just a pineapple and cottage cheese salad and i m to have one with she so she will nt feel out of place diet can be terrible the girl say how much overweight be she not a bit i say but she s keep she figure in hand she look at i provocatively good figure should be keep in hand she say and walk away with an exaggerate wiggle i turn on the device again half fearful that i might find silence but the buzz come in loud and clear when i switch on the light for she to come and get the check i have the exact change plus a dollar tip
