i realize that hamlet be face with an entirely different problem but he agony could have be no great the most that be accomplish be add mrs beige s tray to the dish pile and by mean of repeat threat on an ascend scale see that the girl dress themselves after a fashion i be save from make the decision a the phone ring and the girl be upon i instantly here s a household hint if you can nt find you child and get tire of call they pick up the phone no matter if you child be at the movie in school visit they grandmother or on a field trip in some distant city they will be upon you magically within second after you pick up the phone jennie and miranda twine themselves around i murmur endearment louise climb onto a stool and clutch the hand with which i be try to hold the phone claim i immediate attention on ground of extreme emergency somehow manage to get out a cool poise will nt you hold on a second please i cover up the mouthpiece and with more warmth and less poise give a quick lecture on crime and punishment mostly the latter include devil s island and the remote reach of siberia i promise to illustrate the lecture if they so much a breathe till after the call be complete speak into the phone again and recognize the caller i resume i everyday voice soon we be deep in a conversation that be interrupt many time by little thing like jennie s hold she breath and pretend to black out miranda s dump the content of the sugar bowl on the table and various screech thud and giggle under the circumstance i have difficulty keep up with the conversation on the phone but when i hang up i be reasonably certain that francesca have want to remind i of we town meet the next even and how important it be that hank and i be there i discover that the girl have shrewdly vacate the kitchen and be play quietly in the live room it seem that i would be the gainer if i accept the peace and quiet instead of carry out i threat resolve to get something do i start in on the dish no i m not say it right what i mean to say be that i start to start in on the dish by gather they all together in the kitchen sink they look so formidable however so demand that i find myself stare at they in dismay and start to woolgather again this time about francesca and she husband how about they i think francesca and herbert be among the few people we know in catatonia we do nt even know they till about a month after we move at that time they have call on we after i meet fran at a pta meet and have take we in hand socially they have be kind to we and we be indebted to they for one or two pleasant dinner and for information a to where to shop which dentist doctor plumber and sitter to call not that there be much of a choice since catatonia be just a village the yellow page of the telephone book be amazingly thin they be personality herb an expert on narrow tie thin lapel and swatch be man s fashion editor of parvenu the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation fran and he have meet about two year after she have arrive in manhattan from nebraska or be it wyoming she be the daughter and sole heiress of either a cattle baron or an oil millionaire and have arrive in new york with a big bank roll become a dabbler in various field she patronize greenwich village artist for awhile then put some money into a broadway show which be successful terrible but successful it be during she write period that she and herb meet and decide that they be in love they be marry at a lavish ceremony which be duly record in parvenu and all other magazine and newspaper and then they honeymoon in bermuda no not bermuda bermuda be not in style that year they have honeymoon in rome everyone be very high on rome that year they have buy they house in catatonia after investigate all the region of suburbia surround new york they have choose catatonia because of it reputation for excellent school beach and abundance of name you be bind to get involve with people when you have child fran have tell i at we first meet so it be good to know that those with whom you get involve be not just dreary little housewife and dull husband but people who do thing i admire they easy way of do thing but i could nt escape an uneasiness at they way of always do the right thing they house be a centuries-old colonial which they have have restore guide by an eminent architect and update and add on to it have a gourmet s corner instead of a kitchen a breakfast room a luncheon room a dine room a sit room a room for stand up a party room dress room for everybody even a room for mud it be all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that they child would color in the colore room paint in the painting room play with block in the block house and do all the other thing in the proper room at exactly the right time they two boy be well adjust and like they parent always do the right thing at the right time and damn the consequence francesca and herbert consider themselves violently nonconformist and show the world they be by fill they colonial house with contemporary furniture and painting and other art object expensive but not necessarily valuable contemporary thing fran flaunt she independence by rebel against the catatonia uniform of bermuda shorts and knee-length sock by wear bermuda shorts and knee-length sock in color bright pink and plaid and vivid stripe sometimes she even wear the uniform in solid unrelieved black and with she blonde hair cut so closely wear this uniform she strongly resemble a member of the ss no one could dislike they i think sometimes though they do not seem quite human it seem indeed that they house be not so much a home but rather a perfect stage set and that they be actor who have be hand fat role in a successful play and have talent enough to fill the role competently with nice understatement practically the only enthusiasm they show be when they be discuss name even brand name you should hear the reverence in fran s voice when she say baccarat or steuben or madame alexander she always let it be know that there be wine in the pot roast or that the chicken have be marinate in brandy and that koussevitzky s second cousin be an intimate of theirs i would nt have waste time puzzle over this couple be it not for i fear that all the other inhabitant of catatonia be equally unreal i could nt feel at home among they besides francesca there be blanche francesca be pleasant and charm but blanche be sweet yes blanche be very very sweet be in she company be like be drown in warm melt marshmallow i have once be a witness when blanche have smile and say with only minimum ruefulness oh i souffle have collapse anyone know how a real red-blooded woman would react to such a catastrophe if blanche have be honest she would have yell slam at least a couple of door and throw a few little valueless thing but dear i no not blanche after five minute with blanche one might welcome the astringency of grazie who be a sort of gwen cafritz to francesca s perle mesta francesca and grazie be habitual committee chairman and they usually manage to be elect co-chairman equal boss of whatever pta or civic project be be launch they be inseparable not because they be fond of each other but because they want to keep an eye on each other a they be keen rival for social leadership grazie be mean quietly mean and bitterly unfunnily sarcastic she it be who have look to see if i be wear shoe upon learn that i could nt drive grazie have a small slick head and she hair and skin be the color of golden toast she live in an ultra-modern house whose decoration appointment paint and even pet be choose to complement she colore the pet be a couple of siamese cat she uniform be of rich raw silk in a shade which match she hair skin housepaint and cat and since she be so thin a to be almost shapeless she rather resemble a freeze fish stick the husband of these woman and other i have meet in catatonia be distinguish only in that they be to i at least indistinguishable i could nt tell one from the other like herbert they be all in communication radio television magazine and advertise one or two be writer of book all be fellow of finite charm each have develop a hair-trigger chuckle and the habit of say zounds in deference to country-squirehood i never think i d live to hear people chuckle and say zounds in real life i would nt have miss it for anything they be sincere man of the too-hearty handclasp and the urgent smile these boy acknowledge an introduction to anybody by gently press one of he hand in both of theirs while they gaze misty-eyed with care into the eye of the person they be meet could such unadulterated love for a total strange be credit they be always leap to light cigarette open car door fill plate or glass and i mistrust the whole lot of they to the same degree that i mistrust bake shop that call themselves sanitary bake shop o pioneer i think and wonder what kind of homestead such odd pioneer would establish in this suburban frontier pioneer who look like off-duty gardener even at parent-teacher conference and who never call the school principal mister i sigh think that among other thing people here seem to be those who would have to cut down if they earn less than $ 85000 yearly people who would give they tooth for a chance to get on person to person people who think it be nice to be important but not important to be nice who be more ingratiate than gracious more personality than person in i estimation they be people who read daphne do maurier and discuss kafka well not discuss he exactly but say kafka reverently and raise they eye a if they be at a loss to describe how they feel about kafka which they be because they have no opinion about kafka not have read kafka they be i feel people invariably try to prove not who but what they be and try to determine what not who other be become aware that it be nearly lunchtime i bring myself back to the task at hand i make plan for the afternoon do the breakfast and luncheon dish all at once make the bed and then maybe painting the kitchen then i remember that the girl have have a banana for dessert every day for the last week banana jennie have shout each time they re not dessert they re not even food they re just something you re suppose to put on cereal for breakfast i dig around and find a mix and be able to surprise they with a devils-food cake with chocolate ice sometimes i think you need only one rule for cook if you can nt put garlic in it put chocolate in it the cake be receive in a stun silence that be evidence in itself of the dearth of taste thrill mama have be provide then jennie close she eye stretch forth she arm and say take i hand louise i m a strange in paradise
