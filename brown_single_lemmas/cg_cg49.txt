in one of the very few letter in which he ever complain of meynell thompson tell patmore of he distress at have have to leave london before this new friendship have develop far that be a very absurd and annoy situation in which i be place by w m s curious method of handle i he never let i know that i visit be about to terminate until the actual morning i be to leave for lymington the result be that i find myself in the ridiculous position of have make a formal engagement by letter for the next week only two day before i departure from london luckily both woman know i position and if anyone suffer in they opinion it be not i it need hardly be remark that thompson be not generally know for he scrupulosity about keep he social engagement which make he irritation in this letter all the more significant when thompson and she daughter begin a correspondence which include fervent verse from pantasaph mrs king feel a proper victorian alarm some she know look upon thompson almost a a saint but other read in the hound of heaven what they take to be the confession of a great sinner who like oscar wilde have a one pious writer late put it throw himself on the swell wave of every passion consequently on october 31 1896 mrs king write to thompson quite against she daughter s wish ask he not to recommence a correspondence which i believe have be drop for some week katherine be stay at a convent and she mother feel that a thompson himself seem to have suggest she might eventually stay there this prospect do not please mrs king any more than do the possibility that she daughter might marry a bohemian but she use it to suggest to thompson that it be not in she nature to love you for he part thompson have explain in a previous letter that there would be nothing but an honorable friendship between katie and himself at no time do he seem to have propose marriage and mrs king be evidently tear between a concern for she daughter s emotion and the desire to believe that the friendship might be continue without harm to she reputation in any case she tell thompson that she see no reason why he might not see katie again now that this frank explanation have be make & no one can misunderstand she end she letter with the assurance that she consider he friendship for she daughter and herself to be an honor from which she could not part without still more pain after thompson come to london to live he receive a letter from katie which be date february 8 1897 she regret what she describe a the unwarrantable & unnecessary check to they friendship and say that she feel that they understand one another perfectly this letter conclude with an invitation i be a great deal at the little child s hospital mr meynell know the way i know you be very busy now you be write a great deal & you book be come out be nt it but if you be able & care to come you know how glad i shall be ever yours sincerely katherine douglas king the invitation be accept and other letter follow in which she speak of she concern for he health and she delight in see he so much at home among the cripple child she serve it be difficult to say what thompson expect would come of they relationship which have begin so soon after he emotion have be stir by maggie brien but when katie write on april 11 1900 to tell he that she be to be marry to the rev godfrey burr the vicar of rushall in staffordshire the news evidently help to deepen he discouragement over the failure of he hope for a new volume of verse in a letter to meynell which be write in june less than a month before katie s wedding he be highly melodramatic in he despair and once again announce he intention of return to the life of the street a week in arrears and without mean to pay i must go it be the only right thing perhaps mrs meynell would do i the undeserved kindness to keep i own copy of the first edition of i first book with all it memento of she and the dear one last not least there be some poem which k king send i address to herself when i be prepare a fresh volume ask i to include they the terrible blow of the new year put an end to that project i wish you would return they to she i have not the heart i never have the courage to look at they when i project volume become hopeless fear they be poor until now when i be oblige to do so o i genius young and ripen you would swear when i write they and now what have it all come to all chance of fulfil i destiny be over i want you to be grandfather to these orphaned poem dear father-brother now i be go and launch they on the world when they time come for they a box will be lodgment enough katie can not mind you see they now since i silence must have end when i give the purpose volume to you i ask you to do i the last favour of read they by 8 to-morrow even about which time i shall come to say i sad good-bye if you do nt think much of they tell i the wholesome truth if otherwise you will give i a pleasure o wilfrid it be strange but this yes terrible step i be about to take be lighten with an inundate joy by the new-found hope that here in these poem be treasure or at least some measure of beauty which i do not know of thompson of course be persuade not to take the terrible step meynell once again pay he debt and it be katie rather than thompson whose life be soon end for she die in childbirth in april 1901 in the first year of she marriage the orphaned poem mention in the letter to meynell comprise a group of five sonnet which be publish in the 1913 edition of thompson s work under the head ad amicam plus certain other complete piece and rough draft gather together in one of the familiar exercise book the publication of father connolly s the man have wing have make more of the group available in print so that a general picture of what it contain can now be have without difficulty some of the poem express a mood of joy in a newly discover love other suggest it come loss or describe the poet s feeling when he learn of a final separation the somewhat petrarchan love story which these poem suggest can not obscure the fact that undoubtedly they have more than a little of autobiographical sincerity when they be first write there be evidently no think of they be publish and those which refer to the writer s love for mrs meynell particularly have the ring of truth in i song s young virgin date for example thompson write yea she that have i song s young virgin date not now alas that noble singular she i nobl hold though mar from she once state than other in they good integrity i own stern hand have rent the ancient bond and thereof shall the end not have end but not for i that love she to be fond lightly to please i with a new friend then hold it more than bravest-feathered song that i affirm to thou with heart of pride i know not what do to a friend belong till i stand up true friend by thou true side whose absence dear comfort be by far than presence of other woman be take into account thompson s capacity for self-dramatization and the possibility of a wish to identify he own life with the misfortune of other poet who have know unhappy love there can be no doubt about he genuine emotion for katie king that she be affect by he protestation seem obvious but since she be evidently a sensible young woman a well a an outgoing and sympathetic type it would seem that for she the word friendship have a far less intense emotional significance than that which thompson give it from the outset she must have realize that marriage with he be out of the question and although she be displease by the unwarrantable interference it seem probable that she do agree with she mother s suggestion that the poet be perhaps a man most fit to live & die solitary & in the love only of the high lover the poem which be address to she while they be far more restrain than those of love in dian s lap show no great technical advance over those of the narrow vessel group and be if anything somewhat more labored they interest remain chiefly biographical for they throw some light on the utter despair which overtake thompson in the spring and early summer of 1900 whether or not danchin be correct in suggest that thompson s resumption of the opium habit also date from this period be of course a matter of conjecture reid simply state without offer any support evidence that after he return to london he resume he draught of laudanum and continue this right up to he death there be every reason to recognize that in the very last year of he life a we shall see thompson do take the drug in carefully ration dose to ease the pain of he illness but the exact date at which this begin have never be determine if a reid say nearly all he poetry be produce when he be not take opium there may be some reason to doubt that he be under it influence in the period from 1896 to 1900 when he be write the poem to katie king and make plan for another book of verse in any event the critical productivity of that time be abundant proof that if he be take laudanum it be never in command of he to the extent that it have be during he vagrant year meynell s remedy for thompson s despondent mood be typically practical he simply find more work for he to do and the article and review continue without an evident break 3 a a reviewer thompson generally display a judicious attitude that he read some of the book assign to he with a study carefulness be evident from he note which be often so full that they provide an unquestionable basis for the identification of review that be print without he signature on the basis of this careful read thompson frequently give a clear complete and interest description of a prose work or choose effective quotation to illustrate he discussion of poetry he be seldom an unmethodical critic and he review generally follow a systematic pattern a description of what the work contain a treatment of the thing that have especially interest he in it and wherever possible a balance of whatever artistic merit and fault he might have find it be of course in this draw of the balance sheet of judgment that he most clearly display he desire to do full justice to an author review davidson s the testament of an empire builder for example thompson find that there be too much metrical dialectic poetry he say must be dogmatic it must not stoop to argue like a kc in cloth-of-gold yet davidson impress he a a poet capable of sustain power passion or beauty and he cite specific passage to illustrate not only these quality but davidson s command of imagery a well similarly he write that laurence housman have a too deliberate manner a well a a lack of inevitable felicity in diction but he admire housman s subtle intellectuality and delight in the inversion by which divine love become the most fatal allurement in love the tempter of course there be book about which nothing good could be say understand a he do the difficulty of the art of poetry and believe that the only technical criticism worth have in poetry be that of poet he feel oblige to insist upon he duty to be hard to please when it come to the review of a book of verse
