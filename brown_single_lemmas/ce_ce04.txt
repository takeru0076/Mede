the lyric beauty of schubert s trout quintet it elemental rhythm and infectious melody make it a source of pure pleasure for almost all music listener but for student of musical form and would-be classifier the work present it problem since it require only five player it would seem to fall into the category of chamber music yet it call for a double bass an instrument generally regard a symphonic moreover the piece be write in five movement rather than the conventional four of most quintet and this give the opus a serenade or divertimento flavor the many and frequent performance of the trout serve to emphasize the dual nature of it write some rendition be of symphonic dimension with the contrabass give free rein other interpretation present the music a an essentially intimate creation in these reading the double bass be either keep discreetly in the background or it be dress in clown s attire the musical equivalent of a bull in a china shop recently i be strike anew by the divergent approach when in the course of one afternoon and even i listen to no fewer than ten different performance the occasion for this marathon angel s long-awaited reissue in it great recording of the century series of the schnabel-pro arte version let i say at the outset that the music sound a sparkle on the last play a it do on the first whether consider alone or in relation to other edition colh 40 be a document of prime importance artur schnabel be one of the great schubert-beethoven-mozart player of all time and any commentary of he on this repertory be valuable but schnabel be a great teacher in addition to be a great performer and the fact that four of the ten version i listen to be by schnabel pupil clifford curzon frank glazer adrian aeschbacher and victor babin also shed light on the master s pedagogical skill certain pianistic trait be common to all five schnabelian rendition most notably the schnabel trill which differ from the conventional trill in that the two note be strike simultaneously but the most impressive testimony to schnabel s distinction a a teacher be reflect by the individuality which mark each student s approach a distinctly he own schnabel s emphasis on structural clarity he innate rhythmic vibrancy and impetuous intensity all tend to stamp he read a a symphonic one yet no detail be too small to receive attention from this master and a a result the play here have humor delicacy and radiant humanity this be a serious-minded interpretation but it be never strait-laced and although schnabel s pianism bristle with excitement it be meticulously faithful to schubert s dynamic marking and phrase indication the piano performance on this trout be one that really demand a search for superlative about the pro arte s contribution i be less happy i for one rather regret that schnabel do nt collaborate with the budapest quartet whose rugged athletic play be a good deal close to this pianist s interpretative outlook than the style of the belgian group from a technical standpoint the string play be good but the pro arte people fail to enter into the spirit of thing here the violinist in particular be very indulgent with swoop and slide and he tone be pinch and edgy the twenty-five-year-old record offer rather fade string tone but the balance between the instrument be good and the transfer be very quiet there be a break in continuity just before the fourth variation in the forellen movement and i suspect that this be due to imperfect splice between side of the original afj turn to the more modern version curzon s london offer the most sophisticate keyboard work every detail in he interpretation have be beautifully think out and of these i would especially cite the delicious laendler touch the pianist bring to the fifth variation an obvious indication that he be play with viennese musician and the gossamer shade throughout some of curzon s play strike i a finicky however why for example do he favor two tempo rather than one for the third movement the assist musician from the vienna octet be somewhat lack in expertise but they contribution be rustic and appeal special compliment to the double bass play of johann krumpp he scrawny totter sound add a delightful hilarity to the performance the glazer-fine art edition concert-disc be a model of lucidity and organization it be moreover a perfectly integrate ensemble effort but have live with the disc for some time now i find the performance less exciting than either schnabel s or fleisher s whose superb performance with the budapest quartet have still to be record and a good deal less fill with humor than curzon s aeschbacher s work be very much akin to schnabel s but the sound on he decca disc be date and you will have a hard time locate a copy of it the hephzibah menuhin-amadeus quartet angel and victor babin-festival quartet rca victor edition give we superlative string play both in symphonic style cripple by unimaginative piano play babin have acquire some of schnabel s keyboard manner but he play be of limit insight badura-skoda-vienna konzerthaus westminster and demus-schubert quartet deutsche grammophon be both warm-toned pleasantly lyrical but rather slack and tensionless helmut roloff play with a group of musician from the bayreuth ensemble give a sturdy read in much the same vein a that of the last-mentioned pianist telefunken have accord he beautiful sound and this bargain-priced disc it sell for $ 298 be worthy of consideration return once again to the schnabel reissue i be beguile anew by the magnificence of this pianist s musical penetration here be truly a great record of the century and it greatness be by no mean diminish by the fact that it be not quite perfect this record surely belong in everyone s collection must record always sound like record from the begin of commercial record new disc purport to be indistinguishable from the real thing have regularly be put in circulation see in perspective many of these release have a genuine claim to be milestone although lack absolute verisimilitude they supply the ear and the imagination with all necessary material for re-creation of the original on the basis of what they give we we can know how the young caruso sing appreciate the distinctive quality of parsifal under karl muck s baton or sense the type of ensemble toscanini create in he year with the new york philharmonic since the concept of high fidelity become important some dozen year ago the claim of technical improvement have multiply tenfold in many case the revolutionary production have offer no more than sensational effect the first hear be fascinate and the second disillusion a the gap between sound and substance become clear other innovation with good claim to musical interest survive rehear to acquire in time the status of classic if we return to they today we have no difficulty spot they weakness but we find they still please record sound like record because they provide a different sort of experience than live music this difference be make up of many factor some of they be obvious such a the fact that we associate record and live music with we response and behavior in different type of environment and social setting music often sound good to i when i can dress informally and sit in something more comfortable than a theatre seat from the technical standpoint record differ from live music to the degree that they fail to convey the true color texture complexity range intensity pulse and pitch of the original any alteration of one of these factor be distortion although we generally use that word only for effect so pronounce that they can be state quantitatively on the basis of standard test yet it be the accumulation of distortion the fit together of fractional bit until the total reach the threshold of we awareness that make record sound like record the sound may be good but if you know the real thing you know that what you be hear be only a clever imitation command s new brahm second be a major effort to make a record that sound like a real orchestra rather than a copy of one like the recent scheherazade from london high fidelity sept 1961 it be successful because emphasis have be place on good musical and engineering practice rather than on create sensational effect because of this only those with truly fine equipment will be able to appreciate the exact degree of the engineer triumph the easy way to describe this release be to say that it reproduce an interest and effective steinberg performance with minimal alteration of it musical value the engineering a such never obtrude upon you consciousness the effect of the record be very open and natural with the frequency emphasis exactly what you would expect from a live performance this absence of peaky high and beefed-up bass not only produce great fidelity but it eliminate listener fatigue a contribute factor be the perspective the uniform aesthetic distance which be maintain the orchestra be far enough away from you that you miss the bow scrape valve click and other noise incidental to play yet you feel the orchestra be near at hand and the individual instrument have the same firm presence associate with listen from a good seat in an acoustically perfect hall command have achieve the ideal amount of reverberation the music be always allow the live space need to attain it full sonority yet the hall never intrude a a quasi-performer the timbre remain that of the instrument unclouded by resonance all of this would be waste of course if the performance lack authority and musical distinction for i it have more of both element than the majority of it competitor steinberg seem to have go directly back to the score discount tradition and have build he performance on the intention to reproduce a faithfully a possible exactly what brahm set down on paper those accustom to broad more romantic statement of the symphony can be expect to react strongly when they hear this one without lose the distinctive undertow of brahmsian rhythm the pace be firm and the over-all performance have a tightly knit quality that make for maximum cumulative effect the presto ma non assai of the first trio of the scherzo be take literally and may shock you a the real allegro con spirito of the finale be likely to bring you to you foot in the end however the thing about this performance that be most strike be the way it sing steinberg obviously have conclude that it be the lyric element which must dominate in this score and he manage at time to create the effect of the whole orchestra burst into song the engineering provide exactly the support need for such a result too many record seem to reduce a work of symphonic complexity to a melody and it accompaniment the command technique invite you to listen to the depth of the orchestration you ear take you into the ensemble and you may well become aware of instrumental detail which previously be apparent only in the score it be this sort of experience that make the concept of high fidelity of real musical significance for the home music listener the first substantially complete stereo giselle and the only one of it scope since feyer s four-sided lp edition of 1958 for angel this set be i m afraid likely to provide more horrid fascination than enjoyment the already fade pastel charm of the naive music itself vanish entirely in fistoulari s melodramatic contrast between ultravehement brute power and chilly if suave sentimentality and in it engineer frantic attempt to achieve maximum dynamic impact and earsplitting brilliance the record sound a though it have be doctore for super-high fidelity the home listener be overpower all right but the experience be a far from pleasant one a with the penultimate giselle release wolff s abridgment for rca victor i find the clean less razor-edged monophonic version for all it lack of big-stage spaciousness the more aurally tolerable but this may be the result of process defect in i sd copy
