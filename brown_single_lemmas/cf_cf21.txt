a tsunami may be start by a sea bottom slide an earthquake or a volcanic eruption the most infamous of all be launch by the explosion of the island of krakatoa in 1883 it race across the pacific at 300 mile an hour devastate the coast of java and sumatra with wave 100 to 130 foot high and pound the shore a far away a san francisco the ancient greek record several catastrophic inundation by huge wave whether or not plato s tale of the lose continent of atlantis be true skeptics concede that the myth may have some foundation in a great tsunami of ancient time indeed a tremendously destructive tsunami that arise in the arabian sea in 1945 have even revive the interest of geologist and archaeologist in the biblical story of the flood one of the most damage tsunami on record follow the famous lisbon earthquake of november 1 1755 it wave persist for a week and be feel a far away a the english coast tsunami be rare however in the atlantic ocean they be far more common in the pacific japan have have 15 destructive one eight of they disastrous since 1596 the hawaiian island be strike severely an average of once every 25 year in 1707 an earthquake in japan generate wave so huge that they pile into the inland sea one wave swamp more than 1000 ship and boat in osaka bay a tsunami in the hawaiian island in 1869 wash away an entire town ponoluu leave only two forlorn tree stand where the community have be in 1896 a japanese tsunami kill 27000 people and sweep away 10000 home the dimension of these wave dwarf all we usual standard of measurement an ordinary sea wave be rarely more than a few hundred foot long from crest to crest no long than 320 foot in the atlantic or 1000 foot in the pacific but a tsunami often extend more than 100 mile and sometimes a much a 600 mile from crest to crest while a wind wave never travel at more than 60 mile per hour the velocity of a tsunami in the open sea must be reckon in hundreds of mile per hour the great the depth of the water the great be the speed of the wave lagrange s law say that it velocity be equal to the square root of the product of the depth time the acceleration due to gravity in the deep water of the pacific these wave reach a speed of 500 mile per hour tsunami be so shallow in comparison with they length that in the open ocean they be hardly detectable they amplitude sometimes be a little a two foot from trough to crest usually it be only when they approach shallow water on the shore that they build up to they terrify height on the fateful day in 1896 when the great wave approach japan fisherman at sea notice no unusual swell not until they sail home at the end of the day through a sea strew with body and the wreckage of house be they aware of what have happen the seemingly quiet ocean have crash a wall of water from 10 to 100 foot high upon beach crowd with bather drown thousands of they and flatten village along the shore the giant wave be more dangerous on flat shore than on steep one they usually range from 20 to 60 foot in height but when they pour into a v-shaped inlet or harbor they may rise to mountainous proportion generally the first salvo of a tsunami be a rather sharp swell not different enough from an ordinary wave to alarm casual observer this be follow by a tremendous suck of water away from the shore a the first great trough arrive reef be leave high and dry and the beach be cover with strand fish at hilo large number of people run out to inspect the amaze spectacle of the denude beach many of they pay for they curiosity with they life for some minute late the first giant wave roar over the shore after an earthquake in japan in 1793 people on the coast at tugaru be so terrify by the extraordinary eb of the sea that they scurry to high ground when a second quake come they dash back to the beach fear that they might be bury under landslide just a they reach the shore the first huge wave crash upon they a tsunami be not a single wave but a series the wave be separate by interval of 15 minute to an hour or more because of they great length and this have often lull people into think after the first great wave have crash that it be all over the wave may keep come for many hour usually the third to the eighth wave in the series be the big among the observer of the 1946 tsunami at hilo be francis p shepard of the scripps institution of oceanography one of the world s foremost marine geologist he be able to make a detail inspection of the wave they onrush and retreat he report be accompany by a great hiss roar and rattle the third and fourth wave seem to be the high on some of the island beach the wave come in gently they be steep on the shore face the direction of the seaquake from which the wave have come in hilo bay they be from 21 to 26 foot high the high wave 55 foot occur at pololu valley scientist and fisherman have occasionally see strange by-product of the phenomenon during a 1933 tsunami in japan the sea glow brilliantly at night the luminosity of the water be now believe to have be cause by the stimulation of vast number of the luminescent organism noctiluca miliaris by the turbulence of the sea japanese fisherman have sometimes observe that sardine haul up in they net during a tsunami have enormously swell stomach the fish have swallow vast number of bottom-living diatom raise to the surface by the disturbance the wave of a 1923 tsunami in sagami bay bring to the surface and batter to death huge number of fish that normally live at a depth of 3000 foot gratify fisherman haul they in by the thousands the tsunami-warning system develop since the 1946 disaster in hawaii rely mainly on a simple and ingenious instrument devise by commander ck green of the coast and geodetic survey staff it consist of a series of pipe and a pressure-measuring chamber which record the rise and fall of the water surface ordinary water tide be disregard but when wave with a period of between 10 and 40 minute begin to roll over the ocean they set in motion a correspond oscillation in a column of mercury which close an electric circuit this in turn set off an alarm notify the observer at the station that a tsunami be in progress such equipment have be install at hilo midway attu and dutch harbor the moment the alarm go off information be immediately forward to honolulu which be the center of the warn system this center also receive prompt report on earthquake from four coast survey station in the pacific which be equip with seismograph it staff make a preliminary determination of the epicenter of the quake and alert tide station near the epicenter for a tsunami by mean of chart show wave-travel time and depth in the ocean at various location it be possible to estimate the rate of approach and probable time of arrival at hawaii of a tsunami get under way at any spot in the pacific the civil and military authority be then advise of the danger and they issue warning and take all necessary protective step all of these activity be gear to a top-priority communication system and practice test have be hold to assure that everything will work smoothly since the 1946 disaster there have be 15 tsunami in the pacific but only one be of any consequence on november 4 1952 an earthquake occur under the sea off the kamchatka peninsula at 1707 that afternoon greenwich time the shock be record by the seismograph alarm in honolulu the warn system immediately go into action within about an hour with the help of report from seismic station in alaska arizona and california the quake s epicenter be place at 51 degree north latitude and 158 degree east longitude while account of the progress of the tsunami come in from various point in the pacific midway report it be cover with nine foot of water the hawaiian station make it calculation and notify the military service and the police that the first big wave would arrive at honolulu at 2330 greenwich time it turn out that the wave be not so high a in 1946 they hurl a cement barge against a freighter in honolulu harbor knock down telephone line maroon automobile flood lawn kill six cow but not a single human life be lose and property damage in the hawaiian island do not exceed $ 800000 there be little doubt that the warn system save life and reduce the damage but it be plain that a warn system however efficient be not enough in the vulnerable area of the pacific there should be restriction against build home on expose coast or at least a requirement that they be either raise off the ground or anchored strongly against wave the key to the world of geology be change nothing remain the same life have evolve from simple combination of molecule in the sea to complex combination in man the land too be change and earthquake be daily reminder of this earthquake result when movement in the earth twist rock until they break sometimes this be accompany by visible shift of the ground surface often the shift can not be see but they be there and everywhere can be find scar of early break once deeply bury today s earthquake be most numerous in belt where the earth s restlessness be presently concentrate but scar of the past show that there be no part of the earth that have not have they the effect of earthquake on civilization have be widely publicize even overemphasize the role of an earthquake in start the destruction of whole city be tremendously frighten but fire may actually be the principal agent in a particular disaster superstition have often blend with fact to color report we have learn from earthquake much of what we now know about the earth s interior for they send wave through the earth which emerge with information about the material through which they have travel these wave have show that 1800 mile below the surface a liquid core begin and that it in turn have a solid inner core earthquake originate a far a 400 mile below the surface but they do not occur at great depth two unsolved mystery be base on these fact 1 a far down a 400 mile below the surface the material should be hot enough to be plastic and adjust itself to twist force by sluggish flow rather than by break a rigid surface rock do 2 if earthquake do occur at such depth why not deep knowledge gain from study earthquake wave have be apply in various field in the search for oil and gas we make similar wave under control condition with dynamite and learn from they where there be bury rock structure favorable to the accumulation of these resource we have also develop technique for recognize and locate underground nuclear test through the wave in the ground which they generate the follow discussion of this subject have be adapt from the book cause of catastrophe by l don leet the restless earth and it interior at twelve minute after five on the morning of wednesday april 18 1906 san francisco be shake by a severe earthquake a sharp tremor be follow by a jerky roll
