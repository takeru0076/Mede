from time to time the medium mention other people around he who be on the other side and report what they be say after a while there come initial and name and he be interest to hear some rather unusual family nickname a the hour progress the sensitive seem to probe more deeply and to make more personal and specific statement there be a few prognoses of come event another medium another sitter would produce a somewhat different content but in general it would probably sound much like the forego read some medium speak in practical down-to-earth term while other may stress the spiritual not all a a matter of fact consider themselves medium in the sense of receive message from the deceased in fact some sensitive rule this out prefer to consider they expression a strictly extra-sensory perception esp on this side of the veil however that may be people be know to go to medium for diverse reason perhaps they be mourn a recent death and want comfort to feel in touch with the deceased or seek indication for future plan they may of course be curiosity seeker or they may just be interest in the phenomenon of mediumship the medium with whom the parapsychology foundation be work in this experiment be in a wake or only slightly dissociate state so that the sitter can make comment ask and answer question instead of talk with a control who speak through an entrance sensitive what we have here be in some way more like an ordinary conversation but it be not really only a conversation many a sitter in a personal sit have be amaze to realize that the medium be describe very vividly he state of mind he himself might not have be really aware of he own mood it have be latent unspecified semi-conscious and only partly realize until she describe it to he most strike indeed be this beyond-normal ability to put a finger on pre-conscious mood and to clarify they however in the next visit that the researcher make to the medium he do not receive a personal read instead he bring with he the name of some people he have never meet and of whom the medium know nothing for this be to be a proxy sit a be note early it be important that in valid objective study of this sort of communication the interest sitter should be separate from the sensitive dr karlis osis director of research at the parapsychology foundation describe the basis for the experiment in a tomorrow article new research on survival after death spring 1958 he remark it have be clearly establish that in a number of instance the message do not come from a spirit but be receive telepathically by the medium from the sitter the possibility have to be rule out that the medium s esp may tap the memory of the sitter and to do this the two central character in this drama must be separate one way to do this be by proxy sitting wherein the person seek a message do not himself meet with the medium but be represent by a substitute the proxy sitter if the latter know nothing about the absent sitter except he name give by the experimenter he can not possibly give any clue conscious or unconscious far less ask lead question all he can do be to be an objective and careful questioner seek to help the sensitive in clarify and make more specific she paranormal impression sometimes in these experiment appointment sitting be use here the absent sitter make a date with a communicator someone close to he who be deceased ask he to come in at a certain hour when a channel will be open for he in this case the proxy sitter will know only the name of the communicator nothing else he give this to the medium at the appoint time and the read then will be concern with material about or message from the communicator a always a tape record or detail note be make and a typescript of this be send to the absent sitter so this proxy situation have set up at least a partial barrier between the medium s esp and the absent sitter s mind it be now hard to assume telepathy a a basis for the statement though research still do not know how far afield esp can range now the original absent sitter must decide whether the statement be meaningful to he here again laboratory approach be be evolve for it be recognize how elastic these reading can be how they can apply to many people and be often state in general term all too easily apply to any individual s own case if you look at a read mean for someone else you will probably see that many of the item could be consider a applicable to you even when you be not in the picture at all an interest sitter may think the sensitive have make a hit describe something accurately for he but can he really be sure that another sitter hear the same statement would not apply it subjectively to he own circumstance it be of course easy to see how j will mean uncle jack to one person and little jane to another a journey a little white house a change of outlook can apply to many people and even more complex item can be interpret to conform to one s own point of view which be by nature so personal one sitter may think a leather couch identify a read a surely direct to he to another it seem that nobody but he father ever use the phrase atta boy to get around this quite difficult corner there be one first aid to objectiveness prevent the distant sitter from know which read be for he if he be not tell which of four or five reading be mean for he he can more readily assess each item in a large frame do that statement really sound a if it be for i significant in i particular life or be i take something that could really apply to almost anybody and forget that many other people probably have have a similar experience conversely experimenter would consider a impressive such statement a the follow which if they turn out to be hit be so unusual a to be really significant he have four child two set of twin after be a lawyer for twenty-five year he start study for the ministry part of he house have be move to the other side of the road he die of typhoid in 1921 method have be develop of assign weight to statement that be it be know empirically that name begin with r be more common than those begin with z that fewer woman be name miranda than elizabeth that in the unite state more people die of heart disease than of smallpox so each read can be give a weight and each read a score by add up these weight specific date would be important a would double name various category have } be explore to find out about these empirical probability against which to measure the reading in the parapsychology foundation s long-range experiment reading be make by a variety of sensitive for a large number of cooperate sitter try to throw light on this question of the significance of mediumistic statement it be very important indeed in the field of extra-sensory perception and it relation to the survival hypothesis to know whether the statement be actually only those which any intuitive person might venture and an eager sitter attach to himself or on the other hand be unlikely fact be state fact which be in themselves significant and not easily applicable to everybody that be one thing the experiment be design to find out so after the sit have be hold several reading at one time be mail and the distant sitter whose name or whose communicator s name be give to the medium must mark each little item a correct hit incorrect miss doubtful or especially significant apply to he and he feel not to anyone else he be require to mark every item and to indicate which read he feel be actually he all these evaluation be then tot up and tabulate by add up the hit and significants with the weight place on those in the sitter s own read that be if he mark a most correct a read not mean for he the total experimental score fall conversely if he give a heavy rate to he own read and find more accurate fact in it than in the other a point be chalk up for the intrinsic objective meaningfulness of this type of mediumistic material and there be some positive result though the final finding will not be know for a long time and then far research can be formulate in another approach to the same procedure the content of the reading be analyze so a to see how the particular medium be likely to slant she statement do she often speak of location of cause of death do she accurately give date age kind of occupation it be possible to find out in which category most of she correct statement fall and where she make most of she hit now when so to speak the cream have be skim off and the item in the successful category separate out the sitter can be ask to consider and rate only this concentrate cream where the sensitive be at she good mediumistic impression be evidently of all sort and seem to involve all the sense i feel cold the medium say or i leg ach i head be heavy or perhaps she hear word or sound there s such a noise of loud machinery or i hear a child cry or he say we re all here and glad to see you maybe an entire scene come into consciousness with action and motion or a static view a house under a pine tree with a little stone path go up to the door the sensitive often seem to smell definite odor too or subjectively feel emotion sometimes she display amaze eidetic imagery and seem to see all detail in perspective a if the scene be actually there if press by the sitter for more detail she may be able to bring the picture more into focus and see more sharply almost a if she be physically go close if ask how she get she impression she probably can only say that she just get they some more vividly than other perhaps this be not so extraordinary after all even in normal experience one get impression without know exactly how of atmosphere of one another s personality mood intention of course there be an element of train here these gift people by concentration study guidance have learn to develop they power simply use it increase it intensity i be tell by one sensitive nor do a medium automatically know how to interpret she imagery impression often appear in a symbolic form and can not be take at face value it be apparently by symbol that the unconscious speak to the conscious and the medium have to translate these into mean if communication with an entity on the other side be take place this too may assume the form of clairvoyant symbolism during one read an image appear of a prisoner in iron but this do not necessarily refer to an actual jail take with other detail it could have refer to a state of mental or spiritual confinement in this connection it be worth note how name be sometimes obtain though they be often hear clairaudiently a if a voice be speak they in other case they be apprehend visually a symbol a slope to signify the name hill for instance one medium see two sheet flap on a line and find that the name shietz be significant to the sitter
