in the century from 1815 to 1914 the law of nation become international law several factor contribute to this change the congress of vienna be a convenient start point because it both epitomize and symbolize what be to follow here in 1815 the great nation assemble to legislate not merely for europe but for the world thus the congress mark a formal recognition of the political system that be central to world politics for a century international law have to fit the condition of europe and nothing that could not fit this system or the interest of the great european nation collectively could possibly emerge a law in any meaningful sense essentially this impose two condition first international law have to recognize and be compatible with an international political system in which a number of state be competitive suspicious and opportunistic in they political alignment with one another second it have to be compatible with the value system that they share in both respect international law be europeanized it be not always easy to develop theory and doctrine which would square the two condition on the one hand the major european nation have to maintain vis-a-vis each other an emphasis upon sovereignty independence formal equality thus insure for themselves individually an optimal freedom of action to maintain the flexibility of alignment that the system require and to avoid anything approach a repetition of the disastrous napoleonic experience but there be no press need to maintain these same standard with regard to most of the rest of the world thus theory and doctrine applicable among the great nation and the small european state do not really comfortably fit less develop and less powerful society elsewhere political interference in africa and asia and even in latin america though limit in latin america by the special interest of the unite state a express in the monroe doctrine itself from the outset relate to european politics and long dependent upon the balance of power system in europe be necessary in order to preserve both common economic value and the european balance itself a nation such a switzerland could be neutralize by agreement and could be rely upon to protect it neutrality more doubtful but possible with an assist from the north be the neutralization of the latin american country out of the question be the neutralization of asia and africa this europeanization of the law be make explicit by a number of 19th century scholar more emphasis be put upon the fact that international law be the law of civilize nation kent and story the great early american scholar repeatedly make use of this phrase or of christian nation which be a substantial equivalent wheaton state that the public law be essentially limit to the civilize and christian people of europe or to those of european origin of course it have always be of european origin in fact but it have maintain a universal outlook under the natural law theory now with virtually every writer not only be the european origin of public law acknowledge a a historical phenomenon but the rule thus establish by the advance civilization of europe be to be impose on other the european custom on which international law be base be to become by force and fiat the custom that other be to accept a law if they be to join this community a sovereign state hall for example be quite explicit on this point when he say state outside european civilization must formally enter into the circle of law-governed country they must do something with the acquiescence of the latter or some of they which amount to an acceptance of the law in it entirety beyond all possibility of misconstruction during the nineteenth century these view be protest by virtually all the latin american writer though ineffectively just a the new nation of africa and asia protest they with more effect today a number of other nineteenth-century development contribute to the transmutation of the law of nation into international law that be from aspect of a universal system of justice into particular rule govern the relation of sovereign state the difference be important for although the old law of nation do cover relationship among sovereign this be by no mean it exclusive domain the law of nature govern sovereign in they relationship to they own citizen to foreigner and to each other in a conceptually unify system the theory of international law which in the nineteenth century become common to virtually all writer in europe and america break this unity and this universality it lose sight of the individual almost entirely and confine itself to rule limit the exercise of state power for reason essentially unconnected with justice or morality save a these value might affect international relation no long do the sovereign look to the law of nation to determine what he ought to do he search be merely for rule that might limit he freedom of action to appreciate this development we must relate it to other aspect of nineteenth-century philosophy first and most obvious be the grow nationalism and the tendency to regard the state and the individual s identification with the state a transcend other tie of social solidarity national identification be not new but it be accelerate in intensity and scope throughout europe a new unifications occur it reach it ultimate philosophical statement in notion of state will put forward by the german especially by hegel although political philosopher will recognize it origin in the reject doctrine of hobbes national identification be reflect jurisprudentially in law theory which incorporate this hegelian abstraction and see law domestic and international simply a it formal reflection in the international community this reduce law to jellinek s auto-limitation a state the high form of human organization in fact and theory could be subject to law only by a manifestation of self-will or consent accord to the new theory the nineteenth century corporate sovereign be sovereign in a quite new and different sense from he historical predecessor he no long seek to find the law he make it he could be subject to law only because he agree to be there be no law domestic or international except that will by acknowledge by or consent to by state hide behind hegelian abstraction be more practical reason for a change jurisprudence relate to but distinguishable from nationalism be the growth of democracy in one form or another increase participation in politics and the demand of various group for status and recognition have dramatic effect upon law institution the effort of various interest group to control or influence governmental decision particularly when take in conjunction with the impact of industralization lead to a concentration of attention on the legislative power and the mean whereby policy could be formulate and enforce a law through bureaucratic institution law become a conscious process something more than simply do justice and look to local custom and a common morality for applicable norm particularly be this true when the norm previously apply be no long satisfactory to many when custom be rapidly change a the force of the new productivity be harness the old way of do thing which depend on a relatively stable community with stable idea deal with familiar situation be no long adequate to the task first be the period of codification of exist law the code napoleon in france and the peculiar codification that in fact result from austin s restatement and order of the common law in england codification be follow in all country by a grow amount of legislation some change and adjust the old law much deal with entirely new situation the legislative mill have be grind ever since and when it cumbersome process be no long adequate to the task a limit legislative authority be delegate in one form or another to the executive whereas the eighteenth century have be a time in which man seek justice the nineteenth and twentieth have be century in which man be satisfy with law indeed with develop positivism the separation of law from justice or from morality generally become quite specific in municipal system we tend to view what be call positivism a fundamentally a movement to democratize policy by increase the power of parliament the elect representative at the expense of the more conservative judiciary when the power of the latter be make both limit and explicit when norm be clarify and make more precise and the creation of new norm be place exclusively in parliamentary hand two purpose be serve government be make subservient to an institutionalize popular will and law become a rational system for implement that will for serve conscious goal for embody the public policy it be true that initially the task be to remove restriction that it be think inhibit the free flow of money goods and labor but even laissez-faire be a conscious policy law be see a an emanation of the sovereign will however the sovereign be not hobbes absolute monarch but rather the parliamentary sovereign of austin it be too an optimistic philosophy and though it separate law from morality it be by no mean an immoral or amoral one man through democratic institution of government and economic freedom be master of he destiny the theory do not require though it unfortunately might acquire a hegelian mystique it be merely a rationalization and order of new institution of popular government it be not oppose to either justice or morality it merely wish to minimize subjective view of official who wield public authority particularly be this true a laissez-faire capitalism become the dominant credo of western society to free the factor of production be a major objective of the rise bourgeoisie and this objective require that governmental authority administrative official and judge be limit a precisely and explicitly a possible that old custom which inhibit trade be abrogate that business be free from governmental supervision and notion of morality which might clog the automatic adjustment of the free market that obligation of status that be inconsistent with the new politics and the new economics be do away with contract conceive a the free bargain of formal equal replace the imply obligation of a more static and status-conscious society indeed contract be the dominant legal theme of the century the touchstone of the free society government itself be base upon contract business organization the corporation be analyze in contractual term trade be base on freedom of contract and money be lend and borrow on contractual term even marriage and the family be see a a contractual arrangement it be not surprise that the international obligation of state be also view in term of contract in fact some anzilotti be the principle example go so far a to say that all international law could be trace to the single legal norm pacta sunt servanda the displacement at least to a considerable extent of the ethical jurisprudence of the seventeenth and eighteenth century by positivism reshape both international law theory and doctrine in the first place the new doctrine bring a formal separation of international from municipal law reject the early view that both be part of a universal legal system one result be to nationalize much that have be regard a the law of nation admiralty law the law merchant and the host of problem which arise in private litigation because of some contact with a foreign country be all sever from the old law of nation and make dependent on the several national law private international law which american call the conflict of law be thus segregate from international law proper or a it be often call public international law state be free to enact within broad though perhaps determinate limit they own rule a to the application of foreign law by they court to vary the law merchant and to enact legislation with regard to many claim arise on the high sea the change be not quite so dramatic a it sound because in fact common norm continue to be invoke by municipal court and be only gradually change by legislation and then largely in marginal situation
