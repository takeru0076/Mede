this be the period during the melancholy day of autumn when university and college schedule what they call homecoming day they seek thereby to lure the old grad back to the old scene the football opponent on homecoming be of course select with the view that say opponent will have little more chance than do a christian when throw to one of the emperor s lion it be true of course the uncertainty of life be what they be that a now and then the christian kill the lion homecoming day have be ruine by a visit team even with all possible precaution homecoming be usually rather cruel and sad and only the perpetually ebullient and the continually optimistic be make happy by they more often than not a the old grad wander along the old path he memory of happy day when he strolled one of the path with a coed beside he become an ache and a pain he can smell again the perfume she wear and recall the lilt sound of laughter and can smell again the aroma of autumn fall leave the wine of cool air and the nostalgia of woodsmoke which blow through all the wind of fall undergraduate it be at precisely such moment that he encounter a couple of undergraduate face alight hold hand and talk happily a they come along oblivious of he or throw he the most fleet and casual of glance such a they would give a tether goat usually they titter loudly after they have pass by he dream go he feel suddenly the weight of the fat that be on he he bridgework or he plate feel loose and monstrous he bifocal blur he leg suddenly feel heavy and unaccountably weary a if he have walk for mile instead of stroll a few hundred yard along the old campus path bitterness come over he and the taste of time be like unripe persimmons in he mouth it be not much good if he meet with old classmate too often unless he hail they they pass he by he recall with a wry smile the wit who say on return from a homecoming reunion that he would never go again because all he class have change so much they do nt even recognize he if they do meet and recognize one another slap back and embrace the moment soon be do after all when one have ask whatever become of old joe and charlie when one have inquire who it be sue brown marry and where it be they now live when question be ask and answer about family and child and old professor when the game and it probable outcome have be exhaust that do it middle-aged spread by then one begin to notice the middle-age spread the gray hair the eyeglass body that be too thin or too heavy the fade sign of old beauty the athlete of by-gone year who wear a size 46 suit and puff when he have finish a sentence of any length then it be time to break it up and move on it be if anything bad on the old player he sit in the stand and he do nt like that enough of he life be spend there on the field for he never to like watch the game a a spectator in the crowd he always feel lonely a team feel something on a team a man feel he be a part of it and akin to the man next to he in the stand he be lonely and lose no matter how many be about he he sit there remember the tense moment before the ball be snap the churn of strain foot the rasp of the canvas pants the smell and feel of hot wet woolen sleeve across he face he remember the desperate pant breath the long run on the kick-off the hard jolt tackle the breakthrough the desperate agony of goal-line stand and so he squirm with each play remember he youth but it be no use it be go no matter how often a man go back to the scene of he youth and strength they can never be recapture again since the obvious be not always true the republican national committee wisely analyze it defeat of last autumn and find that it occur a suspect in the large city of 40 city with population of 300000 and more mr kennedy carry 26 and mr nixon 14 there be eight state in which the large urban vote can be the balance of power in any close election these be new york pennsylvania michigan maryland missouri new jersey illinois and minnesota in 1952 mr eisenhower win all but missouri yet in 1960 all eight give majority to mr kennedy republican research break down the vote in philadelphia mr nixon despite a very earnest effort to capture the minority group fail to do so he visit to warsaw poland after the russian journey in the summer of 1959 be expect to win the polish vote which in several city be substantial yet the gop breakdown discover that in philadelphia mr nixon receive but 21 per cent of the so-called polish vote 30 per cent of the irish vote and 18 per cent of the negro vote task force a gop task force committee will seek to find out how it party may win support from the ethnic and minority group in city the task force might make a start in washington with republican congressional leader these gentleman already have do the party harm by they seem reluctance to vote aid for the depress area and by they criticism of mr kennedy for talk about a recession and unemployment this error be compound by declare the recession to be a statistical one and not a reality the almost six million person without job and the two million work part-time do not consider themselves and they plight a statistical they do not view the tour of the distress city and town by secretary of labor goldberg a politics which the gop declare it to be the people visit be glad to have a government with heart enough to take an interest in they misery senator mundt s gross distortion of president eisenhower s conversation into a denunciation of president kennedy a too leave wing a statement mr eisenhower declare to be entirely false be another case in point if the republican and southern democrat join to defeat medical care for the old under the social security program they will thereby erect still another barrier to gop hope in the city error repeat the present republican leadership a practice by mundt goldwater bridge dirksen et al be repeat the error of the party leadership of the 1930s in that decade the partisan zeal to defend mr hoover and the party s failure to anticipate or cope with the depression cause a great majority of american to see the republican party a cold and lack in any sympathy for the problem of human being catch up in the distress and suffer bring on by the economic crash the republican party be not lack in humanity but it permit it extremely partisan leadership to make it appear devoid of any consideration for people in trouble farmer call they mule-drawn pickup truck hoover cart smoker reduce to the making speak of the sack tobacco a hoover dust one may be sure the present republican congressional leadership have nt mean to repeat this error but it be in the process of so do because it apparently give priority to try to downgrade john f kennedy that this be not good politics be underscore by the late poll figure which show that 72 per cent of the people like the way in which the new president be conduct the nation s business the most articulate republican be those who in they desire to get back at mr kennedy already have create the image of a republican leadership which be reluctant to assist the distress and the unemployed and which be even more unwilling to help old people who need medical care if they also defeat the school bill the gop task force will nt have much research to do it will early know why the party will nt win back city vote the 1962 general assembly have important business to consider the tragedy be that it will not be able to transact that business in any responsible manner after the griffin-byrd political troup have complete the circuit in november in the name of a pre-legislative forum this be go to be the most politically orient legislature in history every legislator from brasstown bald to folkston be go to have he every vote subject to the close scrutiny a a test of he political allegiance not he conviction hoped-for legislative action on adjustment of the county unit system stand less chance than ever and just how far can the legislature go toward set up a self-insurance system for the state in the midst of a governor s race how unpartisan will be the recommendation of lt gov garland byrd s senate committee on government operation the situation already be bad because the legislature move the governor s race forward a few month cause the campaign to get start early than usual but when former gov marvin griffin and lt gov byrd accept the invitation of the georgia state chamber of commerce to join the tour next november the situation be aggravate neither have a choice other than to accept the invitation to have refuse would have be political suicide and it may be that one or both man actually welcome the opportunity when the bravado comment be cast aside the georgia state chamber of commerce try to guard against the danger of eliminate potential candidate it want the state democratic executive committee to pick the serious candidate but state party chairman jame gray of albany say no and he do nt mince any word they be just ask too much he say we can nt think of anyone else who would want to separate serious candidate from other candidate either there be other danger politics be an accelerate game if an opponent accuse you of lie do nt deny it say he be a horse thief run an old adage these man be spender if either one ever start make promise there be no tell where the promise would end griffin s rural road authority and byrd s 60000 mile of county contract would look like pauper s oath the trouble be that at first glance the idea look like such a good one why not have they travel the state in november debate it would present a forum for they in almost every community but far think bring the shuddery vision of a governor s race be run in the next legislature the spectre of big spend program the ooze of mudslinging before the campaign should even begin there be a way out of this the chamber have not arrange a pre-legislative forum it have arrange a campaign for governor if it will simply delay the debate until the qualification be close next spring and then carry all the candidate on a tour of debate it can provide a service to the state but the legislature should be grant the opportunity to complete it work before choose up side for the race former british prime minister attlee say eisenhower be not a great soldier ike s somewhat like george washington both win a pretty fair-sized war with a modest assist from british strategy congressman return from recess say the people admire president kennedy so much they re even will to heed he call to sacrifice and give up he program slogan of the john birch society paddle you own canoe the guy who make the motor boat may be a communist a republican survey say kennedy win the 60 election on the religious issue too many people be afraid if the gop win they d have to spend all they time pray
