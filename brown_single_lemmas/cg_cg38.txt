they expectation of regain control of the government they delight at the prospect of a new war they hope of have the tory hang and so on a for the author of the englishman mrs manley sarcastically deplore that the sole defense of the protestant cause should be leave to ridpath dick steele and they associate with the apostle of young man s coffee-house another controversy typical of the war between the englishman and the examiner center on robert late viscount molesworth a whig leader in ireland and a member of the irish privy council on december 21 the day that the irish house of commons petition for removal of sir constantine phipps they tory lord chancellor molesworth reportedly make this remark on the defense of phipps by convocation they that have turn the world upside down be come hither also upon complaint from the low house of convocation to the house of lords he be remove from the privy council he remark have be represent a a blasphemous affront to the clergy steele who have early praise molesworth in tatler no 189 now defend he in englishman no 46 depict he removal a a setback to the constitution on the other hand molesworth be naturally assail in the tory press swift in the dublin edition of a preface to the bishop of sarum s introduction indicate he feeling by include molesworth along with toland tindal and collins in the group of those who like burnet be engage in attack all convocation of the clergy in the same way he couple molesworth and wharton in a letter to archbishop king and he have early describe he a the bad of they in some observation on the irish privy council submit to oxford a month late in the publick spirit of the whig he use steele s defense of molesworth a evidence of he disrespect for the clergy call steele s position an affront to the whole convocation of ireland on this issue then a on so many in these month steele and swift take rigidly oppose point of view in the early month of 1714 the battle between swift and steele over the issue of the succession enter it major phase the preliminary end with the publication of steele s crisis on january 19 and from that point on the fight proceed at a rapid pace in answer to the crisis swift produce the publick spirit of the whig he most extensive and bitter attack on he old friend by this time a we shall see the tory be already plan to punish steele for he political write by expel he from the house of commons despite he defense of himself in the final paper of the englishman and in he speech before the house they effort be successful steele lose he seat in parliament and he personal quarrel with swift by now a public issue thus reach it climax of all the whig tract write in support of the succession the crisis be perhaps the most significant certainly it be the most pretentious and elaborate hanoverian agent assist in promote circulation say to have reach 40000 and if one may judge by the reaction of swift and other government writer the work must have have considerable impact steele s main business here be to arouse public opinion to the immediate danger of a stuart restoration to this end the first and long section of the tract cite all the law enact since the revolution to defend england against the arbitrary power of a popish prince in he comment on these law steele sound all the usual note of current whig propaganda range from a criticism of the tory peace to an attack on the dismissal of marlborough but he principal theme be that the intrigue of the tory we popish or jacobite party pose an immediate threat to church and state like burnet he deplore the indifference of the people in the face of the crisis treasonable book strike at the hanoverian succession he complain be allow to pass unnotice in this connection swift too be draw in for attack the author of the conduct of the ally have dare to drop insinuation about alter the succession in he effort to stir the public from it lethargy steele go so far a to list catholic atrocity of the sort to be expect in the event of a stuart restoration and with rouse rhetoric he assert that the only preservation from these terrours be to be find in the law he have so tediously cite it be no time he write to talk with hint and innuendo but openly and honestly to profess we sentiment before we enemy have compleat and put they design in execution against we steele apparently profess he sentiment in this book too openly and honestly for he own good since the government be soon to use it a evidence against he in he trial before the house in the final issue of the englishman which end just a the new session of parliament begin he provide he enemy with still more ammunition for example no 56 print the patent give the electoral prince the title of duke of cambridge in a few month the duke be to be the center of a controversy of some significance on the touchy question of the protestant succession at the order of the dowager electress the hanoverian agent support by the whig leader demand that a writ of summon be issue which would call the duke to england to sit in parliament thus far insure the succession by establish a hanoverian prince in england before the queen s death anne be furious and bolingbroke advise that the request be refuse oxford realize that the law require the issuance of the writ take the opposite view for which the queen never forgive he accordingly the request be grant but the elector himself who have not be consult by he mother reject the proposal and recall he agent schutz whose impolitic handle of the affair have cause the hanoverian interest to suffer and have make oxford s dismissal more likely than ever steele in this paper be indicate he sympathy for such a plan a few day after this englishman appear defoe report to oxford that steele be expect to move in parliament that the duke be call over defoe then comment if they could draw that young gentleman into they measure they would show themselves quickly for they be not asham d to say they want only a head to make a begin the final issue of the englishman no 57 for february 15 run to some length and be print a a separate pamphlet entitle the englishman be the close of the paper so-called steele s purpose be to present a general defense of he political write and a resume of the theme which have occupy he in the englishman but there be much here also which bear directly on he personal quarrel with swift thus he complain with considerable justice that the tory writer have resort to libel instead of answer he argument he birth education and fortune he say have all be ridicule simply because he have speak with the freedom of an englishman and he assure the reader that whoever talk with i be speak to a gentleman bear a notable example of this abuse he quote passage from the examiner that destroyer of all thing and the character of richard steele which he here attribute to swift though put in rather maudlin term steele s defense of himself have a reasonable basis he point be simply that the tory have shower he with personal satire despite the fact that a a private subject he have a right to speak on political matter without affront the prerogative of the sovereign he claim too that he political conviction be simply those which be call revolution principle and which be accept by moderate man in both party the final section of this pamphlet be of special interest in a consideration of steele s relation with swift it purport to be a letter from steele to a friend at court who in miss blanchard s opinion could only be mean a swift steele first answer briefly the charge which he dear old friend have make about he pamphlet on dunkirk and he crisis then he launch into an attack on the tory minister whom he call the new convert by this term he mean to ridicule they profession of act in the interest of the church despite they own education and manner of life a gibe in other word at the presbyterianism in harley s family and at bolingbroke s repute impiety the tory leader he insinuate be cynically use the church a a political by-word to increase party friction and keep themselves in power this be the principal point make in this final section of englishman no 57 and it cap steele s effort in he other write of these month to counteract the notion of the tory a a church party support by the body of the clergy next steele turn he attention to the courtier he be address he explain that there be sometimes honorable courtier but that too often a man who succeed at court do not hesitate to sacrifice he sovereign and nation to he own avarice and ambition such he imply be the case with he friend who be not really a new convert himself but merely a favorer of new convert if jack the courtier be really to be take a swift the follow remark be obviously steele s comment on swift s change of party and it effect on they friendship i assure you dear jack when i first find out such an allay in you a make you of so malleable a constitution that you may be work into any form an artificer please i foresee i should not enjoy you favour much long he close he letter by demand that dunkirk be demolish that the pretend be force to move far away from the coast of england and that the queen and the house of hanover come to a good understand the last point be soon to be include in the seditious remark use against he in parliament the examiner during steele s trial a month late print an answer from the courtier address to r s at button s coffee-house he review steele s entrance into politics and find that he present difficulty be due to he habit of attribute to he own ability and talent achievement which more properly should be credit to the indulgence of he friend once more in other word steele be say to be indebted to swift for he wit this be the form in which they private feud most often appear in the tory press especially the examiner in the publick spirit of the whig it may be note swift himself contemptuously dismiss steele s reference to he friend at court i suppose by the style of old friend and the like it must be some body there of he own level among whom he party have indeed more friend than i could wish on february 16 steele take he seat in parliament by now he be undergo a fresh torrent of abuse from tory paper and pamphlet and action be be take to effect he punishment by expulsion from parliament on the very day that the parliamentary session begin another infamous libel appear entitle a letter from the facetious dr andrew tripe at bath to the venerable nestor ironside it be fill with the usual personal abuse of steele especially of he physical appearance in the open paragraph too steele be accuse of extreme egotism of give himself the preference to all the learn he contemporary from dr swift himself even down to poet crspe of the customhouse
