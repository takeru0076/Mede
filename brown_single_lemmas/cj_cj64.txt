if one characteristic distinguish boris godunov it be the consistency with which every person on the stage include the chorus come alive in the music much of this lifelike quality result from mussorgsky s care in base he vocal line on natural speech inflection in this he follow a path that lead back to the very source of opera such composer a monteverdi lully and purcell with the same goal in mind have develop style of recitative sensitively attune to they own language through long experimentation in he song mussorgsky develop a russian recitative a different from other a the language itself give most of he musical continuity to the orchestra he let the speech fall into place a if by coincidence but control the pace and emphasis of the word the moment of sing melody in the usual sense come most often when the character be actually suppose to be sing a in folk song and liturgical chant otherwise mussorgsky reserve he vocal melody for prolong expression of emotion boris first monologue for example even then the flexibility of the phrase suggest that the word come first in importance aside from boris himself one need but examine the secondary role to place mussorgsky among the master of musical portraiture even those who appear in only one or two scene be full personality define with economical precision consider the four monk who figure prominently in the action piman varlaam missail and the jesuit rangoni under no circumstance could we mistake one for the other each musical set have an individual touch piman be an old man weak in body he voice rarely rise to a full forte but firm and clear of mind he calmness offer contrast to grigori s youthful excitement a quiet but sturdy theme somewhat folklike in character appear whenever the old monk speak of the history he be record or of he own past life this theme come to represent the outer world the realm of battle and banquet see from a distance quite distinct from the quiet spiritual life in the monastery it change and develop accord to the text it introduce piman when he come before boris in the last act once he have be identify however a new melody be use to accompany he narrative a bleak motif with barren octave create a rather ancient effect an imaginative storyteller piman take on the character he describe a if he be experience the old shepherd s blindness and miraculous cure here the composer use a favorite device of he the intensification of the mood through key relationship the original d minor seem to symbolize blindness inescapable in spite of all attempt to move away from it a the child address the shepherd in a dream light in the form of the major mode begin to appear and at the moment of the miracle we hear a clear and shine d major varlaam and missail always appear together and often sing together in a straightforward rhythmically vigorous idiom that distinguish they from the more subtle and well-educated piman they beg song might easily be a folk melody the same could be say for the song to which they make they entrance in the final scene apparently they origin be humble they approach to life direct and unsophisticated whatever learn they may have have in they order do nt disturb they now missail be the straight man not very talkative mild-mannered when he do speak varlaam be loud rowdy uninhibited in he pleasure and impatient with anyone who be not the same a rough ostinato figure hear first in the introduction to the inn scene characterize he amusingly and reappear whenever he come into the action the song of kazan in which this figure become a wild-sounding accompaniment fill in the picture of undisciplined high spirit the phrase be irregular and the abrupt key change have a primitive forcefulness we can imagine how they startle audience of the 1870 s varlaam s music begin to ramble a he feel the effect of the wine but he pull himself together when the need arise both monk respond to the guard s challenge with a few phrase of they beg song a clever naturalistic touch be varlaam s labored read of the warrant a the knack gradually come back to he he rhythm become steady with the rigid monotony of an unskilled reader for the only time in the opera word be not set accord to they natural inflection to do so would have spoil the dramatic point of the scene musically and dramatically rangoni be a far remove from the conventional monk a varlaam he music show a sensuality couple with an eerie quality that suggest somehow a blood-kinship with dappertutto in offenbach s hoffman he speech show none of the native accent of the russian character in spite of the italian name he sound french he personality appear more strike by contrast with marina who be perhaps purposely rather superficially characterize rangoni s first entrance be a musical shock a sudden open fifth in a key totally unrelated to what have precede it the effect be a if he have materialize out of nowhere he speak quietly conceal he authority beneath a smooth humility just a the shift harmony that accompany he all but hide the firm pedal point beneath they he address marina with great deference call she princess at first it be only after he have involve she emotion in he scheme that he use she give name place himself by implication in the position of a solicitous father curiously this scene be a close parallel to one that verdi be write at the same time the scene between amonasro and aida rangoni and amonasro have the same purpose force the girl to charm the man she love into serve she country s cause and they tactic be much the same rangoni begin by describe the sad state of the church this bring a reaction of distress from marina the music become ethereal a he call up a vision of she own sainthood it be she he tell she who can bring the truth to russia and convert the heretic a if in a trance she repeat he word then realize with a shock she own audacity this be no assignment for a frivolous girl she assure he now rangoni come to the point and we hear for the first time a long downward chromatic scale that will become the characteristic motif of he sinister power it be a phrase a arrest a a magician s gesture with a piquant turn of harmony give an effect of strangeness another theme sinuously chromatic appear a he direct she to gain power over grigori by any mean even at the cost of she honor come from a priest the music sound a odd a the advice marina rebel at this suggestion she pride be a much at stake a she virtue she be the unattainable beauty the princess who turn away suitor by the dozen indignantly she denounce rangoni for he evil thought and order he to leave she at once the jesuit pull out all the stop to music of a menace darkness he describe the power of satan gain control of the girl poison she soul with pride and destroy she beauty the combine threat of hell-fire and ugliness be too much for she and she fall terrify at he foot with another sudden change of mood he be again calm and protective exhort she to trust and obey he a god s spokesman and the chromatic scale descend in ominous contradiction whatever the source of rangoni s power marina be he captive now we be remind of this at the end of the next scene when he theme cut through the warmth of the love duet again throw a chill over the atmosphere the most unusual feature of boris however be the use of the great character of all the chorus this be the real protagonist of the drama the conflict be not boris versus grigori or shuiski or even the ghost of the murder child but boris versus the russian people mussorgsky make this quite clear by the extent to which choral scene propel the action boris first entrance seem almost a footnote to the splendor of the coronation scene with it dazzle confusion of tonality we have a brief glimpse of the tsar s public personality the official boris but we real focus be on the excitement of the crowd a significant contrast with it halfhearted acclamation in the open scene it bitter resentment and fury in the final act one reason for the unique vitality of the chorus be it great variety in expression it rarely speak a a unit even in it most conventional appearance the guest song of praise to marina there be a few female dissenter criticize the princess for she coldness in many passage for example the council of boyar each section of the chorus become a character group with a particular opinion hot argument arise between tenor and bass who will sing in harmony only when they agree on an idea the open scene show this method at it most individual mussorgsky paint a tell picture of the common people those who must suffer the effect of they ruler struggle for power without understand the cause they be hold in control by force but barely they will kneel and plead for boris leadership in a strangely intense song it phrase irregularly break a if gasp for breath but when the police with they cudgel move away they mock and grumble and fight among themselves there be a quick change from the plaintive song to a conversational tone hey mityukh ask one group what be we shout about and mityukh apparently the intellectual leader of the crowd reply that he have no notion the joke and argument grow loud until the police return then the people strike up they song with even more fervor than before end it with a wail of despair mussorgsky frequently use liturgical music with considerable dramatic force in piman s cell the soft prayer of the monk hear from offstage not only help to set the scene but emphasize the contrast between young grigori s thought and he situation this be especially strike between piman s quiet exit and grigori s vehement outburst against boris again a boris feel himself near death a procession file into the hall sing a hymn it modal harmony add a churchly touch to the grim atmosphere the word be hardly calculate to put the tsar s mind at ease they echo the word with which he have describe he own vision of the die child who tremble and beg for mercy and there be no mercy the live a well a the dead now accuse he this final reminder of he guilt be the fatal one one of the outstanding asset of the present production be the restoration of the st basil s scene usually omit from performance and rarely include in a publish score though brief it have a sharp dramatic edge and great poignancy in addition it be an important link in the plot give we a reveal glimpse of the people s attitude toward boris and the false dimitri the mayhem in the forest of kromy be a natural sequel the st basil s scene open with little group of beggar mill around the square the ever present police keep they under scrutiny in the orchestra we hear first a hush hesitant pizzicato figure then the insistent police motif a it appear in the open scene the service be over and a number of people come from the church with they spokesman mityukh in the lead they bring the news that the pretend have be excommunicate this be meet with scorn by the hearer who claim that mityukh be lie or drink mussorgsky cleverly contrast the two group by they orchestral accompaniment solemn chord or mock staccatos there be still more news mityukh announce they have pray for the soul of the tsarevich
