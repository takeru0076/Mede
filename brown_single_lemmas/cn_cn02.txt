the lamp still burn in the house into the darkness thirty-five they ride at a measure pace through the valley dawn would come soon and the night be at it cold the moon have sink below the black crest of the mountain and the land see through eye that have grow accustom to the absence of light look primeval a if no man have ever trespass before it look a gavin have first see it year ago on those night when he sleep alone by he campfire and wake suddenly to the hoot of an owl or the rustle of a blade of grass in the moon s wind a savage land untenanted and brood too strong to be break by the will of man gavin sigh bitterly in that inert landscape the caravan of he desire pass before he mind he see they ambush strew in the posture of the break and the die in vain he mind grope to reassemble the bone of the relationship he have seek so desperately but they would not come to life the silence oppress he make he bend low over the horse s neck a if to hide from a wind that have begin to blow far away and be twist slowly through the darkness in it slow search they pass ranch that be frame dark gray against the black hill then at last the darkness begin to dissolve a bold line of violet break loose from the high ridge of the mountain follow by feather of red that sweep the last star from the sky the wan light spread over the ground and the valley reveal in the first glimmer the contour of tree and fence and palely shadow gully they have be see a soon a they leave the ranch pick out of the darkness by the weary though watchful eye of two man post a few hundred yard away in the windless shelter of the tree the two man whip they horse into town and fling themselves up the step of the saloon cry they intelligence the man in pettigrew s be tire from a night s drink they face red and baggy but the liquor have flush they courage they greet the news angrily a though they have be cheat of purpose lester hear they mutter see they eye reveal they desire he work he tongue

the thing they would do wild to break from the cloy warmth of the saloon into the cold of the eb night he flee through the door and down the step run and the man grunt and follow push lester to one side where he back against the wall with the sleeve of he jacket raise before he eye to shut out the light purvis and silas pettigrew be the last to leave they mount up and ride slowly behind the other at a safe distance thirty-six in the cold dawn the mist swirl low to the ground then rise with a gust of sudden wind to leave the valley clear the cloud part and hard gash of sunlight swoop down to stain the earth with streak of white and gold light so that the shadow of the run horse flow like dark stream over the dazzle snow when they turn in the saddle they could see the man behind they string out on the prairie in a flat black line the wind of they run be cold and wild the horse be lather and they mane stream like stiff black pennant in the wind the mare begin to tire and clayton feel the spray of snow from the hoof of gavin s stallion he look over he shoulder at the thin dot of pursuer they neither gain nor fall back he ride low on the mare s neck ahead of he gavin turn slightly off the trail and point for the gap no more than a mile away gavin s face be bloodless with excitement he do not look back he could feel more than hear the staccato beat of hoof that fan out across the prairie to the north he know who be ride after he the man he have know all he life the man who have work for he swear they loyalty to he now they be ride to kill he and he be flee run flee he death and he life at the same time the land over which he speed be the land he have create and live in he valley with every leap stride of the horse beneath he he cross one more patch of earth that have be he that he would never see again the gap loom before he the place where have confront jack english on that day so many year ago be he exit from all that have mean to he california be too far he think he would never reach california he be too old when he pass up and through the corridor of pine that line the trail he could see ahead he be pass from life
