a man with a sketch pad in hand sit with a large pink woman in a small office at the end of a long dim corridor and make pencil line on paper and say be this more like it mrs macready or be the eyebrow more like this when he have finish with that he would go to another part of the hotel and say much the same thing to someone else most probably a busboy begin to look like he now would you say different about the mouth huh more like this maybe man blow dust on object in a room on the seventeenth floor of the hotel dumont and blow it off again and do the same in a tiny almost airless room in a tenement in the west forties and man also use vacuum cleaner in both room suck dust up once more man from the third detective district eighteenth precinct have the long the most tedious job at the hotel dumont there have at the time in issue be twenty-three overnighters count couple a singular these include a one mr and mrs anthony payne who have check in a little after noon the day before and have not check out together but gardner willing be not include he have be at the dumont for almost a week there be of course no special reason to believe that the man or woman they seek have stay only overnight at the hotel the twenty-three or twenty-two with the paynes themselves omit provide merely a place to start and they identification be the bare of start with name and address list verification come next it would take time it would almost inevitably trouble some water i certainly be not at the dumont last night and i husband could nt have be he s in boston of course he s in the hotel king arthur across the street provide almost twice a many problem the king arthur offer respectable and convenient lodgings to people from the suburb who want to see a show and do nt want heaven know do nt want to lunge anxiously through crowd street to railroad station and at odd hour of night drive from small station to distant home probably through rain or in november something bad the king arthur be less expensive than the dumont the king arthur have fifty-four overnighters again count room rather than people check the overnighters out fail to find what be want a be most likely check out other guest with special but not exclusive attention to those with room on the street anyone active enough can reach a roof wherever he room may be and know while all this go on that there be no real reason to suppose that the murderer have be a guest in either hotel it be not even certain the shoot have be fire from either hotel there be other roof less convenient but not impossible it be dull business detect and hard on foot there be also the one salient question to ask and ask widely do you notice anything out of the way like for example a man carry a twenty-two rifle probably with a telescopic sight attach there be of course no hope it really would be that simple the sniper whether psychopathic marksman or murderer by intent would hardly have walk to he vantage point with rifle over shoulder whistle a march tune anybody carry anything that might hide a rifle long thin suitcase or long fat suitcase for that matter shrug meet that from room clerk from bellhop who measure but nothing it appear long enough to attract attention case say for musical instrument none note at the dumont several at the king arthur a combo be stay there and have be for a week anything else anything at all shrug meet that detective pearson eighteenth precinct think for a time he might be on to something a refuse bin at the dumont turn up a florist s box a very long box for very long-stemmed flower trace of oil on green tissue the lab to check the lab sorry no oil anything at all strange well a man have try at the king arthur to register with an ocelot at the dumont a guest have come in a collapsible wheel chair at the king arthur one guest have have he head heavily bandage and another have a bandage foot and have walk with crutch there have also be a man who must have have st vitus or something because he keep jerk he head a report dribble in william weigand toss they into the centrifuge which have become he head mullins come in there be no sign of mrs lauren payne at she house on nod road ridgefield connecticut the house be modern large on five acre must have cost plenty the state cop would check from time to time pass word when there be word to pass weigand toss this news into the centrifuge sort thing out damn it sort out the next move try to forget motive for the moment consider opportunity only those actually with payne when he be shoot or who have leave the party within not more than five minute make five arbitrary positively have none the norths hathaway jerry s publicity director livingston birdwood producer of uprising they have be with payne when he be shoot could not therefore have shoot he from above take gardner willing he have leave after the scuffle have be see to leave he would have have ample time to go into a blind somewhere and wait he prey consider he seriously therefore intangible enter then hunch which feel like fact willing would ambush certainly willing undoubtedly have willing be presumably a good than average shoot but hunch now willing would not ambush anything which go on two leg instead of four because if for no other reason willing would never for a moment suppose he be not big tough than anything else that go on two leg ambush be lay by those who doubt themselves a any man may against a tiger faith constable have have to go on from the party and have presumably go on to be check out far forget motive no motive be a part of fact nobody in he right mind punish a quarter-century-old dereliction grudge simply do not keep that well in a sane mind faith constable have accomplish much in a quarter of a century jeopardize it now to correct so old a wrong bill shake he head also he think i doubt if she could hit the side of a barn with a shotgun lauren herself she have leave the party early plead a headache no lack of opportunity presume she have a gun she might conceivably have bring one in in a large-enough suitcase check on the payne luggage she might now have take it away again motive she husband wander bitter unreasoning jealousy heaven know it happen and hell know it too but it happen almost always among the primitive and usually among the very young call it mentally young call it retard there be nothing to indicate that lauren payne be primitive she do not move in primitive circle she be young but not that young it occur to bill weigand that he be on a hunch basis eliminate a good many he remind himself that all elimination be tentative he also remind himself that he have an unusual number of possibility the mason mother or son or mother and son opportunity be obvious motive here too the cause to hate lie well back in the year but bitterness have more cause to remain even increasingly to corrode with the boy particularly the boy have apparently if mrs macready be right in what she have tell mullins only in recent month be force to give up college to work a a busboy see the man he blame for this make much of youth and bitterness and bill pick up the telephone get mullins send out a pickup on mrs mason and the boy when you ve get enough to go on bill say right mullins would do a man name lar simon playwright-director have express a wish that anthony payne drop dead he would say of course that he have not really have any such wish that what he have say be no more than one of those thing one do say lightly mean nothing which probably would turn out to be true which he obviously have to be give the opportunity to say a man name blaine smythe with y and e but pronounce without they have be fire at payne s insistence he be also if pam north be right a close acquaintance of lauren payne s than she now be incline to admit he might deny the latter would certainly deny any connection between the two thing or any connection of either with murder he would have to be give the opportunity mullins it be evident that mullins be the man to go it be evident that a captain should remain at he desk direct with a firm hand and keep a firm seat bill weigand be good and tire of the wall opposite and the crack in the plaster let mullins keep the firm seat let stein when siamese cat be intertwine it be difficult to tell where one leave off and another begin stilt and shadow on pam s bed appear to be one cat rather large a siamese cat go and to be sure have two head and two tail on the other hand they or it seem to have no leg whatever pamela north say hi to she cat and add that proper cat meet they human at the door of four dark word ear one twitch slightly at this all right pam say i know it be nt dinnertime but at this the one too-large cat suddenly become two cat stretch shadow the more talkative begin at once to talk she voice piteous stilt a more direct cat leap from the bed and trot briskly toward the kitchen shadow look surprise wail and trot after she the hell it be nt dinnertime two wave tail tell pam north it be not whatever tale be tell by tail martha presumably would cope she might be firm it be most unlikely that she would be firm they want to be fat cat pam think and light a cigarette and lean back on a chaise and consider pull she thought together after a time it occur to she that she thought be not worth the trouble a vague feel that anthony payne have have it come be hardly a think and be in any event reprehensible have faith constable s explanation of she confidence so uninvited be a little thin that be more like a think but not a great deal more have that tall dark boy carry tray too heavy for he find what he might have consider adulation of a man he probably hate more than he could bear and possess himself how of a rifle and kill pam find she have no answer have only a hope the poor kid the poor frail kid some people have luck and some have no luck and that whatever people who prefer order say be the size of it the poor unlucky the telephone ring pam realize to she surprise that she have be almost doze at four oclock in the afternoon two martini for lunch that be the trouble i ought to remember do nt pretend you do remember you just hello yes this be she what the voice have music in it even with word come too fast they come on the music of the voice i say i would pam say they will nt talk about who give the information not unless they have to they do nt mrs constable not unless they have she be interrupt call this a cry for help faith constable say
