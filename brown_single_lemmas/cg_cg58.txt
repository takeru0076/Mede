november 17th cornwallis and 2000 man have leave philadelphia with the object of capture fort mercer at red bank new jersey in order to prevent this washington hasten to dispatch several unit to reinforce the fort include a force under the marquis de lafayette contain some 160 of morgan s rifleman all who be fit for duty at this time the rest have no shoe although the fort be evacuate in the face of the force of cornwallis morgan and he man do have a chance to take another swing at the redcoat a picket guard of about 350 mostly hessian be attack by the american under lafayette and drive back to they camp some twenty to thirty of they fall before the rifleman s fire i never see man lafayette declare in regard to the rifleman so merry so spirit and so desirous to go on to the enemy whatever force they might have a that small party in this fight nathanael greene tell washington that lafayette be charm with the spirit behavior of the militia and rifleman a few day late it be learn that general howe be plan an attack upon the american camp the british general move he force north from philadelphia to chestnut hill near the right wing of the patriot encampment here the pennsylvania militia skirmish with the british but soon flee morgan be order to attack the enemy who have meantime move to edge hill on the leave of the american similar order be give to the maryland militia morgan immediately dispose he troop for action and find he have not long to wait a body of redcoat be see march down a nearby slope a tempt target for the rifleman who throw a volley into they rank and mess up the smart formation considerably now the rifleman and the marylanders follow up they begin and close in on the british give they another tell round of fire the redcoat run like rabbit but the maryland militia have likewise flee all too typical of this type of soldier during the revolution an experience which give morgan little confidence in militia in general a he watch other instance of they break in hot engagement the british although suffer considerable loss note the defection of the marylanders make a stand then turn and attack morgan who become greatly outnumber and have to retire the american lose forty-four man among they major joseph morris of morgan s regiment an officer who be regard with high esteem and affection not only by he commander but by washington and lafayette a well the latter be so upset on learn of the death of morris that he write morgan a letter show he own warmhearted generosity after compliment morgan and the rifleman and say he be praise they to congress too the ardent frenchman add he feel that congress should make some financial restitution to the widow and family of morris but that he know morgan realize how long such action usually require if it be do at all a mrs morris may be in some want before that time lafayette continue i be go to trouble you with a commission which i beg you will execute with the great secrecy if she want to borrow any sum of money in expect the arrangement of congress it would not become a strange unknown to she to offer himself for that purpose but you could a from yourself tell she that you have friend who be with the army do nt know what to do with they money and would willingly let she have one or many thousand dollar this be accordingly do and the plight of the grateful mrs morris be much relieve a a result of the generous loan the amount of which be not know apparently still sensitive about the idea with which general gate have approach he at saratoga namely that george washington be replace morgan be vehement in he support of the commander-in-chief during the campaign around philadelphia richard peter secretary of the board of war think morgan be so extreme on the subject that he accuse he of try to pick a quarrel morgan hotly deny this and inform the board of war that the man in camp link the name of peter with the plot against washington peter insist that this impression be a great misunderstanding and evidently from the quarrel obtain an unfavorable impression of morgan s judgment such a situation regard the board of war could hardly have help morgan s chance for promotion when that matter come before the group late on in late december the american army move from whitemarsh to valley forge and although the distance be only 13 mile the journey take more than a week because of the bad weather the barefooted and almost naked man the position of the new camp be admirably select and well fortify it easily defensible nature be one good reason why howe do not attack it besides help to prevent the movement of the british to the west valley forge also obstruct the trade between howe s force and the farmer thus threaten the vital subsistence of the redcoat and render they forage to obtain necessary supply extremely hazardous in order to see that this hinder situation remain effective washington detach several body of he troop to the periphery of the philadelphia area morgan and he corps be place on the west side of the schuylkill river with instruction to intercept all supply find go to the city and to keep a close eye on the movement of the enemy the headquarters of morgan be on a farm say to have be particularly well locate so a to prevent the farmer nearby from trade with the british a practice all too common to those who prefer to sell they produce for british gold rather than the virtually worthless continental currency in he dealing with offender however morgan be typically firm but just for example he capture some person from york county who with team be take to philadelphia the furniture of a man who have just be release from prison through the effort of he wife and who apparently be helpless to prevent the theft of he household goods morgan take charge of the furniture and restore it to it thankful owner but he let the culprit who have steal it go free morgan complain to washington about the man detail to he for scout duty most of they he say be useless they straggle at such a rate he tell the commander-in-chief that if the enemy be enterprising they might get two from we when we would take one of they which make i wish general howe would go on lest any incident happen to we if the hardship of the winter at valley forge be try for healthy man they be of course much more so for those not in good health daniel morgan s rheumatic condition worsen with the increase of the cold and damp weather he have brave the element and the enemy but the strain aid by the winter be catch up with he at last also he be now forty-three year old the mild activity of he command during the sojourn of the troop at valley forge could be handle by a subordinate he feel so like henry knox equally loyal to washington who go to boston at this time morgan receive permission to visit he home in virginia for several week in he absence the rifle regiment be under the command of major thoma posey another able virginian but morgan do not leave before he have write a letter to a william pickman in salem massachusetts apparently an acquaintance praise washington and say that the slander propagate about he be oppose by the general current of the people to exalt general gate at the expense of general washington be injurious to the latter if there be a disinterested patriot in america t- be general washington and he bravery none can question it be doubtful if morgan be able to take home much money to he wife and child for he pay a show by the war department abstract of early 1778 be $ 75 a month a a colonel and that apt to be delay he be show a warm welcome regardless and spend the time in winchester recuperate from he ailment enjoy he family and arrange he private affair which be of course run down he neighbor celebrate he return even if it be only temporary and morgan be especially gratify by the quaint expression of an elderly friend isaac lane who tell he a man that have so often leave all that be dear to he a thou hast to serve thou country must create a sympathetic feel in every patriotic heart there must have be special feeling of joy and patriotism in the heart of daniel morgan too when the news be receive on april 30th of the recognition by france of the independence of the unite state he fellow virginian george washington have state i believe no event be ever receive with more heartfelt joy the dreary camp at valley forge be turn into an arena of rejoice even the dignified washington indulge in a game of wicket with some child he soldier on the whole do not celebrate so mildly on may 6th morgan who have return receive from washington order to send out patrol under vigilant officer to keep near the enemy the reason for this the order say be that the enemy may think to take advantage of the celebration of this day the troop must have more than the common quantity of liquor and perhaps there will be some little drunkenness among they apparently no serious disorder result from the celebration and within a few day morgan join the force of lafayette who now have command of some 2000 man at barren hill not far above philadelphia on the schuylkill the frenchman have be order to approach the enemy s line harass they and get intelligence of they movement interestingly enough the order transmit to morgan through alexander hamilton also inform he that a party of indian will join the party to be send from you command at whitemarsh and act with they these be oneida indian washington evidently be anxious for morgan to be cautious a well a aggressive for on may 17th 18th and 20th he admonish the leader of the riflemen-rangers to be on the alert obviously the commander-in-chief have confidence that morgan would furnish he good intelligence too for on the 23rd of may he tell morgan that the british be prepare to move perhaps in the night and ask morgan to have two of he good horse ready to dispatch to general smallwood with the intelligence obtain meantime however this same general smallwood seem to be serve chivalry a well a the american army colonel benjamin ford write to morgan from wilmington that he understand a mrs sanderson from maryland have obtain permission from smallwood to visit philadelphia and would return on may 26th escort by several officer from maryland belong to the new levy in the british service ford urge morgan to capture these man who he think might be disguise a quaker or peasant morgan take the suggest step but when mrs sanderson appear there be nobody with she but she husband whom he promptly send to headquarters to be question but morgan evidently report matter of intelligence much more important to he command general a letter of a few day late from washington s aide to morgan state he excellency be highly please with you conduct upon this occasion
