george kennan s account of relation between russia and the west from the fall of tsarism to the end of world war 2 be the fine piece of diplomatic history that have appear in many year it combine quality that be seldom find in one work scrupulous scholarship a fund of personal experience a sense of drama and characterization and a broad grasp of the era s great historical issue in short the book base largely on lecture deliver at harvard university be both reliable and readable the author possess an uncommonly fine english style and he be deal with subject of vast importance that be highly topical for we time if mr kennan be sometimes a little somber in he appraisal if he analysis of how western diplomacy meet the challenge of an era of great war and social revolution be often critical and pessimistic well the record itself be not too encourage mr kennan take careful account of every mitigate circumstance in recall the historical atmosphere in which mistake decision be take but he reject perhaps a little too sweepingly the theory that disloyal and pro-communist influence may have contribute to the policy of appease stalin which persist until after the end of the war and reach it high point at the yalta conference in february 1945 after all alger hiss subsequently convict of perjury in deny that he give secret state department document to soviet agent be at yalta and harry dexter white implicate in fbi report in communist association be one of the architect of the morgenthau plan which have it ever be put into full operation would have simply hand germany to stalin one item in this unhappy scheme be to have germany police exclusively by it continental neighbor among whom only the soviet union possess real military strength it be quite probable however that stupidity inexperience and childish adherence to slogan like unconditional surrender have more to do with the unsatisfactory settlement at the end of the war than treason or sympathy with communism mr kennan sum up he judgment of what go wrong this way dash hope you see first of all and in a sense a the source of all other ill the unshakeable american commitment to the principle of unconditional surrender the tendency to view any war in which we might be involve not a a mean of achieve limit objective in the way of change in a give status quo but a a struggle to the death between total virtue and total evil with the result that the war have absolutely to be fight to the complete destruction of the enemy s power no matter what disadvantage or complication this might involve for the more distant future recognize that there could have be no effective negotiate peace with hitler he point out the shock failure to give support to the anti-nazi underground which very nearly eliminate hitler in 1944 a veteran diplomat with an extraordinary knowledge of russian language history and literature kennan recall how at the time of hitler s attack on the soviet union in 1941 he pen a private note to a state department official express the hope that never would we associate ourselves with russian purpose in the area of eastern europe beyond she own boundary the hope be vain with justify bitterness the author speak of what seem to i to have be an inexcusable body of ignorance about the nature of the russian communist movement about the history of it diplomacy about what have happen in the purge and about what have be go on in poland and the baltic state he also speak of franklin d roosevelt s puerile assumption that if only he stalin could be expose to the persuasive charm of someone like fdr himself ideological preconception would melt and russia s co-operation with the west could be easily arrange no wonder khrushchev s first message to president kennedy be a wistful desire for the return of the good old day of roosevelt this fascinate story begin with a sketch rich in personal detail of the glance mutual impact of world war 1 and the two instalment of the russian revolution the first of these involve the replacement of the tsar by a liberal provisional government in march 1917 the second the seizure of power by the bolshevik who late call themselves communist in november of the same year a kennan show the judgment of the ally government about what be happen in russia be warp by the obsession of defeat germany they be blind to the evidence that nothing could keep the russian people fight they attribute everything that go wrong in russia to german influence and intrigue this more than any other factor lead to the fiasco of ally intervention a the author very justly say have a world war not be in progress there would never under any conceivable stretch of the imagination have be an ally intervention in north russia the scope and significance of this intervention have be grossly exaggerate by communist propaganda here kennan operate with precise fact and figure perform an excellent job of debunk plebian dictator of many passage in the book that exemplify the author s vivid style the characterization of the two plebeian dictator whose crime make those of crown autocrat pale by comparison may be select on stalin this be a man of incredible criminality of a criminality effectively without limit a man apparently foreign to the very experience of love without mercy or pity a man in whose entourage none be ever safe a man whose hand be set against all that could not be useful to he at the moment a man who be most dangerous of all to those who be he close collaborator in crime and here be kennan s image of hitler stalin s temporary collaborator in the subjugation and oppression of weak people and he late enemy behind that charlie chaplin moustache and that truant lock of hair that always cover he forehead behind the tirade and the sulky silence the passionate oration and the occasional dull evasive stare behind the prejudice the cynicism the total amorality of behavior behind even the tendency to great strategic mistake there lie a statesman of no mean quality shrewd calculate in many way realistic endow like stalin with considerable power of dissimulation capable of play he card very close to he chest when he so desire yet bold and resolute in he decision and possess one gift stalin do not possess the ability to rouse man to fever pitch of personal devotion and enthusiasm by the power of the speak word two criticism of this generally admirable and fascinate book involve the treatment of wartime diplomacy which be jagged at the edge there be no mention of the potsdam conference or the morgenthau plan and in a conclude chapter about america s stance in the contemporary world one sense certain misplacements of emphasis and a failure to come to grip with the baffle riddle of we time how to deal with a wily and aggressive enemy without appeasement and without war but one should not ask for everything mr kennan who have recently abandon authorship for a new round of diplomacy a the recently appoint american ambassador to yugoslavia be not the only man who find it easy to portray the past than to prescribe for the future the story of a quarter of a century of soviet-western relation be vitally important and it be tell with the fire of a first-rate historical narrator the ireland we usually hear about in the theater be a place of bitter political or domestic unrest lighten occasionally with flash of native wit and charm in donnybrook there be quite a different eire a rural land where sing dance fist-fighting and romance be the thing there be plenty of violence to be sure but it be a nice violence and no one get kill by and large robert mcenroe s adaptation of maurice walsh s film the quiet man provide the entertainment it set out to and we have a lively musical show if not a superlative one this be the tale of one john enright an american who have accidentally kill a man in the prize ring and be now try to forget about it in a quiet place where he may become a quiet man but innesfree where ellen roe danaher and she bully brother will live be no place for a man who will not use he fist so enright s court of the mettlesome ellen be impede considerably thereby provide the tale which be tell you may be sure he marry she in the end and have a fine old knockdown fight with the brother and that there be plenty of minor scrap along the way to ensure that you understand what the word donnybrook mean then there be a matchmaker one mikeen flynn a role for which eddie foy be happily select now there be no reason in the world why a matchmaker in ireland should happen also to be a talent soft-shoe dancer and gift improviser of movement of the limb torso and neck except that these talent add immensely to the enjoyment of the play mr foy be a joy have learn he dance by practice it until he be practically perfect he matchmake be naturally incidental and it only serve flynn right when a determine widow take he by the ear and lead he off to matrimony art lund a fine big actor with a great head of blond hair and a good voice impersonate enright although he be not grace with the subtlety of romantic technique that s not what an ex-prize fighter be suppose to have anyway joan fagan a fiery redhead who can impress you that she have a temper whether she really have one or not play ellen and sing the role very well too if the mettle which ellen exhibit have a bit of theatrical dross in it never mind she fit into the general scheme well enough susan johnson a the widow spend the first half of the play run a bar and sing about the unlamented death of she late husband and the second half try to acquire a new one she have a good firm delivery of song and add to the solid virtue of the even then there be a pair of old biddy play by grace carney and sibly bowan who may be right off the shelf of stock irish character but they put such a combination of good will and malevolence into they part that they re quite entertain and in the role of will danaher philip bosco roar and sneer sufficiently to intimidate not only one american but the whole british army if he choose donnybrook be no brigadoon but it do have some very nice romantic background touch and some excellent dance the ballad be sweet and sad and the music generally competent it sometimes threaten to linger in the memory after the final curtain and some of it such a the catchy sez i do a toast to the bride sing by clarence nordstrom play a character call old man toomey be quite simple direct and touch the man of innesfree be get up authentically in cloth cap and sweater and they dance and sing be fine so be that of the limber company of lass who whirl and glide and quickstep under jack cole s expert choreographic direction the male dancer sometimes wear kilt and they performance in they be spirit and stimulate rouben ter-arutunian in he stage setting often use the scrim curtain behind which mr cole have place couple or group who sing and set the mood for the scene which be to follow there be no reason why most theatergoers should not have a pretty good time at donnybrook unless they be permanently in the mood of enright when he sing about how easily he could hate the lovable irish we can all breathe more easily this morning more easily and joyously too because joshua logan have turn the stage show fanny into a delightful and heart-warming film the task of take the raw material of marcel pagnol s original trio of french film about people of the waterfront in marseilles and put they again on the screen after they passage through the broadway musical idiom be a delicate and perilous one indeed more than the fan of pagnol s old film and of they heroic star the great raimu be look askance at the project the fan of the musical be too but now the task be complete and the uncertainty resolve with the open of the english-dialogue picture at the music hall yesterday whether fan of the pagnol film
