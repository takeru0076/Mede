when the brown & sharpe manufacture company reach it 125th year a a go industrial concern during 1958 it become an almost unique institution in the mechanical world with it history stand astride all but the very beginning of the industrial revolution brown & sharpe have become over the year a singular monument to the mechanical foresight of it founder joseph r brown and a world-renowned synonym for precision and progress in metalworking technology joseph r brown grow up in the bustle and enterprise of new england between 1810 and 1830 he be early expose to the mechanical world and in he youth often help he father david brown master clock and watchmaker a he ply he trade at the age of 17 he become an apprentice machinist at the shop of walcott & harris in valley fall rhode island and follow two or three other job in quick succession after graduation he go into business for himself in 1831 make lathe and small tool this enterprise lead to a father-and-son combination begin in 1833 under the name d brown & son a business which eventually grow into the modern corporation we now call brown & sharpe the year of joseph s partnership with he father be number in 1838 a devastate fire gut they small shop and soon thereafter david brown move west to illinois settle on a land grant in he decline year joseph brown continue in business by himself quickly rebuild the establishment which have be lose in the fire and begin those first step which be to establish he a a pioneer in raise the standard of accuracy of machine shop practice throughout the world much of he genius of course spring from he familiarity with clock movement during these early year the repair of watch and clock and the build of special clock for church steeple form an important part of the young man s occupation he become particularly interest in graduate and precision measurement during the 1840 s and he think along these line develop considerably during this period but he business also grow and we be tell that mr brown find it increasingly difficult to devote a much time to he creative think a he inclination lead he to desire it must have be with some pleasure and relief that on september 12 1848 joseph brown make the momentous entry in he job book in he characteristically cryptic style lucian sharpe come to work for i this day a an apprentice the young apprentice apparently do well by mr brown for in the third year of he apprenticeship lucian be offer a full partnership in the firm the company become jr brown & sharpe and enter into a new and important period of it development mr sharpe s arrival in the business do indeed provide what mr brown have most covete time for tinker and the opportunity of carry out in the back room those development in precision graduation which most interest he at that time by 1853 the new partnership announce the precision vernier caliper a the first fruit of they joint effort the basic significance of this invention help they to follow it rapidly in 1855 by the development of a unique precision gear cut and divide engine that development in turn form the foundation of still more significant expansion in late year in gear cut in circular graduate in index drill and in many other field where accuracy be a paramount requirement throughout they career both mr brown and mr sharpe be interest in the problem of set up standard of measurement for the mechanical trade several effort be make in this direction and though not all of they survive to this day the brown & sharpe wire gage system be eventually adopt a the american standard and be still in common use today a one development follow another the company s reputation for precision in the graduate field bring it broad and broad opportunity for expansion in precision manufacture in 1858 the partnership begin manufacture the willcox & gibbs sew machine a the story go mr gibbs who originally come from the back county of the commonwealth of virginia see an illustration in a magazine of the famous howe sew machine curious a to what make it work he build a crude model of it in wood and file a piece of steel until he succeed in make a metal pickup for the thread enable the crude machine to take stitch when he show this model a he solution a to how the howe sew machine operate he be tell he be wrong and discover to he amazement that the howe machine which be unknown to he in detail use two thread while the one that he have perfect use only one thus be invent the single thread sew machine which mr gibbs in partnership with mr willcox decide to bring to brown & sharpe with the proposal that the small company undertake it manufacture the new work be a boon to the partnership not only for it own value but particularly for the stimulation it provide to the imagination of jr brown toward yet far development for production equipment the turret screw machine now know a the brown & sharpe hand screw machine take it ancestry directly from mr brown s effort to introduce equipment to simplify the manufacture of the sew machine mr brown make important addition to the art in screw machine design by drastically improve the mean for revolve the turret by introduce automatic feed device for the stock and reversible tap and die holder in 1861 mr brown s attention be call to yet another basic production problem the manufacture of twist drill at that time during the civil war union musket be be manufacture in providence and the drill to drill they be be hand-filed with rattail file this process neither satisfy the urgent production schedule nor mr brown s imagination of the possibility in the situation the child of this problem be mr brown s famous serial no 1 universal mill machine the archtype from which be descend today s universal knee-type mill machine use throughout the world the original machine bear it famous serial number be still on exhibition at the brown & sharpe precision center in providence during the civil war period mr brown also invent the brown & sharpe form tooth gear cutter a basic invention which ultimately revolutionize the world s gear manufacture industry by change it basic economics up until that time it have be possible to make cutter for make gear tooth but they be good for only one sharpen a soon a the time come for re-sharpening the precise form of the gear tooth be lose and a new cutter have to be make this process make the economical manufacture of gear questionable until some way could be find to permit the repeat re-sharpening of gear tooth cutter without the loss of the precision form mr brown s invention achieve this and a a byproduct form the cornerstone of brown & sharpe s position of leadership in the gear make equipment field which last until the 1920 s when supercede by other method the micrometer caliper a a common workshop tool also owe much to jr brown although mr brown be not himself it inventor it be a french idea it be typical that he intuition first conceive the importance of mass produce this basic tool for general use so it be that when mr brown and mr sharpe first see the french tool on exhibition in paris in 1868 they bring a sample with they to the unite state and start brown & sharpe in yet another field where it retain it leadership to this day the final achievement of mr brown s long and interest mechanical career run a close second in importance to he development of the universal mill machine that achievement be he creation of the universal grind machine which make it appearance in 1876 at the philadelphia centennial exposition this machine like it mill counterpart be the antecedent of a machine-family use to this very day in precision metalworking shop throughout the world along with jr brown s other major development the universal grind machine be profoundly influential in set the course of brown & sharpe for many year to come follow mr brown s death there come forward in the brown & sharpe organization many other man who contribute greatly to the development of the company one such man be samuel darling a head of the firm darling & swartz mr darling begin by challenge brown & sharpe to it keen competition during the 1850 s and early 60 s in 1868 however a truce be call between the company and the partnership of darling brown & sharpe be form between that year and the buy out of mr darling s interest in 1892 a large portion of the company s precision tool business be carry out under the name of darling brown & sharpe and to this day many old precision tool be in use still bear that famous trademark perhaps the outstanding standard bearer of mr brown s tradition for accuracy be mr oscar j beale whose mechanical genius closely paralleled that of mr brown and whose particular forte be the development of the exceedingly accurate measure machinery that enable brown & sharpe to manufacture gage and therefore it product with an accuracy exceed anything then available elsewhere in the world also important on the brown & sharpe scene at the turn of the century be mr richmond viall work superintendent of the company from 1876 to 1910 mr viall possess remarkable talent for the leadership and development of man he be an ardent champion of the brown & sharpe apprentice program and personal counselor to countless able man who first develop they industrial talent with the company in one sense it can be say that one of the most important brown & sharpe product over the year have be the man who begin work with the company and subsequently come to place of industrial eminence throughout the nation and even abroad commence with the death of lucian sharpe in 1899 the name of henry d sharpe be for more than 50 year closely interwoven with the destiny of the company during he presidency the company s physical plant be enormously expand and the length and breadth of the brown & sharpe machine tool line become the great in the world during the early part of this century the brown & sharpe work in providence be unchallenged a the large single manufacture facility devote exclusively to precision machinery and tool manufacture anywhere in the world during these year the company s product line follow the basic tenet lay down by mr brown it expand from hand screw machine to automatic screw machine from simple formed-tooth gear cut machine to gear hobbing machine and a large contract gear manufacture business from rudimentary belt-driven universal mill machine to a broad line of elaborately control knee-type and manufacture type mill machine in the grind machine field expansion go far from universal grinder alone and take in cylindrical grinder surface grinder and a wide variety of special and semi-special model in 1951 henry d sharpe jr succeed he father and continue the company s development a a major factor in the metal-work equipment business the company be still broaden it line and be now active on four major front the machine tool division be currently produce brown & sharpe single spindle automatic screw machine grind machine of many type and knee and bed-type mill machine recently add be the brown & sharpe turret drill machine which introduce the company to an entirely new field of tool development in the industrial product division the company manufacture and market a wide line of precision gaging and inspection equipment machinist tool include micrometer vernier caliper and accessory in the cut tool division the principal product include a wide variety of high speed steel mill cutter end mill and saw
