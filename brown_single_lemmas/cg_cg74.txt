let we see just how typical krim be he be new york-born and jewish he spend one year at the university of north carolina because thoma wolfe go there he return to new york to work for the new yorker to edit a western pulp to duck the war in the owi to write publicity for paramount picture and commentary for a newsreel then he begin he career a critic for various magazine now he have abandon all that to be a writer i do not want to quibble about typicality in a certain sense one manner of experience will be typical of any give group while another will not but i ve get news for krim he s not typical he s pretty special he may typify a certain kind of postwar new york experience but he experience be certainly not typical of he generation s in any case who ever think that new york be typical of anything man of krim s age aspiration and level of sophistication be typically involve in politics before the war they do not duck the war but they fight in it however reluctantly they sweat out some kind of formal education they read widely and eclectically they do not fall into pseudo-glamorous job on pseudo-glamorous magazine but they do whatever nasty thing they could get in order to eat they find out who they be and what they could do then within the limit of they talent they do it they do not worry about experience because experience thrust itself upon they and they travel out of new york only a native new yorker could believe that new york be now or ever be a literary center it be a publish and public relation center but these very fact prevent it from be a literary center because writer dislike provincialism and untruth krim s typicality consist only in he new yorker s view that new york be the world he display what outlanders call the new york mind a state that the subject be necessarily unable to perceive in himself the new york mind be two part abstraction and one part misinformation about the rest of the country and in fact the world in he fulminate against the literary world krim be really struggle with the new yorker in himself but it s a lose battle closely relate to he illusion about he typicality be krim s complicate feel about he jewishness he write most of i friend and i be jewish we be also literary the combination of the jewish intellectual tradition and the sensibility need to be a writer create in i circle the most potent and incredible intellectual-literary ambition i have ever see or could ever have imagine within themselves just a people i friend be often torture and unappeasably bitter about be the offspring of this unhappily unique-ingrown-screwedup breed they read and think give an extension to they normal blush about appear jewish in subway bus racetrack movie house any of the public place that use to make the jew of i generation self-conscious heavy thinker walk across seventh avenue without they glass on will to dare the truck a long a they do nt look like the ikey-kikey caricature of the yiddish intellectual at other point in he narrative krim associate jewishness with unappeasable literary ambition with abstraction with he personal turn aside from the good the true and the beautiful of fiction in the manner of jame t farrell to the international the false and the inflate krim say in short that he be a suffer jew the only possible answer to that be i be a suffer franco-irishman we all love to suffer but some of we love to suffer more than other have krim go far from new york than chapel hill he might have discover that large number of american jew do not find he new york version of the jew lot remotely recognizable more important be the simple human point that all man suffer and that it be a kind of anthropological-religious pride on the part of the jew to believe that he suffer be more poignant than i or anyone else s this be not to deny the existence of pogrom and ghetto but only to assert that these horror have have an effect on the nerve of people who do not experience they that among the various side effect be the local hysteria of jewish writer and intellectual who cry out from confusion which they call oppression and pain in they stupidity and arrogance they believe they be call upon to remind the gentile continually of pogrom and ghetto some of we have imagination and sensibility too finally there be the undeniable fact that some of the fine american fiction be be write by jew but it be not jewish fiction saul bellow and bernard malamud through intellectual toughness perception through experience in fact have obviously liberate themselves from any sentimental krim self-indulgence they might have be tempt to krim s main attack be upon the aesthetic and the publish apparatus of american literary culture in we day krim be able to get an advance for a novel and time and opportunity to write at yaddo but it be no good i have natural sock he say a a storyteller and be precociously good at description dialogue and most of the other staple of the fiction-writer s trade but i be bug by a mammoth complex of thought and feeling that prevent i from do more than just diddle the surface of sustain fiction-writing and again how can you write when you have nt yet read bartleby the scrivener krim come to believe that the novel a a form have outlive it vital mean he articulate jewish friend convince he that education read read be a must he move in a highly intellectual group in greenwich village in the late forties become internationalize overnight then follow a period in which he write review for the new york time book review the commonweal commentary have a small piece in partisan review and move on to hudson the village voice and exodus the work for commonweal be more satisfy than work for commentary because of the staff s tiptoe fear of make a booboo commentary be a mere suburb of partisan review the arch-enemy both magazine be rigid with reactionary what-will-t s eliot-or-martin buber-think fear partisan have fail krim say for be snob-clannish overcerebral europeanish aristocratically alienate from the we it be the creation of a monstrous historical period wherein it think it have to synthesize literature and politics and avant-garde art of every kind with it writer crazily try to outdo each other in spenglerian inclusiveness kenyon sewanee and hudson operate in an anglo-protestant new critical chill they example cause krim and he friend to put on englishy air affect all sort of impressive scholarship and social-register unnaturalness in order to slip through they narrow transom and get into they page qui sexcuse saccuse a the french jewish intellectual use to say through all this rave krim be perform a traditional and by now boring rite the attack on intelligence upon the largely successful attempt of the magazine he castigate to liberate american write from local color and other variety of romantic corn god know that partisan and the rest often be and remain guilty of intellectual flatulence sociological jargon germano-slavic approximation to english third-rate but modish fiction and outrage to common sense have often disfigure partisan and in lesser degree the other magazine on the list what krim ignore in he contempt for history and for accuracy be that these magazine partisan foremost bring about a genuine revolution in the american mind from the mid-thirties to approximately 1950 the most obvious characteristic of contemporary american write apart from the beat nonsense be it cosmopolitanism the process of cosmopolitanism have begin in earnest about 1912 but the first war and the depression virtually stall that process in it track without the good magazine without they book review they hospitality to european writer without above all they awareness of literary standard we might very well have have a generation of krim s hero wolfes farrells dreisers and i might add sandburgs and frost and macleishes in verse and then where would we be screw stew and tattooe a krim might say after read a book about sailor when partisan and kenyon set up shop mencken be still accept a an arbiter of taste remember hergesheimer george jeans nathan and alexander woollcott be honore in odd quarter and the whole booth tarkington willa catheter sic pearl buck amy lowell william lyon phelps atmosphere lie thick a los angeles smog over the country politics economics sociology the entire area of life that lie between literature and what krim call experience urgently need to be dig into the university certainly be not do it nor be the popular magazine of the day this partisan above all do if it have never print a word of literature it contribution to the politico-sociological area would still be historic but it do print good verse and good fiction if the editor sometimes doze and print pretentious new york-mind dross they also print malraux silone chiaromonte gide bellow robert lowell francis fergusson mary mccarthy delmore schwartz mailer elizabeth hardwick eleanor clark and a host of other good writer partisan review and the other literary magazine help to educate in the good sense an entire generation that these magazine also delude the krims of the world be unfortunate but inevitable it be a fact of life that magazine be edit by group they have to be or they would nt be publish at all and it be also a fact of life that there will always be youngish half-educated people around who will be dazzle by the glitter of what look like a literary movement there be no literary movement there be only writer do they work literary movement be the creation of pimp who live off writer when krim say i be a severe a critical-intellectual environment a can be imagine he be off he rocker he indicate that he have none of the discipline that criticism require include education the result be he inevitable bedazzlement through ignorance he be nt be educate in those village bull-sessions a he claim no one be ever educate through bull-sessions in anything other than to quote he again perfume bullshit only a new york hick would expect to find the literary life in greenwich village at any point late than walt whitman s day the highly intellectual mind that krim say he encounter in the village do they work in spite of not because of any village atmosphere but krim s complaint be important because not only in new york but in other city and in university throughout this country young and not so young man at this moment be be bedazzle by half-digested idea those who have quality will outgrow the experience the rest will turn beat or into dentist or into beat dentist for the sad truth be that while one might write well without have read bartleby the scrivener one be more likely to write well if one have read it and much else the most appal aspect of krim s piece be he reflection of the beat aesthetic he mention the beat only once when he refer to they have revive through mere power and abandonment and the unwillingness to commit death in life some idea of a decent equivalent between verbal expression and actual experience but the entire narrative be write in the tiresome vocabulary of that lose and die cause and in the spring syntax that be suppose to supplant we mother tongue krim s aesthetic combine anti-intellectualism conscious and unconscious naivete and a winsome reliance upon the natural and upon experience idea be the thruway to nowhere i touchstone have be strictly literature and humanly enough american literature because that be what i want to write he allude to something call direct write and he find that criticism get in the way of he true real imaginative bounce
