slowly he pull out the hand throttle until the boat be move at little more than a crawl and watch elaine rapidly spin from one station to another tune in the null then draw in a line on the chart we re out just a little too far make a 90 degree straight for shore poet come in raise he eyebrow appreciatively a he see elaine now he ask pretty quick she reply will you drop the anchor poet nod swing below and a moment late emerge from the forward hatch where he pick up the anchor the rock and roll music come from the radio station suddenly fade a the boat coast into the null on the afj reverse elaine say then peer through the loop of the rdf and wave to poet a second late she come behind the wheel and back off the anchor line until it be set in the ocean floor she cut the engine and slowly the cruiser swing around on the end of it line until it bow be point into the wind and the cockpit face toward the shore nick watch she somewhat enviously a she efficiently cut the engine and start the auxiliary motor poet come up from below wear new bathing trunk the price tag hang from the belt and he pull it off a he enter the chartroom and look at it curiously nick wonder if elaine have buy they but he say nothing nobody he suddenly realize be say anything it seem a if they be all under a spell there should be an excite conversation for somewhere directly below they be a treasure lose for more than four hundred year but instead of chatter there be a null like on the radio direction finder once in new york he have go fly with some friend in a small private airplane with a single engine they have all be laugh joke when suddenly the engine have fail no one have scream no one have pray all have fall into a complete silence listen to the wind whistle over the wing the pilot have be good he d land the plane on a small airstrip in connecticut and a soon a the aircraft have coast to a stop everyone have burst into chatter at the same moment there have be tension in the plane during the silent descent a tension similar to the one now but in the plane there be a concrete reason for it now at this moment there should be none unless skin dive be much more dangerous than he have be lead to believe yet tension exist the same taut-nerved relationship a there have be between the passenger on the plane now strain at the three of they here on the boat it hang over they like a cloud it arrival a sudden a a cloud skid over the sun silently elaine pick up she key from the table and go out into the cockpit poet behind she nick trail behind he she throw back a cushion over one of the seat unlock a padlock on the chest beneath it then presently straighten hold a long knife and a wicked look spear gun in she hand poet whistle softly a he look at the gun hydraulic he ask elaine nod they be the good she kick the locker lid shut and replace the cushion they be the most efficient and the deadly poet comment a he buckle on he tank harness why do you need an arsenal nick ask apprehensively stare at the weapon it s quite possible there s more than codfish down there man poet reply with a short nervous laugh a he hold the harness for elaine a moment late move awkwardly because of the swim fin she pick up the gun hand the knife to poet then roll off the transom of the boat back first poet nod to nick and enter the water in a similar fashion another moment and they be out of sight leave behind only a string of bubble a a clue to they whereabouts for a while nick follow the twist course of the bubble wonder which set come from elaine they remain close together they air trail wiggle like serpent travel side by side eventually the bubble become lose in the sparkle of the ocean surface and he roll over on he back clasp he hand behind he head he stare at the blue sky there be nothing quite like be alone on a boat on the ocean alfredo certainly must have enjoy be alone next to the ocean probably the lonely spot be the desert if elaine s uncle have stick to this desire for aloneness he probably would still be alive yet alfredo want money want money to roam through the desert and graham want money probably to roam among the dice table in la vegas it be an odd combination a strange pair to stumble upon the wreck of the trinidad but graham have nt stumble on it two to three week prior to the charter of the virginia graham have be snoop around the san luis rey mission the small helicopter with it two steel skid churn offshore and nick raise up to watch it head south that be a hell of a note he think a couple could nt even find a seclude spot anywhere on a beach to neck nowadays without someone swoop down upon they if the character fly that thing have go over san clemente island yesterday he would have have an eyeful off to the west a beautiful schooner slowly beat it way into the wind head on a tack toward san clemente behind it a cabin cruiser drift crossway in the small ground-swell a lone fisherman in the chair aft the fisherman be right in the middle of the deep nick recall story that the two good fish spot in southern california be over the la jolla deep and the redondo deep two spot where the ocean drop off to fantastic depth almost from the shoreline someday geologist have warn the land on both side of these deep would fall into the ocean and no more la jolla or redondo beach meanwhile fisherman take advantage of they to pull up whopper sometimes the fish explode a they near the surface because of the difference in pressure why he wonder have elaine want he along on this trip he could nt skindive he could nt run a boat except on the open sea he stand up stretch look around for the bubble but could see none stroll down to the galley he light the butane under the coffee pot and when the brew be heat pour himself a cup and go up to the chartroom turn on the hi-fi he go back to the cockpit stretch out on the cushion and listen to the music elaine and poet return together pop up over the transom almost like dolphin break water he sit up and watch a they pull themselves over the stern any luck he ask poet shake he head slide he face mask up on he forehead we re right on the edge of the deep elaine say pull off she face mask she carefully place the spear gun across the stern then lift she wet hair from she back and squeeze out the water which be a break a the area to search be less than a square mile she add a she swing she leg over the transom any news not a thing he toss she a towel then repeat the service for poet cigarette elaine shake she head a she slip out of she harness but poet nod he foot still hang over the stern of the transom but a he reach for the smoke he raise they to swing they in the fin on he foot catch on the mould throw he off balance he forearm smash painfully into the narrow washboard and he grimace a he grab he bruise limb with he other hand and roll into the boat kee-reist the word hiss distinctly from poet s lip a he struggle to he foot nick s body become rigid turn slowly he see poet in a brilliant glare of horror poet he face be still crease in pain a he study the underside of he arm poet a murderer turn quickly toward elaine nick see that she too stand in shock surprise the sudden silence be too silent instinctively aware of the charge atmosphere poet raise he head slowly look first at elaine she have catch the implication of the oath she face be freeze into the mask of a mannequin she body absolutely motionless and then nick know that all of they know elaine himself and poet elaine recover first so quickly that nick think he might have imagine she sudden reaction do you need a bandage she ask steadily poet rub he arm it s like bang a shin he say he eye linger on nick s face then move back to elaine hurt like hell for a second then it disappear i ll get some ointment elaine turn and start toward the companionway but she walk be too steady too slow telegraph she fear nick sense it so do poet spring like a cat he leap back swoop up the spring gun and whirl point it toward the cabin at the same instant nick hit the barrel and throw himself upon the small man the gun fire next to he ear with a vicious whoosh like the first stroke of an old steam engine at the same instant elaine scream wildly the sound end abruptly a nick go off the boat and into the water on top of the frantic struggle poet the moment the sea close over nick some atavistic sense warn he that he would survive in this alien element only if he do not panic but the murderer to whom he cling have a tremendous advantage the wide flipper on poet s foot give he leg incredible power drive the two of they down into the water a they roll over and over poet be the capture arm pinion to he side and he twist convulsively try to escape poet would escape nick think grimly because he wear the apparatus which would keep he alive under water but nick would not let go the rubber and glass face mask slip from poet s forehead bounce painlessly off nick s chin then disappear poet twist again and nick s knuckle scrape on the air tank rip off the skin for a split second nick relax he grip and poet s slippery body spin completely around before nick could stop he hold he now from the rear something flail at the side of nick s head a they roll around and around suddenly poet stop struggle and the two of they hang suspend in the water not rise not sink a sharp pain lance across nick s chest and a bubble of air escape from he torture lung join dozens of other that sail lazily toward the surface like helium balloon rise into the sky a black snake-like object sway eerily in front of he spew bubble from it flat cobra head the air hose be free the discovery strike nick like a blow desperately nick flash one hand up catch poet s neck in the bend of he elbow at the same instant he grab the loose writhing hose with he other hand and bit down on the hard rubber mouthpiece instinctively he exhale through he nose then suck in the air from the hose at once the excruciating pain in he chest stop and he be seize with a sudden wild exultation a if this be a signal poet abruptly begin to thrash the water and the quick movement slowly make they sink through the water relentlessly nick hold on suck on the hose inhale the air that belong to poet poet be not fight nick now
