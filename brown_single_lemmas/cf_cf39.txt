this conclusion be dependent on the assumption that traditional sex more will continue to sanction both premarital chastity a the ideal and the double standard hold female primarily responsible for preserve the ideal we discussion of this involve use erik erikson s schema of identity vs identity diffusion a a conceptual tool in superimpose a few common denominator onto the diverse personality and family configuration of the unwed mother from whose case history we quote early we discussion do not utilize all the identity crisis postulate by erikson but be intend to demonstrate the utility of he theoretical schema for study unwed mother we hope thereby to emphasize that from a psychological standpoint the effectual prevention of illegitimacy be a continuous long-term process involve the socialization of the female from infancy through adolescence hypothesize a series of developmental stage that begin in the individual s infancy and end in he old age erikson have indicate that the adolescent be face with a series of identity crisis the successful and positive resolution of these crisis during adolescence involve an epigenetic principle during adolescence the individual s positive resolution in each area of identity crisis depend to a considerable degree on he already have resolve preliminary and preparatory identity crisis during he infancy childhood and early adolescence within erikson s schema the adolescent s delinquent behavior in this case she unwed motherhood reflect she identity diffusion or she inability to resolve these various identity crisis positively the adolescent experience identity crisis in term of time perspective vs time diffusion time perspective the ability to plan for the future and to postpone gratify immediate want in order to achieve long-range objective be more easily develop if from infancy on the individual have be able to rely on and trust people and the world in which she life erikson have note that unless this trust develop early the time ambivalence experience in vary degree and temporarily by all adolescent a a result of they remember the more immediate gratification of want during childhood while not yet have fully accept the long-range plan require by adulthood may develop into a more permanent sense of time diffusion experience of this time diffusion range from a sense of utter apathy to a feel of desperate urgency to act immediately these polar extreme in time diffusion be indicate in some of the comment by unwed mother report in early chapter some of these mother apparently feel a desperate urgency make on the spur of the moment commitment in love and sex that would have life-long consequence other display utter apathy and indifference to any decision about the past or the future for many of these unwed mother the data on they family life and early childhood experience reveal several indication and source of they basic mistrust of they parent in particular and of the world in general however a erickson have note the individual s failure to develop preliminary identity during infancy and childhood need not be irreversibly deterministic with respect to a give area of identity diffusion in he or she adolescence and a show in chapter 6 some snp female originally develop such trust only during they adolescence through the aid of and they identification with alter-parents in the specific case of time diffusion we must emphasize the significance of the early development of mistrust when it be combine with the inevitable time crisis experience by most if not all adolescent in we society and with the failure of the adolescent period to provide opportunity for develop trust the adolescent experience two closely relate crisis self-certainty vs an identity consciousness and role-experimentation vs negative identity a sense of self-certainty and the freedom to experiment with different role or confidence in one s own unique behavior a an alternative to peer-group conformity be more easily develop during adolescence if during early childhood the individual be permit to exercise initiative and encourage to develop some autonomy however if the child have be constantly surround during nursery and early school age by peer group inculcate with the primacy of group acceptance and group standard and allow little initiative in early play and work pattern then in adolescence she normal degree of vanity sensitivity and preoccupation with whether other find she appearance and behavior acceptable will be compound she ostensible indifference to and rebellion against suggestion and criticism by anyone except peer friend during adolescence be the manifestation in she adolescence of she have be indoctrinate in childhood to feel shame if not guilt for fail to behave in a manner acceptable to and judge by the performance of she nursery - and elementary-school peer friend to be different be to invite shame and doubt and it be good to be shame and criticize by one s parent who already consider one different and difficult to understand than by one s peer who be also experience a similar grope for and denial of adult status the attitude of some unwed mother quote in chapter 2 reveal both considerable preoccupation with be accept by other and a mark absence of self-certainty many appear to regard they sexual behavior a a justifiable mean of gain acceptance from and identification with other but very few seem aware that such acceptance and identification need to be supplement with more endure and stable identification of and with one s self another identity crisis confront the adolescent involve anticipation of achievement vs work-paralysis the adolescent s capacity to anticipate achievement and to exercise the self-discipline necessary to complete task successfully depend on the degree to which he or she develop autonomy initiative and self-discipline during childhood the developmental process involve the individual s progressively experience a sense of dignity and achievement result from have complete task have keep commitment and have create something however small or simple even a doll dress of one s own design rather than in the design it ought to be these childhood experience be source of the self-certainty that the adolescent need for experiment with many role and for the freedom to fail sometimes in the process of explore and discover she skill and ability if she have not have such experience the female s normal adolescent degree of indecision will be compound she may well be incapacitate by it when she be confront with present and future alternative eg whether to prepare primarily for a career or for the role of a homemaker whether to stay financially dependent on she parent or help support herself while attend school whether to pursue a college education or a job after high school and whether to attend this or that college and to follow this or that course of study erikson have note that a this indecision mount it may result in a paralysis of workmanship this paralysis may be express in the female s start and never complete many job task and course of study and in the fact that she base she decision about work college carreer and study on what other be do rather than on she own sense of identity with give skill ability like and dislike the absence during she childhood and early adolescence of experience in develop the self-discipline to complete task within she ability experience that would have be subsequent source of anticipation of achievement and she lack of childhood opportunity to practice autonomy and initiative in play and expression both tend in she adolescence to deprive she of the freedom to role-experiment and to fail occasionally in experiment the comment make by some unwed mother quote in chapter 2 reflect this paralysis of workmanship they attend school and select course primarily on the basis of decision other make they accept a job primarily because it be available convenient and pay reasonably these thing both express and at the same time continue contribute to they identity diffusion in an area that could have become a source of develop dignity and self-certainty a they identity diffusion increase they become more susceptible to sporadic diversion in love and sexual affair these affair temporarily relieve the monotony of school or work activity contain no anticipation of achievement and joy of craftsmanship no sense of dignity derive from a job well do childhood experience in learn work and self-discipline habit within a context of develop autonomy and initiative have considerable significance for the prevention of illegitimacy the excerpt from case history present above confirm this significance though through different facet of experience for example some unwed mother have have no work experience household chore and responsibility during childhood and early adolescence they subsequently occupy they leisure hour in search for something exciting and divert sex be both on the other hand some unwed mother have have so much work and responsibility impose on they at an early age and have thus have so little freedom or opportunity to develop autonomy and initiative that they work and responsibility become dull and unrewarding burden to be escape and rebel against through fun and experimentation with forbid sexual behavior the adolescent also face the identity crisis that erikson have term ideological polarization vs diffusion of ideal in discuss the way this crisis be germane to consderations for the prevention of illegitimacy we shall again superimpose erikson s concept on we data adolescent have a much-discussed tendency to polarize idea and value to perceive thing a either-or black or white nuance of mean be relatively unimportant this tendency be perhaps most clearly reveal in the literature on religious conversion and experience of adolescent erikson have postulate that such ideological polarization temporarily resolve they search for something stable and definite in the rapidly change and fluctuate no-mans-land between childhood and adulthood it provide identification with an idea a value a cause that cut through or even transcend the multiple and ambivalent identity of they passage from child to adult and permit they forceful and overt expression of emotion the positive development during adolescence of this capacity to think and to feel strongly and with increase independence and to identify overtly either with or against give idea value and practice depend to a considerable degree on both previous and present opportunity for develop autonomy initiative and self-certainty most adolescent have some ideological diffusion at various developmental stage a they experience a proliferation of idea and value the diffusion be most pronounce and most likely to become fix however in those who have have no or very minimal opportunity to develop the autonomy and initiative that could have be direct into constructive expression and so serve a source of develop self-certainty a pronounce ideological diffusion ie inability to identify independently with give idea and value system be reflect in many way for example it be evince by the adolescent or adult whose belief and action represent primarily he rebellion and reaction against the idea and behavior pattern of other rather than he inner conviction and choice it be mirror by the individual willie lohmans whose idea and behavior pattern be so dependent and relativistic that they always coincide with those of the individual or group present and most important at the moment in another sense it be represent in the argument of the true believer who seek to disprove the validity of all other belief and idea in order to retain confidence in theirs the case history provide some interest illustration of ideological diffusion embody in the unwed mother s inability to identify independently a give value system or behavior pattern and she subsequent disinclination to assume any individual responsibility for she sexual behavior for example the unwed mother express they frustration with male who do not indicate more explicitly what it be they really want from a girl so one can act accordingly they be disappoint by the physical and emotional hurt of premarital sexual intercourse they condemn the movie script writer for imply that sex be enjoyable and exhilarating they criticize parent for never have emphasize traditional concept of right and wrong and they censure parent who never discipline and be too permissive or who never explain how easy it be to get pregnant in the adult world there be a number of rather general and diffuse source of ideological diffusion that far compound the adolescent s search for mean during this particular identity crisis for example some contemporary write tend to fuse the good guy and the bad guy to portray the weak people a hero and weakness a a virtue and to explain or even justify asocial behavior by attribute it to deterministic psychological familial and social experience
