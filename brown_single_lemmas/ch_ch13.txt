mr dooley mr speaker for several year now the commuter railroad serve we large metropolitan area have find it increasingly difficult to render the kind of service we expand population want and be entitle to have the cause of the decline of the commuter railroad be many and complex high tax loss of revenue to government subsidize highway and air carrier to name but two and the solution to the problem of the commuter line have be equally vary range all the way from government ownership to complete discontinuance of this important service there have be a number of sound plan propose but none of these have be implement instead we have stand idly by watch we commuter railroad service decline and have fail to offer a help hand though the number of people flow in and out of we metropolitan area each day have increase tremendously since world war 2 total annual rail commutation drop 124 million for 1947 to 1957 nowhere have this decline be more painfully evident than in the new york city area here the new york central railroad one of the nation s most important carrier have alone lose 476 percent of it passenger since 1949 at this time of crisis in we nation s commuter railroad a new threat to the continue operation of the new york central have appear in the form of the chesapeake & ohio railroad s proposal for control of the baltimore & ohio railroad the new york central have point out that this control if approve by the interstate commerce commission would give the combine c & o - b & o railroad a total of 185 point serve in common with the new york central not only be this kind of duplication wasteful but it give the combine system the ability to take freight traffic away from the new york central and other railroad serve the area the new york central note the freight traffic most susceptible to raid by the c & o - b & o provide the backbone of central s revenue these revenue make it possible to provide essential freight and passenger service over the entire new york central system a well a the new york area commuter and terminal freight service if these service be to be maintain the new york central must have the revenue to make they possible the new york central today handle 60 percent of all southbound commuter traffic come into new york city this be a $ 14 million operation involve 3500 employee who work on commuter traffic exclusively a blow to this phase of the central s operation would have serious economic consequence not only to the railroad itself but to the 40000 people per day who be provide with efficient reasonably price transportation in and out of the city there be a workable alternative to this potentially dangerous and harmful c & o - b & o merger scheme the central have point out the logic of create a strong balance competitive two-system railroad service in the east be so obvious that b & o be publicly commit to the approach outline here detail study of the plan be well underway though far from completion these study indicate beyond a doubt that saving would result which would be of unprecedented benefit to the railroad concern they investor they customer they user and to the public at large then abandon the study in the face of they promise outlook for all concern b & o enter on-again-off-again negotiation with c & o which result in the present situation in the light of the fact at hand however new york central intend to pursue the objective of help to create a healthy two-system eastern railroad structure in the public interest the interstate commerce commission will commence it deliberation on the propose c & o - b & o merger on june 18 obviously the interstate commerce commission will not force the new york central to far curtail it commuter operation by give undue competitive advantage to the line that wish to merge however there be a more profound consideration to this propose merger than profit and loss that be will it serve the long-range public interest for the past 40 year congress have advocate a carefully plan balance and competitive railway system we must ask ourselves which of the two alternative will help the commuter the two-way b & o - c & o merger or the three-way new york central - b & o - c & o merger which will serve not only the good interest of the stockholder but the interest of all the travel public mr lindsay mr speaker i rise

new york time a one of the great and authoritative newspaper of the world mr stratton mr speaker in i late newsletter to i constituent i urge the imposition of a naval blockade of cuba a the only effective method of prevent continue soviet armament from come into the western hemisphere in violation of the monroe doctrine yesterday i have the privilege of read a thoughtful article in the we news & world report of may 8 which discuss this type of action in more detail include both it advantage and it disadvantage under leave to extend i remark i include the relevant portion of i newsletter together with the text of the article from the we news & world report you congressman samuel s stratton report from washington may 1 1961 cuban ssr whatever may have be the setback result from the unsuccessful attempt of the cuban rebel to establish a beachhead on the castro-held mainland last week there be at least one positive benefit and that be the clear-cut revelation to the whole world of the complete conversion of cuba into a russian-dominated military base in fact one of the major reason for the failure of the ill-starred expedition appear to have be a lack of full information on the extent to which cuba have be get this russian military equipment somehow the picture and story of soviet t-34 tank on cuban beach and russian mig jet fighter strafe rebel troop have bring home to all of we the stark blunt truth of what it mean to have a russian military base 90 mile away from home russian tank and plane in cuba jeopardize the security of the unite state violate the monroe doctrine and threaten the security of every other latin american republic once the full extent of this russian military penetration of cuba be clear president kennedy announce we would take whatever action be appropriate to prevent this even if we have to go it alone but the latin american republic who have be rather incline to drag they foot on take action against castro also react swiftly last week by finally throw cuba off the inter-american defense board for year the unite state have be try to get these country to exclude castro s representative from secret military talk but it take the picture of the mig and the t-34 tank to do the job there be a new atmosphere of urgency in washington this week you can see it for example in the extensive effort president kennedy have make to enlist solid bipartisan support for he action toward both cuba and laos effort a i see it which be be direct by the way toward support for future action not for those already past what the next move will be only time of course will tell personally i think we ought to set up an immediate naval blockade of cuba we simply can nt tolerate far russian weapon include the possibility of long-range nuclear missile be locate in cuba obviously we can nt stop they from come in however just by talk a naval blockade would be thoroughly in line with the monroe doctrine would be a relatively simple operation to carry out and would bring an abrupt end to soviet penetration of we hemisphere from we news & world report may 8 1961 next for cuba an arm blockade look at castro now cocky than ever with arm and agent to threaten the america how can the unite state act blockade be one answer offer by expert in it they see a way to isolate cuba stop infiltration maybe finish castro too this be the question now face president kennedy how to put a stop to the soviet buildup in cuba and to communist infiltration of this hemisphere on april 25 the white house report that a total embargo of remain we trade with cuba be be consider it aim to undermine far cuba s economy weaken castro another strategy bold and tough be also attract notice in washington a naval and air blockade to cut cuba off from the world destroy castro blockade in the view of military and civilian expert could restore tooth to the monroe doctrine it could halt a flood of communist arm and strategic supply now reach castro it could stop cuban re-export of gun and propaganda material to south america it would be the most severe reprisal short of declare war that the unite state could invoke against castro it be the strategy of blockade therefore that be suddenly at the center of attention of administration official member of congress officer in the pentagon a a possible course of action it also be the center of debate and be raise many question among these question what would a cuba blockade take military expert say a tight naval blockade off cuban port and at the approach to cuban water would require two naval task force each build around an aircraft carrier with a complement of about 100 plane and several destroyer the navy on april 25 announce it be bring back the carrier shangri-la from the mediterranean increase to four the number of attack carrier in the vicinity of cuba more than 36 other big navy ship be no less than a day s sail time away to round out the blockade force submarine would be need to locate identify and track approach vessel land-based radar would help with this task so would radar picket ship a squadron of navy jet and another of long-range patrol plane would add support to the carrier task force three requirement go with a blockade it must be proclaim the blockade force must be powerful enough to enforce it and it must be enforce without discrimination once these condition of international law be meet country that try to run the blockade do so at they own risk blockade runner can be stop by gunfire if necessary search and hold at least temporarily they could be send to we port for ruling whether cargo should be confiscate what could a blockade accomplish plenty say the expert in a broad sense it would reaffirm the monroe doctrine by oppose communist interference in the western hemisphere it could by avoid direct intervention provide a short-of-war strategy to meet short-of-war infiltration primary target would be shipment of tank gun aviation gasoline and ammunition come from russia and czechoslovakia shipment of arm from western country could similarly be seize a contraband in a total blockade action could also be take against ship bring in chemical oil textile and even foodstuff at time three ship a day from the soviet bloc be unload in cuban port
