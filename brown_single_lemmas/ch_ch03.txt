all the occasion of i first meet with the honorable speaker of the house at that time he afford i the courtesy of he busy workday for such length a i may need to speak about i background i hope i view on various national and local topic and any problem that i may have be vex with at the time he be fatherly in he handle of all subject with i and tremendously wise in he counsel in conclusion he wish

height of unpleasantness and exciting legislative struggle and a the nation witness these contest he rise even a admit by those who differ with he to the proportion of a hero and a noble partisan i be highly privilege today to commemorate the brilliant career of this parliamentary giant he will ever be i example a a true statesman one who be thoroughly human who affect no dignity and who be endow with real ability genuine worth and sterling honesty all dedicate to secure the good interest of the country he have love and serve so long may the divine speaker in heaven bless this country with sam rayburn s continue service here for year to come remark of hon wayne l hay of ohio mr hay it be a matter of deep personal satisfaction for i to add i voice to the great and distinguish chorus of i colleague in this paean of praise respect and affection for speaker sam rayburn in this hour of crisis the wisdom the dedication the stabilize force that he represent in current american government be an almost indispensable source of strength he have become in this half century the grand old man of american history it seem to i that the prayer of the whole free world must rise like some vast petition to providence that sam rayburn s vigor and he life remain undiminished through the come decade here briefly in this humble tribute i have seek for some simple and succinct summation that would define the immense service of this patriot to he country but the task be beyond i because i hold it impossible to compress in a sentence or two the complicate and prodigious contribution sam rayburn have make a an individual a a legislator a a statesman and a a leader and conciliator to the majestic progress of this nation it happen that i be a legislator from ohio and that i feel deeply about the need the aspiration the interest of i district and i state what sam rayburn s life prove to we all be the magnificent lesson in political science that one can devotedly and with absolute dedication represent the seemingly provincial interest of one s own community one s own district one s own state and by that help himself represent even good the sweep and scope of the problem of this the great nation of all time for sam rayburn never forget bonham he home community and he never forget texas in the same way i like to think we owe we loyalty a legislator to we community we district we state and if we follow the rayburn pattern a consciously or by an instinctual political sense i like to think i have follow it then the very nature of we loyalty to we own immediate area must necessarily be reflect in the devotion of we service to we country for what sam rayburn s life in this house teach we be that loyalty and character be not divisive and there be no such thing a be for you country and neglect you district there be no such thing a be diligent about national affair but indifferent about home need the two be a one this may not be the great but it certainly come close to be the great lesson sam rayburn s career up to this hour teach all of we who would aspire to distinction in political life under we process of government more than that sam rayburn be the very live symbol of an iron-clad integrity so powerful in he nature and so constantly demonstrate that he can count some of he good friend in the opposition through the most rancorous battle of political controversy and the most bitterly fight national and presidential campaign he character shine a an example of dignity and honesty forthrightness and nobility sam rayburn have never have to look back at any of he most devastate fight and ever feel ashamed of he conduct a a combatant under fire or he political manner in the heat of conflict ambition this mean much to the american tradition it be an answer in it way individual and highly dramatic to the charge that the democratic process be necessarily vicious in it campaign characteristic and the name rayburn be one of the most dominant in the history of american politics for the last half century it be i insist hard to define the rayburn contribution to we political civilization because it be so massive and so widespread and so complicate and because it go so deep but this we know here be a great life that in every area of american politics give the american people occasion for pride and that have invest the democratic process with the most decent quality of honor decency and self-respect i pray to god that he may be spare to we for many year to come for this be an influence the unite state and the whole world can ill afford to lose remark of hon melvin price of illinois mr price all but two of i nine term in the house of representative have be serve under the speakership of sam rayburn of this i be proud i have a distinct admiration for this man we honor today because of the humility with which he carry he greatness and sam rayburn be a great man one who will go down in american history a a truly great leader of the nation he will be consider not only great among he contemporary but a great among all the american who have play a part in the country s history since the begin i pay i personal tribute to sam rayburn stalwart texan and great american not only because today he establish a record of have serve a speaker of the house of representative more than twice a long a henry clay but because of the contribution he have make to the welfare of the people of the nation during he almost half century of service a a member of congress speaker rayburn have not limit he leadership a a statesman to he direction of the house in the speaker s chair he have an outstanding record a a legislator since the start of he career in the house in 1913 the 63d congress no one have sponsor more progressive and important legislation than have sam rayburn he be the recognize father of the rural electrification administration and the security and exchange commission but to run the gauntlet of the program sam rayburn bring into be through he legislative effort would fill the page of today s record no great pleasure have come to i in i own service in this house than to be present today to participate in this tribute to this great speaker this great legislator this great texan this great american i sincere wish be that he continue to add to this record he set here today remark of hon john s monagan of

of many of the progressive social measure which adorn we statute book today and of he cooperation in time of adversity with president of both of we major party in help to pilot the ship of state through the shoal of today s stormy international sea i prefer to speak however of sam rayburn the person rather than sam rayburn the american institution although sam rayburn affect a gruff exterior in many instance nevertheless he be fundamentally a man of warm heart and gentle disposition no one could be more devote than he to the american congress a an institution and more aware of it historical significance in the political history of the world and i shall never forget he move talk deliver in simple yet eloquent word upon the mean of we job a representative in the operation of
