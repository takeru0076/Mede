one day the child have want to get up onto general burnside s horse they want to see what he back feel like the general s he look so comfortable be straight they want to touch the mystery arlene be boost they up when the policeman come by he be very rude arlene have a hard voice too this time the policeman s eye rather pop for a second but then arlene get another tone in a hurry and she say if it be nt for these dear child the policeman get a confuse funny look on he face and he have answer kind of politely now look here lady i know you get to entertain these kid and all but this be a public park and it s a city ordinance that the statue can not be crawl on arlene be so ashamed that she hang she head when she say yes sir the policeman walk on but he look back once that have happen on the day when two other unusual thing have occur arlene have teach they a new way to have fun in they little private area and they have tell they mother about the tumble in matter of exact information that keep she one step behind development and so they be consistently true to they principle never mind arlene have say after the policeman have leave have pursue the usual unco-operative course of grownup never mind i know something that be much more fun that we can do on we little lawn what be it ask the child whose reflex and reply be invariably so admirably normal and predictable maybe that be why they be cordial and loyal towards the unpredictability of arlene just you wait advise arlene echo the dialogue in a recent british movie and when they have get to they little lawn they have have a most twirlingly magnificent time first arlene have put they through some rapid somersault they have protest that that be nt any surprise just you wait say arlene again a though she be discover the pleasantly tingle insinuation of that handy little sturdy statement this be a warm-up be it anything like cooked-over oatmeal ask one of the child not the least bit arlene snap one of the many thing that be so nice about she be that she always take you question seriously particularly you very very serious question those be especially the one that all other grownup laugh at loud she would sometimes even get a little hard on you she take you so seriously but not hard for very long just long enough to make you feel important now say arlene eventually make they both sit in formation on a big root of a live oak the sort of root that divide itself and make they bottom sag down and feel comfortable now we re go to be like what general burnside and he horse make we think of the child look at each other and sag they bottom down even more comfortably than ever they curiosity go happily out of bound then arlene throw herself backwards and wiggle in a way that be just wonderful she hold herself that way and turn she head towards they and laugh and wink imagine be able to laugh and wink when you re like the top part of that picture frame at home one of they say they both laugh and wink back i m general burnside s horse upside down arlene say sort of gaspingly for she even she have to breathe kind of funny when she be in that position she make general burnside s horse s belly do so funny when it be upside down then she be back on she foot wink and smile that enormous smile she have lot of wonderful big tooth that you never would have suspect she have when she be not smile and she would wink and throw kiss they both try to keep smile and wink for a long time but it make they lip and eyelid tremble but they keep on clap for a long long time this time arlene say and she even keep on wiggle a little bit while she be just talk you re go to tell i what i be and what i m do it all have something to do with general burnside and he horse this time it be so grand they could tell exactly what it be it be general burnside s horse run in a circle he leg shake and the shake go right on up he body through he hip to he shoulder that s the general s horse one of they cry out the other remark in a happy laughter that s a funny old horse the first one say he sure do shake he s old then there be the general kiss he wife they have to be tell that one but it be even funny after they have be tell they father when he come back from those many business trip just bump they mother on the forehead with he lip and ask if anybody have think to mix the martini and put they in the electric icebox but not general burnside he be the funny man he never could keep still even when he do nt move he foot then they have to get up and be general burnside or he horse all they could think of be to run around in circle kick they leg out it be nt very funny then they say general burnside be go to jump over he horse s head and they do some somersault but that be nt very funny either you ought to shake arlene advise they and arlene show they how to begin she also teach they to sing i wish i could shimmy like i sister kate that help a lot they be clumsy but they be begin to catch on they also catch on a little bit on how to smile a lot without you lip tremble imagine you will nt get you allowance if you re catch not smile or smile with you lip tremble too much arlene suggest that help a great deal they be a little late in get home i m sorry mrs mink arlene say in a tone so low you could hardly hear it i mother constitute herself the voice of all of we it s perfectly understandable arlene i mother say in a friendly way i suppose you all be play and forget yes maam the child chorus heartily we could nt help laugh the child rush off to get rid of they sweater and arlene begin tap the kitchen door open arlene s a good girl i uncle remark to we but he say it too soon for it come out just before the tap to which the door respond that tap have a slight bangish quality she really be a dear little thing i mother agree she upper lip lift slightly she be bite into a small red radish and that action always cause she to lift she lip from the sting of the thing also she live in continual fear of find a white worm curl up in a neat mean little heap at the white center of the radish she would try to see over the bulge of she cheek and somewhat under she tooth to the place where she be bite it never work naturally but it make she look unusual also when she have bitten off half of the small radish she find the suspense unbearable and she would snatch the finger-held half of the radish out to where she could inspect it one could hear a very faint ladylike sigh of relief actually it be inaudible to anyone not expect it but the warm joy of she word eye be open to the general public late on the child tell she far about somersault it must be awfully good for they and awfully kind of arlene she tell we late but do you know something curious she add i reach into that funny little pocket that be high up on i dress i have no notion why i reach and i find a radish be it an omen i think for a second but i would not pamper myself in that silly way i open the window and throw the radish out then i mother blush at this small lie for she know and we know that it be cowardice that have make one more radish that night just too impossible a strain arlene become indispensable nobody could have tell why but she be it be in the air a friend of i father s come to dinner he be pass through town and phone to say hello a a result he be persuade out to dinner a a matter of fact this happen every four or five month sometimes he coincide with i father s be at home sometimes a at this juncture he do not but he be always persuade out he like child in a loathsome kind of way the two young in we family always have to be bring in and put through trick for he entertainment when he have leave i could never remember whether he have poke they in they middle laughingly with a thick index finger or whether he be merely so much the sort of person who do this that one assume the action not bother to look the child loathe he too this even they be push in from the breakfast room with odds and end of dessert distribute over they there have be some coconut in it for i remember i mother s take a quick glance at a stringy bit of this nut on the cheek of one of they and then put down she radish with a shiver they be push gently into the room by arlene whose only part appear be hand that creep quickly back around to the kitchen side of the door we have just sit down tell mr gorboduc what you re do these day i mother advise the child ceremonially there be an air of revolt about the child even irreverence for they own principle this could be tell chiefly from a sort of head-tossing and prance a horselike balkiness of demeanor possibly the coconut-containing dessert have bring up bitter problem of administration but at the begin this stay just in the air we go to the park with this nice lady one of they say we have good time this happy bulletin convulse mr gorboduc you do he ask between wheeze of laughter he be force to wipe he eye you do nt step on the flower do you eh one of the child maneuver out of range of the poke index finger no he say we do nt mr gorboduc take a swig of he sherry he be so long think that i mother have time to inspect she sherry for dregs usually this be do when attention be divert by someone else s long boring story but this time she be nervous she be open mr gorboduc be finally in command of he mind again tell i what do you do at the park he ask this be deliver in a forthright way without coyness and over-pretended interest an admirable way with child only unfortunately he could not remove from he voice a nag insinuation of the direct command this nettle the child into the revelation of exact truth a sacrifice of they secret superiority over grow people but a victory in the wide field of perpetration and illegitimate accomplishment we bump one say and the other go on to development of the idea we grind too he say i mother be beside herself with curiosity say that again she plead she laugh a little and toss the dregs rakishly around in she glass you what she could see that mr gorboduc be intrigue the hostess in she take over she be rollickingly happy you what i uncle look at mr gorboduc he read henry jame and use to pretend profundity through eye-beamings at people mr gorboduc look down he would not look up he be very funny about the whole thing
