when they say that under no circumstance would it ever be right to permit the termination of the human race by human action because there could not possibly be any proportionate grave reason to justify such a thing they know exactly what they mean of course in prudential calculation in balance the good directly intend and do against the evil unintended and indirectly do no great precision can be forthcoming than the subject allow yet it seem clear that there can be no good sufficiently great or evil repel sufficiently grave to warrant the destruction of mankind by man s own action i mean however that the moral theologian know what he mean by permit he be not talk in the main about probability risk and danger in general he be talk about an action which just a efficaciously do an evil thing and be know certainly and unavoidably to lead to this evil result a it efficaciously do some good he be talk about double effect of which the specific action cause directly the one and indirectly the other but cause both of which one be deliberately will or intend and the other not intend or not directly intend but still both be do while the evil effect be with equal consciousness on the part of the agent foreknown to be among the consequence this be what in a technical sense to only permit an evil result mean it mean to do it and to know one be do it but a only a secondary if certain effect of the good one primarily do and intend of course grave guiltiness may be impute to the military action of any nation or to the action of any leader or leader which for any suppose good permit in this sense the termination of the human race by human action certainly in analyze an action which truly face such alternative it be never possible that no world would be preferable to some world and there be in truth no circumstance in which the destruction of human life present itself a a reasonable alternative naturally where one or the other of the effect of an action be uncertain this have to be take into account especially be this true when because the good effect be remote and speculative while the evil be certain and grave the action be prohibit presumably if the reverse be the case and the good effect be more certain than the evil result that may be forthcoming not only must the good and the evil be prudentially weigh and find proportionate but also calculation of the probability and of the degree of certainty or uncertainty in the good or evil effect must be take into account there must not only be great good than evil objectively in view but also great probability of actually do more good than harm if an evil which be certain and extensive and immediate may rarely be compensate for by a problematic speculative future good by the same token not every present certain and immediate good or lesser evil that may have to be do will be outweigh by a problematic speculative and future evil nevertheless accord to the traditional theory a man begin in the midst of action and he analyze it nature and immediate consequence before or while put it forth and cause these consequence he do not expect to be able to trammel up all the future consequence of he action above all he do not debate mere contingency and therefore if these be possibly dreadful find himself force into inaction he do what he can and may and must without regard himself a lord of the future or on the other hand a cover with guilt by accident or unforeseen consequence or by result he do not permit in the sense explain by contrast a good deal of nuclear pacifism begin with the contingency and the probability and not with the moral nature of the action to be do and by derive legitimate decision backward from whatever may conceivably or possibly or probably result whether by anyone s do or by accident it find itself drive to inaction to non-political action in politics and non-military action in military affair and to the not very surprise discovery that there be now no distinction on which the defense of justice can possibly be base mr philip toynbee write for example that in term of probability it be surely a likely a not that mutual fear will lead to accidental war in the near future if the present situation continue if it continue indefinitely it be nearly a statistical certainty that a mistake will be make and that the devastation will begin against such a termination of human life on earth by human action he then propose a an alternative that we negotiate at once with the russian and get the good term which be available that we deliberately negotiate from comparative weakness he bravely attempt to face this alternative realistically ie by consider the bad possible outcome namely the total domination of the world by russia within a few year this would be by far the good choice when it be a question of allow the human race to survive possibly under the domination of a regime which most of we detest or of allow it to destroy itself in appal and prolong anguish nevertheless the consequence of the policy propose be everywhere subtly qualify it be a possible result however improbable the bad and least probable result if it do nt prevail mankind would still be give the opportunity of prevail for surely anything be good than a policy which allow for the possibility of nuclear war if we have not think and make a decision entirely in these term then we need to submit ourselves to the follow simple test have we decide how we be to kill the other member of we household in the event of we be less injure than they be thus moral decision must be entirely deduce backward from the likely eventuality it be no long to be formulate in term of the nature of present action itself it intention and proximate effect or the thing to be do several of the reply to mr toynbee without conscious resort to the traditional terminology with regard to the permission of evil succeed in restore the actual context in which present moral and political decision must be make by distinguish between choose a great evil and choose in danger of this evil it be bad for a nation to give in to evil than to run the risk of annihilation i be consciously prepare to run the continue risk of race suicide by accident rather than accept the alternative certainty of race slavery by design but i can only make this choice because i believe that the risk need not increase but may be deliberately reduce by precaution against accident or by limit war quote mr kennan s phrase that anything would be good than a policy which lead inevitably to nuclear war he toynbee say that anything be good than a policy which allow for the possibility of nuclear war if ask to choose between a terrible probability and a more terrible possibility most man will choose the latter if philip toynbee be claim that the choice lie between capitulation and the risk of nuclear war i think he be right i do not accept that the choice be between capitulation and the certainty of nuclear war even professor arnold toynbee agree with he son do so in these term compare to continue to incur a constant risk of the destruction of the human race all other evil be lesser evil let we therefore put first thing first and make sure of preserve the human race at whatever the temporary price may be mr philip toynbee affirm at one point that if he share the anticipation of orwell in nineteen eighty-four if he believe communism be not only evil but also irredeemably evil then he might think it right to do anything rather than to take the risk of a communist world even a nuclear holocaust be a little less frightful to contemplate than a race of dehumanise human occupy the earth until doomsday no political order or economic system be so clearly contrary to nature but one do not have to affirm the existence of an evil order irredeemable in that sense or a static order in which no change will take place in time to be able truthfully to affirm the follow fact there have never be justitia imprint in social institution and social relationship except in the context of some pax-ordo preserve by clothe or naked force on they way to the heavenly city the child of god make use of the pax-ordo of the earthly city and acknowledge they share in responsibility for it preservation not to repel injury and uphold and improve pax-ordo mean not simply to accept the misshapen order and injustice that challenge it at the moment but also to start down the steep slope along which justice can find no place whereon to stand toynbee seem to think that there be some other way to give justice social embodiment i would far rather die after a russian occupation of this country by some deliberate act of refusal than die uselessly by atomisation would such an act of refusal be useful he do not mean in fact he address himself specifically to reject the proposition that if we take the risk of surrender a new generation in britain would soon begin to amass it strength in secret in order to reverse the consequence of that surrender he want to be brutally frank and say that these rebellion would be hopeless far far more hopeless than be the hungarian revolution of 1956 this be not a project for regain the ground for limit war by create a monopoly in one power of the world s arsenal of unlimited weapon it be a proposal that justice now be serve by mean other than those that have ever precondition the search for it or precondition more positive mean for attain it in the past it be no good recommend surrender rather than nuclear warfare with the proviso that surrender could be follow by the effective military resistance by occupy people hope for the future would lie in the natural long of the human race for freedom and the right to develop this be to surrender in advance to whatever attack may yet be mount to the very last it be to stride along the steep slope downward the only contrary action in the future a in the past run the risk of war and now and in the future unlike in the past any attempt to repel injury and to preserve any particular civilize attainment of mankind or it provisional justice run some risk of nuclear warfare and the danger that an effect of it will by human action render this planet less habitable by the human race that be why it be so very important that ethical analysis keep clear the problem of decision a to permit effect and not draw back in fright from any conceivable contingency or suffer paralysis of action before possibility or probability unrelated or not directly morally relate to what we can and may and must do a long a human history endure finally just a no different issue be pose for thoughtful analysis by the foreshorten of time that may yet pass before the end of human life on this earth but only stimulation and alarm to the imagination the same thing must be say in connection with the question of what we may perhaps already be do by human action to accelerate this end we should not allow the image of an immanent end bring about indirectly by we own action in the continue human struggle for a just endurable order of existence to blind we to the fact that in some measure accelerate the end of we lease may be one consequence among other of many other of mankind s thrust toward we know not what future
