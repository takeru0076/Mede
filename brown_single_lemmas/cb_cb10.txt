miami fla march 17 an out-of-town writer come up to paul richards today and ask the oriole manager if he think he ball club would be improve this year now richards of course be know a a deep thinker a baseball manager go he can often make the complex ridiculously simple and vice versa this happen to be vice versa but even so the answer be a masterpiece it s a whole lot easy he say to increase the population of nevada than it be to increase the population of new york city and with that he walk off to give instruction to a rookie pitcher that be undoubtedly a hell of a quote say the writer scratch he head now if i can just figure out what he s talk about i ll use it two spot open this be just richard s way of say that last year the bird open spring train with a lot of job wide open some brilliant rooky nail they down so that this spring just two spot leave and right field be really up for grab it should be easy to plug two spot than it be to fill the wholesale lot that be open last year but so far it have nt work that way this angle of just where the oriole can look for improvement this year be an interest one you d never guess it from the way they ve play so far this spring but there remain a feel among some around here that the oriole still have a chance to battle for the pennant in 1961 obviously if this club be go to move from second to first in the american league it will have to show improvement someplace where can that improvement possibly come from you certainly can nt expect the infield to do any good than it do last year robby could be good brook robinson be great and it be conceivable that he ll do even good in 1961 than he do in 1960 you can nt expect it though robby s performance last year be tremendous it s the same with ron hansen and jim gentile if they do a well a they do in 1960 there can be no complaint they should nt be ask to carry any more of the burden hansen will be get a late spring train start which might very well set he back he get off to an exceptional start last season and under the circumstance probably will nt duplicate it there be some club which claim they learn something about pitch to he last year they do nt expect to stop he just slow he down some with the bat he ll still be a top player they concede because he s get a great glove and the long ball go for he but they expect to reduce he over-all offensive production breed might move up gentile can hardly do good than drive in 98 run do nt ask he more i have a hunch marv breed might move up a notch but even so he have a good year in 1960 and will nt do too much good so all in all the infield can nt be expect to supply the add improvement to propel the bird from second to first and the pitch will also have trouble do good richards get a great performance out of he combination of youth and experience last season where then can we look for improvement from triandos brandt and walker answer richards they re the one we can expect to do good the man be right and at this time indication be that these three be ready for good season triandos have nt prove it yet but he say he s convince he thumb be all right he jam it this spring and have have to rest it but he say the old injury have nt bother he if he can bounce back with one of those 25 home run year the club will have to be good off offensively i m still not convince though i ll have to see more of he before predict that big year for he hank foiles back up by frank house who will be within call distance in the minor make up good second line catch than the bird have all last year but gus be still that big man you need when you start talk pennant to i brandt look a though he could be in for a fine year he have nt play too much because richards have be work on he furiously in bat practice he s hit the ball hard in the bat cage and he whole attitude be improve over this time last year when he come to baltimore he be leave a team which be suppose to win the national league pennant and he be join what seem to be a second division american league club he be down hard to talk to and far too nonchalant on the field a of now that all seem behind he he s be entirely different all spring and walker look strong seem to be throw good than he do last year let he bounce back and he could really set up the staff so if the oriole be to improve brandt triandos and walker will have to do it so far the platoon on leave and right fielder do nt seem capable of carry the load of course this be nt take into consideration the population of nevada and new york city but it s the way thing look from here at this point be the mother of an autistic child at fault the autistic child be one who seem to lack a well-defined sense of self he tend to treat himself and other people a if they be object and sometimes he treat object a if they be people do he mother make he this way some people believe she do we think differently we believe that autism like so many other condition of defect and deviation be to a large extent inborn a mother can help a child adapt to he difficulty sometimes she can to a large extent help he overcome they but we do nt think she create they we do nt think she can make she child defective emotionally disturb or autistic the mother of a difficult child can do a great deal to help she own child and often by share she experience she can help other mother with the same problem since little be know about autism and almost nothing have be write for the layman we d like to share one experience mother s comment she write total disinterest a the mother of an autistic child who be lack in interest and enthusiasm about almost anything i have to manipulate i son s finger for he when he first play with a new toy he want i to do everything for he you do nt believe that autistic child become autistic because of something that happen to they or because of the way they mother treat they but i do and i psychiatrist do too i know that i son want control and direction but be autistic myself i can not give full control or direction one thing i notice which i have seldom hear mention this be that autistic people do nt enjoy physical contact with other for instance i child and i when i hold i son he stiffen he whole body in i arm until he be a straight and stiff a a board he push and straighten himself a if he can nt stand the feel of be hold physical contact be uncomfortable for he this mother be quite correct a a rule the autistic child do nt enjoy physical contact with other parent have to find other way of comfort he for the young child this may be no more than provide food light or movement a he grow old it may be a matter of provide some accustom object he magic thing or certain word or ritual that child and adult go through may do the trick the answer be different for each autistic child but for most there be an answer only ingenuity will uncover it what future hold dear doctor we learn this year that we old son daniel be autistic we do not accept the diagnosis at once but gradually we be come to fortunately there be a nursery school which he have be able to attend with a group of normal child i try to treat daniel a if he be normal though of course i realize he be far from that at present what i do be to try to bring he into contact with reality a much a possible i try to give he a many normal experience a possible what be you experience with autistic child how do they turn out late many autistic child grow up to lead relatively normal life certainly most continue to lack a certain warmth in communication with other people but many adjust to school even college to job and even to marriage and parenthood single-color use question a first grader color picture one solid color everything sky grass boy wagon etc when different color be use she be just a likely to color tree purple hair green etc the other child in the class use this same colore book and do a fairly good job with thing they proper color should i show i daughter how thing should be colore she be an aggressive nervous child be a relax home atmosphere enough to help she outgrow these trait answer she choice of one color mean she be simply enjoy the motor act of colore without have reach the point of select suitable color for different object this immature use of crayon may suggest that she be a little immature for the first grade no colore be nt exactly something you teach a child you sometimes give they a little demonstration a little guidance and suggestion about stay inside the line but most learn to color and paint a and when they be ready with only a very little demonstration see in decorate circle of late be a renew interest in an old art embroidery possibly responsible for this be the income trend toward multicolor scheme in room which seem slate to replace the one-color look to which we have be accustom just a a varitinted oriental rug may suggest the start point for a room scheme so may some of the new version of embroidery one such in fact be a rug though not actually crewel embroidery it have that look with it over-stitched raise pattern in blue pink bronze and gold and a sauterne background the twirl stylized design of wind stem and floral form strongly suggest the embroider pattern use so extensively for upholstery during the jacobean period in england traditional crewel embroidery which seem to be appear more frequently this fall than in the past few year be still available in this country the work be execute in england by hand and can be work in any desire design
