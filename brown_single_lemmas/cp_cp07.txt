spencer say nothing be there any word you would like to offer in you own defense spencer shake he head alexander say answer i properly spencer spencer be quiet for a moment long then he say there be nothing i want to say captain very well alexander walk away naval procedure he think have it moment of grim humor philip spencer have cold-bloodedly plan the murder of he captain yet it seem in order to chide he for a lapse of proper address during the morning hour it become clear that the arrest of spencer be have no sober effect upon the man of the somers those name in the greek paper be manufacture reason to steal aft under pretence of some call of duty so a to be near spencer watch an opportunity to communicate with he hostile glance be flash at both alexander and gansevoort the two meet in the captain s cabin what be the next step captain more arrest i fear in you opinion who be this e andrew on the certain list cromwell of course he be the old and most experience of the lot he see the danger not the glory of be identify a a mutineer somehow he talk spencer into let he use another name there be a tap at the door and oliver enter with the word that heiser wish to see the captain have he come in heiser breathless and wild-eyed bring the chill news that the handspikes heaver and holystones have be mysteriously remove from they customary place and also sir two article which be consider souvenir now must be regard in another light entirely an african knife and battle-ax be at this moment be sharpen by mckinley and green mckinley be overhear to say that he would like to get the knife into spencer s possession and that where do you gather all this information heiser who report to you the disappearance of handspikes and heaver and who he be interrupt by a crash from the deck and spring toward the ladder with gansevoort and heiser behind he a glance reveal that the main topgallant mast have be carry away the aimless mill about of what have be a well-trained well-organized crew strike alexander with horror he bellow order and watch the alert response of some of he man and watch too the way a dozen or more turn they head questioningly toward the shackle figure a though for far instruction adrien deslonde hasten to alexander s side small violently jerk the weather-royal brace with full intention to carry away the mast i see he myself and it be do after consultation with cromwell i swear it sir and it be clear that adrien be not mistake for both small and cromwell take no step toward aid in the send up of the new topgallant mast till philip spencer have give the signal to obey then with disappointment evident upon they face they move to the work alexander guess that they have plan confusion and turmoil think it the ideal climate in which to begin battle and bloodshed they strategy be sound enough and he reason have be defeat only by philip spencer s unwillingness to sanction an idea he have not originate when the mast be raise alexander give the order for small and cromwell to be place under arrest and now three figure in iron sprawl upon the open deck and terror stalk the somers spencer s potential follower be openly sullen and morose miss muster without excuse express in ominous tone they displeasure at the prisoner be keep in iron communicate with the three by glance and signal one of the miss handspikes come out of it hide place after midshipman tillotson have be insolently disobey by seaman wilson tillotson have report the man to gansevoort and an hour late with back turn have be attack by wilson brandish the weapon wilson shackle and snarl be throw with the other prisoner and be soon join by green mckee and mckinley not a man on the brig loyal or villainous could be unaffected by the sight of seven man involve in the crime of mutiny in the tiny cabin alexander meet with gansevoort heiser and wale to speak and to listen three day have pass since spencer s arrest and each day have bring new danger new fear gansevoort say it require an omniscient eye to select those if any on whom we can now rely to have the greek paper be not the great help that at first flush it seem from action aboard it be easy to guess that spencer s boast of twenty staunch follower be a modest estimate well heiser venture why do nt we hold an investigation with question and that would be bad than useless alexander break in there be not space to hold or force to guard any increase number of prisoner besides suppose we hold a court of inquiry then what then we have inform a large number of we crew that when they reach the unite state they will be punish but that in the meanwhile they may run loose and be expect to perform they job in good order mr heiser do this sound like a truly workable plan to you do you not think these man might choose the black flag here and now wale say of course they would they be about to do so at any moment a it be all that be need be for one man to feel self-confident enough to take the lead a soon a that one man be appoint by himself or the other or by a signal from spencer we be go to be rush we be go to be rush and murder that be extravagant language mr wale we be not go to be rush and murder alexander say we be go to bring the somers into new york harbor safe and sound of course i agree with the captain gansevoort say thoughtfully but the conspiracy be ferocious and desperate the instinct of discipline have be lose anything be possible when anarchy have the upper hand he pause then add everything on a ship be a weapon implement of wood and iron be available for close and hasty combat no matter where a man stand and we be positive of so few and suspicious of so many we ourselves must stand sentinel alexander say under arm day and night watch and watch about those of we present the perry brother deslonde and the other midshipman now have the responsibility of the somers a great deal of labor we have a well for we be too uncertain of where trust may be place and when he be alone again in the cabin alexander lower he head into he arm and weep for he know full well what must be do what in the end would be do with all he heart he have love the navy and now he must act in accordance with the navy s implacable law and when he do when he give to he ship that protection necessary to preserve she honor he know he would lose forever the navy to which he have dedicate he soul where have he fail how have he fail he who have try so hard who have yearn so passionately to be a great officer it come to he a he weep there aboard the somers that it be a foolish to strive for greatness a to seek to storm the gate of heaven it be give or it be not give one do one s good and if fortune smile there be a reward one do one s good and if fortune frown an eighteen-year-old boy with murder in he heart sail aboard one s ship and alexander sob like a girl for the dream he have have and he feel no shame god know he tear be he to shed if he so desire for it have not be with an egotist s rage for fame that he have hold precious he naval career another field have give he fame enough to satisfy any egotist it be for love that he have serve the navy to have someday that love return be what he have live for now the hope be go yes he would bring the somers safely into new york harbor but at a price dear god at what a price and after a while he dry he tear and walk the deck a a captain should with assurance and dignity stern-faced he inspect the prisoner satisfy himself that they be clean well feed and comfortable within reason the prisoner avert they eye but not before he have glimpse hatred and anger only cromwell the giant boatswain be mild-mannered and respectful he say captain may i speak please captain i be innocent of any plot against you or the ship be you cromwell yes sir before god i swear i be innocent i know nothing of any plot if there be such a thing you be the only man aboard who can be in doubt i can not speak for other sir but i be innocent he lean close to alexander squint up at he from the deck surely captain you do not find i name on any suspicious paper or anything no cromwell i do not find you name you be careful about that now spencer seem with effort to shake himself from lethargy speak he say cromwell be tell you the truth he be innocent alexander shift he gaze to spencer the calmness and detachment of he tone suggest unawareness of how implicit be he own guilt in the word he have use to defend cromwell alexander know spencer too well to think he naive or thick-skulled and in a sudden wave of painful clarity alexander recognize a kinship with spencer here be another human who understand the stupidity of quarreling with the inevitable there be good fortune and there be bad and philip spencer in handcuff and ankle iron know it to be a truth he expect nothing for himself but that which naturally follow those mark for misfortune the red-haired captain tower above the prisoner a a symbol of decency and authority be shock to find himself look with sympathy upon philip spencer this tragic lad have forge he own shackle but he could not have do so could not have find the way have fortune favore he and because fortune have favore neither the prisoner nor the red-haired captain they would be each other s undo spencer if there be guilt if you do not deny you own how be it possible for cromwell to be innocent he be you constant companion the hazel eye meet alexander s i tell you he be innocent and do you think there be a reason why i should accept you word yes i have nothing to gain by defend cromwell nothing to lose either spencer that s true spencer agree and withdraw himself from the conversation he eye go back to contemplation of the sea i be innocent captain cromwell say again before god captain i be innocent and though it be logical that a man who could plot mass murder would not hesitate to speak an untruth still it be difficult to understand why spencer speak only for cromwell the boatswain be a guilty a any no action of he could be interpret in he favor and four midshipman prior to they know the significance of the greek paper have see it in cromwell s hand while spencer whisper explanation i think midshipman rogers have tell alexander that spencer be teach he geometry it be fantastic to turn from the seven man in shackle to the wardroom where a class of apprentice await he this be a train ship and the train would continue but there be an element of frightful absurdity here which alexander recognize some of these apprentice be in physical strength already man and doubtless a percentage of they be spencer s follower
