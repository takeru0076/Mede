of a sleep capsule a crutch he rarely use and do nt awaken until early afternoon memory flood he the instant he open he eye and the sick feel knot he stomach outside he window bloom a beautiful summer day presumably the same sun be shine upon little draw also and those who have kidnap he but where it be still a very big world despite all the modern cant to the contrary hub be sit in a chair that

she expect i to hub shake he head so andy tell he not to bother the only reason for contact lissa be to comfort or to be comfort he could not manage the former or expect the latter they have nothing to give to each other the omission might look peculiar to outsider but andy could not bring himself to go through the motion simply for the sake of appearance he have little time to himself anyway a the afternoon speed toward even the suite see a steady procession of paxton aide pass in and out each with he own special problem thornburg arrive with the writer they have spend the morning revise the act eliminate all the gay song patter and dance with a view of the good public relation what remain lack the original verve but it be at least dignified a befit the tragic circumstance raymond fox report that the orchestra have hastily rehearse cradle song in case it be need charlie marble be back and forth on several occasion first to confer with andy on the advisability of cancel the la vegas engagement they decide it be wise and late to announce that a prominent comedian also an agency client have agree to fill the casino s open date and once bake slip in pale and draw last night s liquor still on he breath with some of today s add to it he ask if there be anything he could do andy invent a job to keep he busy send he ahead to el dorado to supervise last minute arrangement but from rocco vecchio they hear nothing at last it be time to depart hub nose about spot reporter in the lobby so andy be hustle away quietly through the hotel s service entrance in a strange car which hub have procure somewhere they succeed in elude the curious at the hotel but there be no chance of avoid they at the nightclub el dorado be surround by a mob they overflow the park lot make progress by automobile difficult long before he reach the protection of the stage door andy be recognize word of he arrival spread through the crowd like a brushfire they surge around he finger point eye pry it be not a hostile gather but andy sense the difference from last night s hero-worshippers they have come not to admire but to observe it s bad inside thornburg inform andy skolman s jam in every table he could find under the head of it s an ill wind et cetera backstage be tomblike by contrast andy s co-worker keep they distance awe by the tragedy but in he dress room be a large bouquet and a card that read we re with you all the way it be sign by everyone in the troupe andy could nt help but be touch he instruct shirl winter to compose a note of thank to be post on the call board bake be wait

install to film the audience the reservation list be be check out name by name and a special detail be already at work in the park lot scrutinize automobile for a possible lead however it be virtually impossible to screen the mob outside even if bonner have manpower available for the purpose i want you to have the speaker take out andy sigh seem like we re never go to see eye to eye lieutenant do nt they tell you what i want the pa system for sure i know but it s such a long shoot no long than yours what do you expect to get tonight anyway you think somebody be go to stand up in the audience

either someday bonner say you re go to ask we for help i can hardly wait what you do nt understand be that i m ask for it now but bonner depart still full of ill will he have get stick with a job too big for he imagination he have to cling to routine test procedure to act otherwise would be to admit he helplessness but admit or not bonner be helpless the crime show too much plan the kidnapper appear too proficient to be catch by a checklist andy s performance be schedule for eleven oclock he stall for a half-hour long hope to hear something from vecchio about the ransom money bake and shirl winter on separate telephone could not reach he at any conceivable location in los angeles nor could they secure any clear-cut information regard he effort bake curse the sweaty bastard s probably halfway to peru with we money by now when no one smile he feel constrain to add just kid natch thornburg pop in to advise andy skolman s send up smoke signal you about ready what s he complain about bake ask they re drink be nt they no we get a bunch of sippers out there tonight i guess nobody want to pass out and miss anything thornburg add in a low voice but andy overhear they act more like a jury than an audience andy say well i guess we can nt wait any long hub you stick by the stage door if rock show up during the number or you hear anything give i the signal shirl winter say i ll stay on the phone mr paxton there s a couple of call-backs i can work on you re a sweetheart but leave one line open he may try to phone we andy pass into the corridor they good luck follow he it be what they say before every performance but tonight it sound different a if he really need it they be right the act cut to shred and hastily patch together during the afternoon have not be rehearse sufficiently by anyone the result have nothing of the polish pace or cohesion of the previous night here s where luck would normally step in but this be no ordinary show and andy know it whether he sing well or badly have nothing to do with it the audience have come not to be entertain but to judge twenty-four hour have change he from a performer to a freak within this framework what follow be strain even macabre eliminate the patter and the upbeat number leave little but blue and other song of equal melancholy the effect be a depress a a gravestone the applause irresolute and short-lived yet andy plow ahead mouth the inconsequential word a if they possess real mean and gradually he listener warm to he they clap grow more fervent the even be still not beyond salvage not a a show but for he a a person the bad be yet to come a andy reach the finale of he act a subdue commotion backstage draw he attention to the wing rocco vecchio a perspire haggard vecchio be stand there flank by two man in the uniform of armored transport guard vecchio be nod and point at the large suitcase he hold andy feel he heart thud heavily with relief he wave at fox to cut off the finale introduction the music die away discordantly he draw a deep breath lady and gentleman in place of i regular close number tonight i d like to sing something of a different nature for you ray if you please the cradle song he sense rather than hear the gasp that sweep across the audience nor could he blame they this particular song at this particular time could only be interpret a the ultimate in bad taste callous exploitation beyond the bound of decency have no choice he plunge into it anyway hold onto the microphone for support lullaby and goodnight he voice shake for the first time in he life he forget the lyric midway through and have to cover up by hum the rest he wonder if the audience would let he finish they do though contemptuous they be still polite but when he be finally through they scorn be make apparent someone clap tentatively then quickly stop otherwise the silence be complete a the light come up andy could see that a number of patron be already on they way toward the exit he stumble off-stage i god he mutter i god hub be there to support he it s okay mr paxton the money s here all of it at this moment all he could think of be what he d be force to undergo do you hear they do you know what they think of i bunch of damn jerk hub growl who need they thornburg pat he arm sure andy it ll be all right nothing break that can nt be mend the word be hollow thornburg know good than any of they that a public image be a fragile a humpty dumpty all the king s horse and all the king s man vecchio shoulder in i get it andy god know how but i get it you ll never believe the place i ve be today i practically have to sign you life away you ll probably fire i for some of the deal i have to go for but andy nod dully it do nt matter rock we ve do we part he clutch that knowledge to he a he return to he dress room the usual congratulatory crowd be conspicuously absent the place have the air of a morgue andy have no desire to linger himself but hub report that the mob outside be still large despite the effort of the police to disperse they
