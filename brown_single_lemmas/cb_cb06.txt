easily observe picture of the missouri-illinois countryside st louis sit in the center of a relatively slow-growing and in some place stagnant mid-continent region slacken regional demand for st louis goods and service reflect the region s relative lack of purchase power not all st louis industry of course have a market area confine to the immediate neighborhood but for those which do the slow growth of the area have a retard effect on the metropolitan core the city have a stake in stimulate growth and purchase power throughout outstate missouri and southern illinois gov dalton s new commerce and industry commission be move to create a nine-state regional group in a collective effort to attract new industry that be one approach another would be to take the advice of dr elmer ellis

development corp have obtain a $ 500000 loan to help defray the cost of remodeling a city-owned factory to accommodate production that will provide 500 new job carbondale be in the herrin-murphysboro-west frankfort labor market where unemployment have be substantially high than the national average the federal program eventually should have a favorable impact on missouri s depress area and in the long run that will benefit st louis a well politics-ridden st clair county in illinois present another piece of the problem of metropolitan development more industrial acreage lie vacant in st clair county than in any other jurisdiction in the st louis area the unstable political situation there represent one reason new plant shy away from the east side and then there be st louis county where the democratic leadership have show little appreciation of the need for sound zoning of the important relationship between proper land use and economic growth st louis county under it present leadership also have largely close it eye to the need for governmental reform and permit parochial interest to take priority over area-wide interest some plant-location specialist take these sign to mean st louis county do nt want industry and so they avoid the area and more job be lose metropolitan st louis s relatively slow rate of growth ought to be a priority concern of the political business civic and other leader on both side of the mississippi without a great acceleration in the metropolitan area s economy there will not be sufficient job for the grow number of youngster and st louis will slip into second-class status an excess of zeal many of we very good friend be reformer still we must confess that sometimes some of they go too far take for example the reformer among new york city s democrat have whip mr de sapio in the primary and thus come into control of tammany hall they have change the name to chatham hall even though headquarters actually have be move into the chatham build do they believe that they can make the new name stick grant that the tammany name and the tammany tiger often be regard a badge of political shame the sachems of the hall also have a few good mark to they credit but it be tradition rather than the record which balk at the expunging of the tammany name after all it go back to the day in which sedition be not un-american the day in which the son of st tammany conspire to overthrow the government by force and violence the british government that be far do we reform friend really believe that the cartoonist will consent to the banishment of the tiger from they zoo they will when they give up the donkey and the elephant instead of attempt the impossible why not a publicity campaign to prove that all the tiger s stripe be not black that might go over the faget case the white house itself have take step to remove a former batista official col mariano faget from he preposterous position a interrogator of cuban refugee for the immigration service the faget appointment be preposterous on several ground the kennedy administration have assure anti-castro cuban that it would have nothing to do with associate of dictator batista use a batista man to screen refugee represent a total misunderstanding of the democratic force which alone can effectively oppose castro moreover col faget s information on cuba be too outdated to be useful in screen castro agent the colonel flee to the friendly haven of the dominican dictatorship a soon a castro seize power and while he have head batista s anti-communist section the batista regime do not disturb the communist so much a more open opponent who be allege to be communist responsibility for the faget appointment rest with gen jm swing an eisenhower appointee a head of the immigration service gen swing have receive public attention before this for abuse of some of the prerogative of he office he official term expire last summer some report say he be rescue from timely retirement by he friend congressman walter of pennsylvania at a moment when the kennedy administration be diligently search for all the house vote it could get congressman walter have be all-powerful in immigration matter but he have announce plan to retire in 1962 at that point the administration will have little reason to hang onto gen swing the faget case be the kind of salvage job the administration should not have to repeat mr eisenhower politician a president dwight d eisenhower often assume a role aloof from the strife of partisan politics a a former president however mr eisenhower abandon this role to engage in partisan snipe during a new york republican rally and generally miss he target mr eisenhower seize upon the incident of the postcard lose by a peace corps girl in nigeria to attack the entire corps a a juvenile experiment and to suggest send a corps member to the moon this be juvenile ridicule nowhere do the speaker recognize the serious purpose of the corps or it welcome reception abroad he word be the more ungracious to come from a man who lend he name to the eisenhower exchange fellowship dedicate to the same goal of international understand the former president blithely ignore recent history in speak of dollarette dollar under kennedy administration fiscal policy it be the eisenhower administration which produce the large peacetime deficit finally mr eisenhower find nothing but confusion in washington this statement recall the 1959 berlin crisis when president eisenhower first tell reporter that berlin could not be defend with conventional weapon and then add that a nuclear defense be out of the picture too the crisis have be renew since then but the confusion have hardly be compound ex-president relieve of accountability for policy sometimes seem to feel free of accountability for they word some of former president truman s off-the-cuff discourse have be in that vein nobody can deny the right of former chief executive to take part in politics but the american people expect they always to remember the obligation of national leadership and to treat issue with a sense of responsibility this be a matter of respect for the presidency mr eisenhower s new york speech do not encourage respect for that or for he elder statesmanship queen of the sea the queen mary have long be a symbol of speed luxury and impeccable british service on the high sea report that the venerable liner which have be in service since 1936 be to be retire strike a nostalgic note in many of we but the cunard line influence by unpleasant economic fact and not sentiment have decide to keep the queen mary in service until next spring at least a new queen with the prosaic title of q3 have be plan for several year to replace the queen mary the british government concern about the threat of unemployment in the shipbuilding industry have put through a bill to give cunard loan and grant totaling $ 50400000 toward the $ 84000000 cost of a new 75000-ton passenger liner since 1957 more and more trans-atlantic passenger have be cross by air economy class fare and charter flight have attract almost all new passenger to the airline competition from other steamship line have cut cunard s share of sea passenger from one-third to one-fourth and this year the line show a mark drop of profit on the atlantic run the cunard line have under consideration replace the queen mary with a ship small than 75000 ton this would be cheap to operate and could be use for cruise during the lean winter month also under consideration be an increase investment in cunard eagle airway which have apply to serve new york the decline of the cunard line from it position of dominance in atlantic travel be a significant development in the history of transportation mission to viet nam gen maxwell taylor s statement in saigon that he be very much encourage about the chance of the pro-western government of viet nam turn back communist guerrilla attack come close to an announcement that he will not recommend dispatch unite state troop to bolster the vietnamese army gen taylor will report to president kennedy in a few day on the result of he visit to south viet nam and judge from some of he remark to reporter in the far east he be likely to urge a more efficient mobilization of vietnamese military economic political and other resource there be good reason for gen taylor to make an inspection trip at this time communist guerrilla recently have be report increase they activity and the great flood of the mekong river have interpose a new crisis south viet nam s rice surplus for next year more than 300000 ton may have be destroy the viet cong the communist rebel may have lose they store grain and arm factory the rebel may try to seize what be leave of the october harvest when the flood recede and the monsoon end in november nothing that be likely to happen however should prompt the send of unite state soldier for other than instructional mission the indochina struggle be a war to stay out of in 1954 when gen ridgway estimate it would take a minimum of 10 to 15 division at the outset to win a war the french be lose it be a war to stay out of today especially in view of the fact that president ngo dinh diem apparently do not want unite state troop he may want additional technical help and this should be forthcoming south viet nam have receive $ 1450000000 in unite state aid since 1954 and the rate of assistance have be step up since vice president lyndon b johnson s visit last may gen taylor the president s special military adviser be a level-headed officer who be not likely to succumb to propaganda or pressure it be probable that he recommendation will be inform and workable and that they will not lead to involve the unite state in an asian morass gov john m dalton himself a lawyer and a man of long service in government speak with rich background and experience when he say in an address here that lawyer ought to quit sit in the missouri general assembly or quit accept fee from individual and corporation who have controversy with or ax to grind with the government
