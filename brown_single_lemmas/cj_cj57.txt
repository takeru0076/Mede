some who have write on utopia have treat it a a learn diversion of a learn world a phantasy with which more amuse himself a holiday work a spontaneous overflow of intellectual high spirit a revel of debate paradox comedy and invention with respect to this view two point be worth make first it appear to be base on the fact that on it title page utopia be describe a festivus gay it overlook the other fact that it be describe a nec minus salutaris quam festivus no less salutary than gay it also overlook the fact that in a rational lexicon and quite clearly in more s lexicon the opposite of serious be not gay but frivolous and the opposite of gay be not serious but solemn more believe that a man could be both serious and gay that a writer who be gay can not be serious be a common professional illusion sedulously foster by all too many academic who mistakenly believe that they frivolous effort should be take seriously because they be express with that dreary solemnity which be the only mode of expression they author be capable of secondly to find a learn diversion and a please joke in more s account of the stupid brutality of early sixteenth century war of the anguish of the poor and dispossess of the insolence and cruelty of the rich and powerful require a callousness toward suffer and sin that would be surprise in a moral imbecile and most surprise in more himself indeed it be even surprise in the canon of christ church and regius professor of ecclesiastical history who father this most peculiar view and in the brilliant professor of medieval and renaissance english at cambridge who inherit it and be now it most eminent proponent but to return to the main line of we inquiry it be doubtful that utopia be still widely read because more be medieval or even because he be a martyr indeed it be likely that these day many who read utopia with interest do not even know that it author be a martyr utopia be still widely read because in a sense more stand on the margin of modernity and if he do stand on the margin of modernity it be not in die a martyr for such unity a papal supremacy might be able to force on western christendom it be not even in write latin epigram sometimes bawdy one or in translate lucian from greek into latin or in defend the study of greek against the attack of conservative academic or in attack the conservative theologian who oppose erasmus s philological study of the new testament similar literary exercise be the common doing of a christian humanist of the first two decade of the sixteenth century have more s writing be wholly limit to such exercise they would be almost a dimly remember a those of a dozen or so other author live in he time whose work tenuously survive in the mind of the few hundred scholar who each decade in pursuit of they very specialize occasion read those work more stand on the margin of modernity for one reason alone because he write utopia and the evidence that he do indeed stand there derive quite simply from the vigorous interest with which rather casual reader have respond to that book for the past century or so only one other contemporary of more s evoke so immediate and direct a response and only one other contemporary work niccolo machiavelli and the prince can we discover what it be in utopia that have evoke this response remember that in seek the modern in utopia we do not deny the existence of the medieval and the renaissance there we do not even need to commit ourselves to assess on the same inconceivable scale the relative importance of the medieval the renaissance and the modern the medieval be the most important to chamber because he seek to place thoma more the author of utopia in some intelligible relation with st thoma more the martyr to other whose concern it be to penetrate the significance of christian humanism the renaissance element be of primary concern but here we have a distinctly modern preoccupation we want to know why that book have keep on sell the way it have we want to know what be perennially new about utopia what be new about it to that question the answer be simple it can be make in two word utopian communism but it be an answer which open the door wide to an onrush of objection and denial surely there be nothing new about communism we find it in plato s republic and in utopia more acknowledge he debt to that book we find it in that common way of life please to christ and still in use among the true society of christian that be the good monastery which make it easy to convert the utopian to christianity we find it in the late stoic conception of man s natural condition which include the community of all possession this conception be take up by the early church father and by canon lawyer and theologian in the middle age and more be far too well read not to have come across it in one or several of the form thus give it but although the idea of communism be very old even in more s day and do not spring full-clad from he imagination in 1515 it be not communism a such that we be concern with we be concern not with the genus communism nor with other species of the genus platonic stoic early christian monastic canonist or theological communism we be concern with utopian communism that be simply communism a it appear in the imaginary commonwealth of utopia a more conceive it perhaps one way to sharpen we sense of the modernity of utopian communism be to contrast it with the principal early type of communistic theory we will achieve a more vivid sense of what it be by realize what it be not in plato s republic communism be to speak anachronistically a communism of janissary it function be to separate from the base rule mass among whom private ownership prevail the govern warrior elite moreover it be too readily forget that in the republic what give the initial impetus to plato s excursus into the construction of an imaginary commonwealth with it ruling-class communism of goods wife and child be he quest for a canon for the proper order of the individual human psyche and it be to this problem that the republic ultimately return in more s utopia communism be not a mean of separate out a warrior elite from the lumpish mass utopian communism apply to all utopian and in the economy of the book it be not peripheral but central the concern of utopia be with the optimo reipublicae statu the good order of a civil society and it be again and again make clear that utopian communism provide the institutional array indispensible to that good order to derive utopian communism from the jerusalem christian community of the apostolic age or from it medieval successors-in-spirit the monastic community be with an appropriate shift of adjective mislead in the same way a to derive it from plato s republic in the republic we have to do with an elite of physical and intellectual athlete in the apostolic and monastic community with an elite of spiritual and religious athlete the apostolic community be literally an elite choose by christ himself and the monastic community be suppose to be make up of volunteer select only after a novitiate which would test they religious aptitude for monastic rigor they spiritual athleticism finally the conception of the natural community of all possession which originate with the stoic be firmly fix in a tradition by more s time although it be not accept by all the theologian-philosophers of the middle age in that tradition communism lie a safe distance back in the age of innocence before the fall of man it do not serve to contrast the exist order of society with a possible alternative order because the age of innocence be not a possible alternative once man have sin the actual function of patristic communism be adequately set forth by st gregory almost a millenium before more write utopia the soil be common to all man when we give the necessity of life to the poor we restore to they what be already theirs we should think of it more a an act of justice than compassion because community not severalty of property be the law of nature no man can assert an absolutely unalterable right to what be he indeed of all that be he every man be by nature and reason and therefore by conscience obligate to regard himself a a custodian he be a trustee for the common good however feeble the safeguard which the positive or municipal law of property provide against he misuse of that share of the common fund wisely or unwisely entrust to he keep in contrast to this stoic-patristic view utopia imply that the nature of man be such that to rely on individual conscience to supply the deficiency of municipal law be to embark on the bottomless sea of human sinfulness in a sieve the utopian brace conscience with legal sanction in a properly order society the massive force of public law perform the function which in natural law theory ineptly be leave altogether to a small voice so often still in all the respect just indicate utopian communism differ from previous conception in which community of possession and live play a role neither from one of these conception nor from a combination of they can it be deduce we do not deny originality to the agamemnon because aeschylus find the tale of the house of atreus among the folk lore of the greek in a like sense whatever bit or shred of previous conception one may find in it utopian communism remain a an integral whole original a new thing it be not merely a new thing it be one of the very few new thing in utopia most of the rest be medieval or humanist or part of an old tradition of social criticism but to say that at a moment in history something be new be not necessarily to say that it be modern and for this statement the good evidence come within the five year follow the publication of utopia when martin luther elaborate a new perception of the nature of the divine s encounter with man new indeed be luther s perception but not modern a anyone know who have ever try to make intelligible to modern student what luther be get at although utopian communism be both new in 1516 and also modern it be not modern communism or even modern socialism a they exist or have ever exist in theory or in practice consider the feature of utopian communism generous public provision for the infirm democratic and secret election of all officer include priest meal take publicly in common refectory a common habit or uniform prescribe for all citizen even house change once a decade six hour of manual labor a day for all but a handful of magistrate and scholar and careful measure to prevent anyone from shirk no private property no money no sort of price at all for any goods or service and therefore no market in the economic sense of the term whatever the merit of it intent utopian communism be far too naive far too crude to suit any modern socialist or communist it be not the detail of utopian communism that make utopia modern it be the spirit the attitude of mind that inform those detail what that spirit and attitude be we can good understand if we see more precisely how it contrast with the communist tradition with the long continuous history the one which reach christianity by the way of stoicism through the church father of late antiquity
