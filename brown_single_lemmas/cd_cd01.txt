a a result although we still make use of this distinction there be much confusion a to the mean of the basic term employ just what be mean by spirit and by matter the term be generally take for grant a though they refer to direct and axiomatic element in the common experience of all yet in the contemporary context this be precisely what one must not do for in the modern world neither spirit nor matter refer to any generally agreed-upon element of experience we be in a transitional stage in which many of the connotation of former usage have have to be revise or reject when the word be use we be never sure which of the traditional meaning the user may have in mind or to what extent he revision and rejection of former understanding correspond to ours one of the most widespread feature of contemporary think be the almost universal disbelief in the reality of spirit just a few century ago the world of spirit be a populous and real a the world of material entity not only in popular think but in that of the highly educate a well be this true demon fairy angel and a host of other spiritual being be a much a part of the experiential world of western man a be rock and tree and star in such a world the word matter and spirit both refer to directly know reality in the common experience of all in it important element of christianity and of the biblical view of reality in general which now cause we much difficulty could be respond to quite naturally and spontaneously the progress of science over these last few century and the gradual replacement of biblical by scientific category of reality have to a large extent empty the spirit world of the entity which previously populate it in carry out this program science have undoubtedly perform a very considerable service for which it can claim due credit the objectification of the world of spirit in popular superstition have certainly go far beyond what the experience of spirit could justify or support science be fully competent to deal with any element of experience which arise from an object in space and time when therefore it turn it attention to the concrete entity with which popular imagination have people the world of spirit these entity soon lose whatever status they have enjoy a actual element of external reality in do so science have unquestionably clear up widespread misconception remove extraneous and illusory source of fear and dispel many undesirable popular superstition there have be indeed many important and valuable gain from the development of we present scientific view of the world for which we may be rightly grateful all this have not however be an unmixed bless the scientific debunk of the spirit world have be in a way too successful and too thorough the house have be sweep so clean that contemporary man have be leave with no mean or at good with wholly inadequate mean for deal with he experience of spirit although the particular form of conceptualization which popular imagination have make in response to the experience of spirit be undoubtedly defective the raw experience itself which lead to such excess remain with we a vividly a ever we simply find ourselves in the position of have no mean for inquire into the structure and mean of this range of we experience there be no framework or structure of think with respect to which we can organize it and no part of reality a we know and apprehend it with respect to which we can refer this experience science have simply leave we helpless and powerless in this important sector of we life the situation in which we find ourselves be bring out with dramatic force in arthur miller s play the crucible which deal with the salem witch trial a the play open the audience be introduce to the community of salem in puritan america at the end of the eighteenth century aside from a quaint concern with witch and devil which provide the immediate problem in the open scene it be a quite normal community the conversation of the character create an atmosphere suggest the usual mixture of pleasure foible irritation and concern which would characterize the common life of a normal village in any age there be no occasion to feel uneasy or disturb about these people instead the audience can sit back at ease and from the perspective of an enlighten time which no long believe in such thing enjoy the dead seriousness with which the character in the play take the witch and devil which be under discussion a teenage girl abigail william be be sharply question by she minister uncle the reverend samuel parris about a wild night affair in the wood in which she and some other girl have seem to have have contact with these evil being for all involve in this discussion the devil be a real entity who can really be confront in the wood on a dark night the demon world be populate with real creature and witch actually can be see fly through the air a the play unfold however the audience be subtly bring into the grip of an awful evil which grow with ominously gather power and soon engulf the community everyone in salem saint and sinner alike be sweep up by it it be like a mysterious epidemic which start first with abigail and parris spread inexorably with a dreadfully grow virulence through the whole town until all have be infect by it it grow terribly and unavoidably in power and leave in it wake a trail of misery moral disintegration and destruction the audience leave the play under a spell it be the kind of spell which the exposure to spirit in it live active manifestation always evoke if one ask about this play what it be that come upon this community and work within it with such terrible power there be no good answer to give than spirit this be not to attempt to say what spirit be but only to employ a commonly use word to designate or simply identify a common experience in the end the good man john proctor express what the audience have already come to feel when he say a fire a fire be burn i hear the boot of lucifer i see he filthy face the tragic irony of the play be that the very belief in and concern with a devil who could be meet in the wood and combat with formula set out in book be the very thing that prevent they from detect the real devil when he come among they we marvel at they blindness for not see this yet be not we of the mid-twentieth century who rightly do not believe there be any such thing a the devil just a bad off a they only in a different way in we disbelief we think that we can no long even use the word and so be unable to even name the elemental power which be so vividly real in this play we be leave helpless to cope with it because we do not dare speak of it a anything real for fear that to do so would imply a commitment to that which have already be discredit and prove false even mr miller himself seem uncertain on this score in a long commentary which he have insert in the publish text of the first act of the play he say at one point however that experience never raise a doubt in he mind a to the reality of the underworld or the existence of lucifer s many-faced lieutenant and he belief be not to he discredit good mind than hale s be and still be convince that there be a society of spirit beyond we ken page 33 on the other hand a little late on he say since 1692 a great but superficial change have wipe out god s beard and the devil s horn but the world be still grip between two diametrically oppose absolute the concept of unity in which positive and negative be attribute of the same force in which good and evil be relative ever-changing and always join to the same phenomenon such a concept be still reserve to the physical science and to the few who have grasp the history of idea when we see the steady and methodical inculcation into humanity of the idea of man s worthlessness until redeem the necessity of the devil may become evident a a weapon a weapon design and use time and time again in every age to whip man into a surrender to a particular church or church-state page 34 apparently he do not intend that those who read or view this play should think of the devil a be actually real yet such be the dramatic power of he write that the audience be nevertheless leave in the grip of the terrible power and potency of that which come over salem it cast a spell upon they so that they leave with a feel of have be in the mysterious presence of an evil power it be not enough in account for this feel to analyze it into the wickedness of individual people add together to produce a cumulative effect for this do not account for the integral elemental power of that which grow with abound vigor a the play unfold nor do it explain the strange numinous sense of presentness which come over those who watch the play like a spell the reality of spirit emerge in this play in spite of the author s conviction to the contrary spirit and community there be nothing in the whole range of human experience more widely know and universally feel than spirit apart from spirit there could be no community for it be spirit which draw man into community and give to any community it unity cohesiveness and permanence think for example of the spirit of the marine corps surely this be a reality we all acknowledge we can not of course assign it any substance it be not material and be not a thing occupy space and time yet it exist and have an objective reality which can be experience and know so it be too with many other spirit which we all know the spirit of nazism or communism school spirit the spirit of a street corner gang or a football team the spirit of rotary or the ku klux klan every community if it be alive have a spirit and that spirit be the center of it unity and identity in search for clue which might lead we to a fresh apprehension of the reality of spirit the close connection between spirit and community be likely to prove the most fruitful for it be primarily in community that we know and experience spirit it be spirit which give life to a community and cause it to cohere it be the spirit which be the source of a community s draw power by mean of which other be draw into it from the world outside so that the community grow and prosper yet the spirit which life in community be not identical with the community the idea of community and the idea of spirit be two distinct and separable idea one characteristic of the spirit in community be it givenness the member of the community do not create the spirit but rather find it present and wait for they it be for they a give which they and they alone possess the spirit of the marine corps be present and operative before any of the present member of it come into it it be they of course who keep it alive and preserve it so the same spirit will continue to be present in the corps for future recruit to find a they come into it
