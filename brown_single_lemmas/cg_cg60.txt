to meltzer the scholar who then become automatically meltzer the butcher meltzer be a boarder with the bank family he come to fleischmanns directly from the boat that bring he to america from russia he be a learn man and a very gentle soul he be fill with knowledge of the bible and the talmud he know the whyfores and the wherefore but he be weak very weak on the therefores bank the butcher take meltzer the scholar a an apprentice and he make it very clear that a man of learn must be able to do more than just quote the commentary of the talmud in order to live so meltzer learn a new trade from bank who supply the town and the hotel with meat bank have a family a wife a daughter and a son the daughter lilly be a very good friend of i and i always have hope that someday she and meltzer would find each other they live in the same house and it do nt seem to be such a hard thing to do but the sad reality of lilly s life and the fact that meltzer do nt love she never satisfy i wishful think bank the butcher be a hard master and a hard father a man who do nt seem to know the difference between the live flesh of he family and the hang carcass of he stock in trade he treat both with equal indifference and with equal contempt perhaps he be a little more sympathetic to the side of beef that hang silently from he hook lilly bank and i become friend she be the opposite of everything she should have be a positive pole in a negative home a live reaction of warmth and kindness to the harsh reality of she father and lilly s whole family seem to be an apology for mr bank she brother karl be a very gentle soul she mother be a quiet woman who say little but who have hard probe eye for every rude word of mr bank s the family have five in apology every chance i get i leave the hotel to visit lilly i be free but she be bind to she duty that not even the come of meltzer lighten she have to clean the glass on the display case in the butcher shop help she brother scrub the cut table with wire brush mop the floor put down new sawdust on the floor and help check the outgoing order when these chore be finish only then be she allow whatever freedom she could find i help lilly in the store to i it be a game to she it be the deadly seriousness of life i want to help so that we could find time to play and lilly allow i to help so that she could have she few little hour of escape when the work be finish we would walk the road past the butcher shop take we along the side of a stream it run north away from the town and the people through wood and past the nothingness of a graveyard lilly prefer the loneliness of that walk i would have like the town and the busyness of it people but i always follow lilly into the peace of the silent and unstaring road it be nt hard to understand to i lilly be a fine and lovely girl to people who do nt know she she be a gawky badly dress kid whose arm be too long whose leg be a little too bony she have the hip of a boy and a loose-jointed walk that remind i of a string of bead stroll down the street and she have the kind of cross eye that shock it be unexpect unexpect because lilly walk with she head bend down down and she mark of friendship be to look into you face i accept she cross eye a she accept i childishness childishness compare to she grown-up understand that life be a punishment for a yet undisclosed sin we be almost the same age she be fifteen i be twelve and where i feel there be a life to look forward to lilly feel she have have a much of it a be necessary when we go for we walk lilly s brother would come along every once in a while karl be an almost exact copy of he father physically and it be strange to see the expect become the unexpect this huge hulk play the guitar and he would take it along on we walk and play for we a we sit alone in the wood or by the stream karl play well and he favorite song be a schubert lullaby he speak no german but he could sing it and the word of the song be the only one he know in a foreign language the song he say be call the stream s lullaby and when he sing gute ruh gute ruh macht die augen zu there be such long and such simple sadness that it frighten i late when i be old i find the song be part of schubert s die schone mullerin and even hear it in a concert hall surround by hundreds of people the word and the melody would make i a little cold and i would reach out for i husband s hand the brother and sister seem to be a sort of mutual-aid society a little fortress of kindness for each other in a hard world i feel very flatter to be include in the protection of they company even though i have nothing to be protect from
