draw a line across the country at the latitude of low pennsylvania any house build now below that line without air condition will be obsolete in 10 year fortunately it be the fha which have arrive at this conclusion for it mean that cool equipment of all kind may now be include in a mortgage and thus acquire with a minimum of financial stress even if you live above that line the fha will back you for they have decide that the inclusion of air condition in all new home be a good thing and should be encourage new simplify package unit recently devise prefabricate glass-fiber duct and improve add-on technique make it possible to acquire a system for an 1800-square-foot house for a little a $ 600 to $ 900 two man can often do the installation in a day you can install it yourself this be a central system that will cool every part of you house it upkeep no less an authority than the fha concur that the saving air condition make possible more than offset it operate cost be it worth-while home air condition have come a long way from the early day of overcooled theaters and the thermal shock they inflict we know now that a 15-degree differential in temperature be the maximum usually desirable and accurate control assure the comfort we want we know too that health be never harm by summer cool on the contrary there be fewer cold and small doctor bill the filter air benefit allergy asthma sinus hay fever control of temperature and humidity be a godsend to the age and the invalid heart condition and high blood pressure escape the stress bring on by oppressive heat housekeeping be easy the clean air mean less time spend push a vacuum fewer trip to the dry cleaner light load for the wash machine the need for reupholstering redecorate repaint become more infrequent clothe hold they shape good and mildew and rust become almost forget word it will improve you disposition when you re less fatigue thing just naturally look bright the child can have they daytime nap and hot meal and be put to bed on schedule in shade-darkened room you ll sleep long and good too awake refresh and free of hot weather nerve you can forget about screen and leave the storm window up all year around good of all central air condition be something you can afford like it long-lived cousin the refrigerator a conditioner can be expect to last 20 to 25 year or more that bring it per-year cost down mighty low for any house no matter what style you home be ranch two-story colonial or contemporary central air condition be easily install the equipment will nt take up valuable space either it can go in out-of-the-way waste space but there s no deny that the easy and most economical way to get year-round whole-house air condition be when you build if that s do the house can be design and orient for good operation and this can mean saving both in the size of equipment and in the cost of the house itself if you can nt see you way clear to have summer cool include when build by all mean make provision for it easy add late manufacturer have design equipment for just such circumstance and you saving over start from scratch will be substantial if you house be to have a force warm air system cool can be a part of it this cost less than have a completely separate cool system for you regular heat ductwork filter and furnace blower do double duty for cool you can get year-round air conditioner in the same variety of style in which you buy a furnace alone high or low boy horizontal or counterflow the unit can be install in basement attic crawlspace or in a closet locate in the live area the cool coil be locate in the furnace s outlet from the coil small copper pipe connect to a weatherproof refrigeration section set in the yard garage carport or basement if you plan to add cool late to you heat system there be thing to watch for be sure duct that require insulation get it when they be install they may be inaccessible late be sure you duct and blower be big enough to handle cool this be especially important if you live in a mild-winter zone be sure you get a perimeter heat system and diffuser that will work a well for cool a they do for heat you can get a hot water system that will also work for cool you house for cool chill water be circulate instead of hot water instead of radiator you ll have cooling-heating unit each with it own thermostat these system be more expensive than year-round force air system the minimum cost for an average one-story 7-room house with basement be likely to run $ 1500 above the cost of the heat alone separate system if the problem of combine cool with you heat be knotty it may be cheap to plan on a completely separate cool system the simple kind of separate system use a single self-contained unit it be in effect an oversize room conditioner equip with prefab glass-fiber duct to distribute the cool clean dehumidified air where it be want in a long rambling ranch two such unit can be install one serve the live area the other the sleep zone in a two-story house one unit may be install in the basement to serve the first floor another in the attic to cool the second in each case have separate system for live and sleep area have the advantage of permit individual zone control the heat pump one of the more remarkable of the new cool system be one that can be switch to heat a you know a conditioner make indoor air cool by pump the heat out of it and then release this heat outdoors a relatively simple switch arrangement reverse the cycle so that the machine literally run backward and the heat be extract from outdoor air and turn indoors up until recently this heat pump method of warm air be efficient only in area of mild winter and when outside temperature be above 40 degree now the machine have be improve to a point where it be generally more economical than oil heat at temperature down to 15 degree you can get this add heat feature for a little a $ 200 more than the price of cool alone consider it a a standby setup at negligible cost for those emergency when the furnace quit a blizzard hold up fuel delivery or for cool summer morning or evening when you do nt want to start up you whole heat plant what size conditioner how large a cool unit you need and the method of it installation depend on a variety of factor among other thing besides the nature of you house and how much heat find it way into it various room from the outside it will depend upon you personal habit and the makeup of you family family with child usually do nt want the house quite so cool if you be a party thrower you may need add capacity the body be a heat machine and 20 to 25 guest can easily double you cool load cool requirement be good express in term of afj a btu be a unit of heat and the btu rate of a conditioner refer to how much heat you machine can pump out of you house in an hour a very rough rule of thumb be that under favorable condition you ll need 15 btu s of cool for every square foot of you house this be if outdoor temperature have a high average of 95 degree you ll need more if the high average be above that less if it s below cooler be also rate by ton a ton of cool compare to the cool you get by melt a ton of ice by accept definition a 1-ton conditioner will provide 12000 btu of cool in one hour you may find a conditioner rate by horsepower it be generally an inaccurate method of rate for the horsepower be that of the compressor motor and many other component beside it determine how much cool you ll get a 1-hp conditioner for example may vary in effectiveness from under 8000 btu to well over 10000 afj the safe procedure be to let you builder estimate the size of the unit you need rather than try to do this yourself do nt urge you builder to give you a little extra cool capacity just to be sure you have enough good to have you equipment slightly undersized than too big here s why reduce humidity be often a important a cool an oversize unit will cool off you house quickly then shut down for a long period before it cycle on again humidity can build up and make you uncomfortable even though the temperature be still low with a unit of the right size a compressor will run continuously during hot weather reduce humidity a evenly a it do temperature money-saving tip attention to detail can cut in half the size unit you need and pare operate expense proportionately a well-designed 1200-square-foot house can be comfortably cool and heat for a little a $ 128 a year or $ 11 a month if you have a house which heat do nt penetrate easily you unit will have less heat to remove keep the direct sun from reach the house and you ve win the first battle in a new house generous roof overhang be a logical and effective solution if the house you plan to buy or build will nt have big overhang you can still do a fair job of keep the sun off wall and window with properly design trellise fence and awning shade tree too be a big help so keep they if you can draw blind and drapery do some good but not nearly a much a shade device on the outside of the house the more directly the sun strike wall and roof the great it heat impact the way a house be set on it lot can therefore influence how much cool you re go to need a shift in the wall or a change in the roof slope so the sun hit they more obliquely can save you money you can use heat-absorbing glass to stop the sun double glass and insulate glass to combat condensation restrict large glass area to the north and south side of the house they re easy to shade there an attic space above insulation make a house easy to cool you ll even gain by put you water heater outside the condition space and use an electric range instead of a gas one gas add to the moisture load insulate weatherstrip double-glaze to the maximum in insulation the number to remember be 6-4-2 they stand for 6 inch of mineral wool insulation in the ceiling 4 inch in the side wall 2 inch in the floor such extra-thick insulation not only permit a much small cool installation but will continue to reduce operate expense both in heat and cool a light-colored roof will reduce sun heat by 50 per cent it cost two to three time a much to remove a btu in summer a it do to add one in winter so every solitary btu be worth attention you ll foil they in drove along with they pal humidity by have and use a kitchen range exhaust fan a bathroom ventilator for when you shower and an outside vent for the clothe dry keep conditioner quiet it s no use pretend that all conditioner be quiet but the noise they produce can be keep to a minimum good workmanship be important in the installation so if you re do you own contract do nt award the job on the basis of price alone avoid attic placement directly above a bedroom
