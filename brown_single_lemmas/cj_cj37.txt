an analysis of the election fall naturally in four part first be the long and still somewhat obscure process of preparation plan and discussion preparation begin slightly more than a year after independence with the first step to organize rural commune all political interest support electoral plan although there be some sign that the inherent uncertainty of a popular judgment lead to some procrastination the second major aspect of the election be the actual procedure of registration nomination and vote considerable technical skill be use and the administration of the election be generally above reproach however the regionally differentiate result which appear below in table be interest evidence of the problem of develop self-government under even the most favorable circumstance a third aspect and probably the one open to most controversy be the result of the election the electoral procedure prevent the ready identification of party affiliation but all vitally interest party include the government itself be busily engage in determine the party identification of all successful candidate the month follow the election the fourth and conclude point will be to estimate the long-run significance of the election and how they figure in the current pattern of internal politics election have figure prominently in nearly every government program and official address since independence they be stress in the speech of si mubarak bekkai when the first council of minister be form and again when the istiqlal take a lead role in the second council king muhammad 5 be know to be most sympathetic to the formation of local self-government and make the first firm promise of election on may day 1957 there follow a long and sometimes bitter discussion of the feasibility of election for the fall of 1957 in which it appear that the minister of the interior take the most pessimistic view and that the istiqlal be something less than enthusiastic since the complicate process of establish new commune and review the rudimentary plan leave by the french do not even begin until the fall of 1957 this goal appear somewhat ambitious from the very begin the electoral discussion raise fundamental issue in moroccan politics precisely the type of question that be most difficult to resolve in the new government until the charter of liberty be issue in the fall of 1958 there be no guarantee of the right to assemble or to organize for political purpose the istiqlal be still firmly unite in 1957 but the pdi parti democratique de lindependance the most important minor party at the time object to the istiqlal s predominance in the civil service and influence in radio maroc there be rumor that the ministry of the interior favore an arbitrary non-political process which be indirectly affirm when the king personally intervene in the plan meeting the day follow he intervention the palace issue a statement reassure the citizen that the possibility of introduce appeal concern the establishment of electoral list list of candidate and finally the hold of the consultation itself would be support by the king himself the ifni crisis in the fall of 1957 postpone far consideration of election but french consultant be call in and notice of far investigation appear from time to time in january 1958 the minister of the interior announce that an election law be ready to be submit to the king the rumor of election date appear once again first for spring of 1958 and late for the summer although the government be probably prepare for election by mid-1958 the first decision be no doubt make more difficult a party strife multiply in late 1957 the mp mouvement populaire appear and in the spring of 1958 the internal strain of the istiqlal be reveal when the third council of government under balafrej be form without support from progressive element in the party the party be on the whole unprepared for election while the people be still experience post-independence let-down and suffer the after-effect of poor harvest in 1957 despite the internal and international crisis that harass morocco the election remain a central issue they figure prominently in the balafrej government of may 1958 which the king be reportedly determine to keep in office until election could be hold but the eagerly seek homogeneity of the balafrej council of government be never achieve a the istiqlal quarreled over foreign policy labor politics and economic development by december 1958 when abdallah ibrahim become president of the council election have even great importance they be increasingly look upon a a mean of establish the new rural commune a the focus of a new constructive national effort to minimize the chance of repeat the balafrej debacle the ibrahim government be form a titre personnel and a special office be create in the ministry of the interior to plan and to conduct the election by this time there be little doubt but what election plan be complete there remain only the delicate task of maneuvering the law through the labyrinth of palace politics and make a small number of policy decision from the rather tortuous history of electoral plan in morocco an important point emerge concern the first election in a develop country and evaluate they result in the new country the electoral process be consider a a mean of resolve fundamental and sometimes bitter difference among leader and also a a source of policy guidance in the absence of a reservoir of political consensus each organize political group hope that the election will give they new prominence but in a system where there be a yet no place for the less prominent lack the respect and effective institution that consensus help provide minority party such a the pdi in 1957 and the progressive istiqlal faction in 1958 clamor for election when out of power but be not at all certain they wish to be control by popular choice when in power those in power tend to procrastinate and even to repudiate the electoral process the tendency to treat election a an instrument of self-interest rather than an instrument of national interest have two important effect on electoral plan in morocco at the central level the scrutin uninominal vote system be select over some form of the scrutin de liste system even though the latter have be recommend by duverger and favore by all political party the choice of the single member district be dictate to a certain extent by problem of communication and understand in the more remote area of the country but it also serve to minimize the national political value of the election although the election be for local official it be not necessary to conduct the election so a to prevent party from publicly identify they candidate with multiple member district the still fragmentary local party organization could have operate more effectively and party might have be encourage to state they position more clearly both party and the ministry of the interior be busily at work after the election try to unearth the political affiliation of the successful candidate and thereby give the election a confidential but know degree of national political significance since a national interpretation can not be avoid it be unfortunate that the election be not hold in a way to maximize party responsibility and the educational effect of mass political participation the general set of the moroccan election may also encourage the deterioration of local party organization the concentration of effective power in rabat lead not only to party bicker but to distraction from local activity that might have have many auxiliary benefit in addition to contribute to more meaningful election interest evidence can be find in the result of the chamber of commerce election which take place three week before national election the istiqlal-sponsored umcia lunion marocaine des commercants industrialistes et artisan be oppose by candidate of the new unfp lunion national des force populaire in nearly all urban center a the more conservative group with strong back from wealthy businessman the umcia be generally favore against the more progressive labor-based unfp the new party campaign heavily while the old more confident party expect the moroccan merchant and small businessman to support they a they have do for many year the local istiqlal and umcia office do not campaign and lose heavily the value of the election be lose both a an experiment in increase political participation and a a reliable indicator of commercial interest a show in table 1 the chamber of commerce election be of course an important event in the preparation for rural commune election the unfp learn that it urban organization which depend heavily on umt support be most effective the istiqlal find that the spontaneous solidarity of the independence struggle be not easily transpose to the more concrete precise problem of internal politics the overall effect be probably to stimulate more party activity in the communal election than might have otherwise take place a second major point of this essay be to examine the formal arrangement for the election although a somewhat technical subject it have important political implication a the above discussion of the vote system indicate furthermore the problem and solution devise in the electoral experience of the rapidly change country be often of comparative value and essential to evaluate election result the sine qua non of the election be naturally an impartial and standardize procedure a the background discussion indicate there be frequently express doubt that a government dominate by either party could fairly administer election the pdi and late the popular movement protect the istiqlal s privilege position until the fall of balafrej and then the istiqlal use the same argument which it have previously ignore against the pro-unfp tendency of the ibrahim government the bulk of the preparation have of course proceed under the supervision of the ministry of the interior whose official be bar from party activity and probably generally disinterested in party politics apart from some area of recur trouble like bani mellal where inexperience official have be appoint there be little evidence that local official intervene in the electoral process centrally however the administrative problem be more complex and the sheer prestige of office be very likely an unfair advantage the king decide to remove ibrahim a week before election and to institute a non-party council of government under he personal direction although the monarch have frequently assert that the election be to be without party significance he action be an implicit admission that party identification be a factor the new council be itself inescapably of political mean which be most clearly reveal in the absence of any unfp member and the presence of several istiqlal leader since the detail of the election be settle the change of government have no direct effect on the technical aspect of the election and may have be more important a an indication of royal displeasure with the unfp vote preparation begin in the fall of 1959 although the actual demarcation and plan for the rural commune be complete in 1958 there be three major administrative task the fix of electoral district the registration of voter and the registration of candidate voter registration begin in late november 1959 and continue until early january 1960 the government be most anxious that there be a respectable response periodic bulletin of the accomplishment in each province make the registration process into a kind of competition among provincial official a goal be fix a give in table 2 and attention focus on it fulfillment the qualification to vote be keep very simple both man and woman of twenty-one year of age could register and vote upon present proof of residence and identification there be liberal provision for dispensation where document or record be lack the police be disqualify along with certain category of naturalize citizen criminal and those punish for protectorate activity the registration figure give in table 2 must be interpret with caution since the estimate for eligible elector be make without the benefit of a reliable census
