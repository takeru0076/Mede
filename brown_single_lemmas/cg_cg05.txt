it be a fortunate time in which to build for the seventeenth century be a great period in persian art the architect the tile and carpet maker the potter painter calligrapher and metalsmiths work through abbas s reign and those of he successor to enrich the city traveler enter from the desert be confound by what must have seem an illusion a great garden fill with nightingale and rose cut by canal and terrace promenade stud with water tank of turquoise tile in which be reflect the glisten blue curve of a hundred dome at the heart of all of this be the square which one such traveler declare to be a spacious a pleasant and aromatick a market a any in the universe in time isfahan come to be know a half the world isfahan nisf-i-jahan in the early eighteenth century this fantastic city then the size of london start to decline the afghan invade the safavid fall from power the capital go elsewhere the desert encroach isfahan become more of a legend than a place and now it be for many people simply a name to which they attach they notion of old persia and sometimes of the east they think of it a a kind of spooky museum in which they may half see and half imagine the old splendor those who actually get there find that it be nt spooky at all but a brilliant a a tile in sunlight but even for they it remain a museum or perhaps it would be more accurate to say a tomb a tomb in which persia lie well preserve but indeed dead everyone be ready to grant the persian they history but almost no one be will to acknowledge they present it seem that for persia and especially for this city there be only two time the glorious past and the corrupt depress sterile present the one apparent connection between the two be a score of building which somehow or other have survive and which naturally enough be call historical monument however just a all the building have not fall and flow back to they original mud so the value which want they and see that they be build have not all disappear the value and talent which make the tile and the dome the rug the poem and the miniature continue in certain social institution which rise above the ordinary life of this city a the great building rise above blank wall and dirty lane often too the social institution be house in these pavilion and palace and bridge for these great structure be not simply historical monument they be the place where persian live the promenade for example continue to take place on the chahar bagh a mile-long garden of plane and poplar tree that now serve a the city s principal street it take place a well along the terrace and through the arcade of the khaju bridge and also in the garden of the square on friday the day when many persian relax with poetry talk and a samovar people do not it be true stream into chehel sotun a pavilion and garden build by shah abbas 2 in the seventeenth century but they do retire into hundreds of pavilion throughout the city and up the river valley which be small more humble copy of the former and of course religious life continue to center in the more famous mosque and commercial life very much a social institution in the bazaar those three other great activity of the persian the bath the teahouse and the zur khaneh the latter a kind of club in which a leader and a group of man in an octagonal pit move through a rite of calisthenics dance chant poetry and music do not take place in building to which entrance ticket be sell but some of they occupy splendid example of persian domestic architecture long dome chalk-white room with daises of turquoise tile they end wall cut through to the orchard and the sky by open arch but more important and the thing which the casual traveler and the blind sojourner often do not see be that these place and activity be often the setting in which persian exercise they extraordinary aesthetic sensibility water air fruit poetry music the human form these thing be important to persian and they experience they with an intense and discriminate awareness i should like by the way to make it clear that i be not use the word persian carelessly i do nt mean a few aesthete who play about with sensation like a young prince in a miniature dabble he hand in a pool these thing be important to almost all persian and perhaps most important to the most ordinary the man cry love poem in an orchard on any summer s night be a often a not the lutihaw mustachioed tough who spend most of they life in and out of the local prison brothel and teahouse a few month ago it be a fairly typical landlord who in the dead of night lug i up a mountainside to drink from a spring famous in the neighborhood for it clarity and flavor not long ago an acquaintance a slick-headed water rat of a lad up from the maw of the city stand on the balcony puff he first cigarette in week the air he say be just right a cigarette would taste particularly good i really do nt know what he mean it be a nice day grant but he know he sniff the air and lick it on he lip and know a a vintner know a vintage the natural world then plus poetry and some kind of art receive from the most ordinary of persian a great deal of attention the line of an eyebrow the color of the skin a ghazal from hafiz the purity of spring water the long afternoon among the bough which crowd the upper story of a pavilion these thing be notice judge and value nowhere in isfahan be this rich aesthetic life of the persian show so well a during the promenade at the khaju bridge there have probably always be a bridge of some sort at the southeastern corner of the city for one thing there be a natural belt of rock across the river bed for another it be here that one of the old caravan route come in it be to provide a safe and spacious cross for these caravan and also to make a pleasance for the city that shah abbas 2 in about 1657 build of sun-baked brick tile and stone the present bridge it be a splendid structure from upstream it look like a long arcade box lay across the river from downstream where the water level be much low it be a high elaborately facaded pavilion the top story contain more than thirty alcove separate from each other by spandrel of blue and yellow tile at either end and in the center there be bay which contain nine great alcove a frescoed and capacious a church apse here in the old day when they have come to see the moon or display of firework sit the king and he court while priest soldier and other member of the party lounge in the small alcove between below twenty vault tunnel through the understructure of the bridge these be traverse by another line of vault and thus room arch on all four side be form down through the axis of the bridge there be a long diminish vista like a visual echo of pier and arch while the vault front upstream and down frame the sunset and sunrise the mountain and river pool here on the hot day it be cool beneath the stone and fresh from the water flow in the sluice at the bottom of the vault on the downstream or pavilion side these vault give out onto terrace twice a wide a the bridge itself from the terrace eighteen in all broad flight of step descend into the water or onto still more terrace barely above the level of the river out of water brick and tile they have make far more than just a bridge on spring and summer evening people leave they shop and house and walk up through the lane of the city to the bridge it be a great spectacle the bridge itself rise up from the river light-flared and enormous like the outdoor set for an epic opera crowd press along the terrace down the step in and out of the arcade mass against it a though it be a fortress under siege all kind come to walk in the promenade merchant from the bazaar bicker over a deal a bakhtiari khan in a cap and hack jacket dervish who stand with the stillness of the blind they eye film with rheum and vision the old kajar prince arrive in they ancient limousine student civil servant beggar musician hawker and clown family go out to the edge of the terrace to sit on carpet around a samovar below people line the step a though on bleacher to watch the sky and river above in the tile prosceniums of the alcove boy sing the ghazal of hafiz and saadi while at the very bottom in the vault the tough and blade of the city hoot and bang they drum drink arak play dice and dance here in an even persian enjoy many of the thing which be important to they poetry water the moon a beautiful face to a strange they delight in these thing may seem paradoxical for persian chase the golden calf a much a any people many of they moreover be begin to complain about the scarcity of western amusement and to ridicule the old life of the bazaar merchant the mullah and the peasant nonetheless they take time out much time from the game of grab and these new western experiment to go to the garden and riverbank above all they will stop in the middle of anything anywhere to hear or quote some poetry poetry in persian life be far more than a common ground on which in a society deeply fissured by antagonism all may stand it contain in fact they whole outlook on life and it be express at least to they taste in a perfect form poetry for a persian be nothing less than truth and beauty in most western culture today these twin have be send away to the library and museum in persia where practically speak there be no museum or library or for that matter hardly any book the twin run free it be perhaps difficult to conceive but imagine that tonight on london bridge the teddy boy of the east end will gather to sing marlowe herrick shakespeare and perhaps some lyric of they own that at any rate be what happen at the khaju bridge boy and man go along the riverbank or to the alcove in the top arcade here in these little room or stage arch open to the sky and river they choose a few line out of the hundreds they may know and sing they accord to one of the mode into which persian music be divide each mode be believe to have a specific attribute one induce pleasure another generosity another love and so on to include all of the emotion the singer simply match the poem to a mode for example the mode of bravery to this anonymous folk poem they bring i news that spring be in the plain and ahmad s blood the crimson tulip stain go tell he age mother that she son fight with a thousand foe and he be one or the mode of love to this fragment by a recent poet know you fair folk who dwell on earth or shall hereafter come to birth that here with dust upon he eye iraj the sweet-tongued singer lie in this true lover s tomb inter a world of love lie sepulchred these song practically all persian music for that matter be limit to a range of two octave yet within this limitation there be an astonish variety design a intricate a that in the carpet or miniature with the melodic line like the paint or weave line often flow into an arabesque
