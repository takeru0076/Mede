farm be confine the farmer s life must be arrange to meet the demand of crop and livestock livestock must be tend every day routinely a slight change in the work schedule may cut the production of cow or chicken even if there be no livestock the farmer can not leave the farm for long period particularly during the grow season the worker who life on a farm can not change job readily he can not leave the farm to take work in another locality on short notice such a move may mean a loss of capital hard physical labor and undesirable hour be a part of life the farmer must get up early and at time work late at night frequently he must work long hour in the hot sun or cold rain no matter how well work be plan bad weather or unexpect setback can cause extra work that must be catch up it may not be profitable for a part-time farmer to own the labor-saving machinery that a full-time farmer can invest in profitably production may fall far below expectation drought hail disease and insect take they toll of crop sickness or loss of some of the livestock may cut into the owner s earnings even into he capital return for money and labor invest may be small even in a good year the high cost of land supply and labor make it difficult to farm profitably on a part-time basis land within commute distance of a grow city be usually high in price high if it have subdivision possibility part-time farmer generally must pay high price for supply than full-time farmer because they buy in small quantity if the farm be in an industrial area where wage be high farm labor cost will also be high a part-time farmer need unusual skill to get a high production per hen per cow or per acre a can be obtain by a competent full-time farmer it will frequently be uneconomical for he to own the most up-to-date equipment he may have to depend upon custom service for specialize operation such a spray or threshing and for these he may have to wait he turn there will be loss cause by emergency that arise while he be away at he off-farm job the farm may be an additional burden if the main job be lose this may be true whether the farm be own or rent if the farm be rent the rent must be pay if it be own tax must be pay and if the place be not free of mortgage there will be interest and payment on the principal to take care of advantage a farm provide a wholesome and healthful environment for child it give they room to play and plenty of fresh air the child can do chore adapt to they age and ability care for a calf a pig or some chicken develop in child a sense of responsibility for work part-time farm give a measure of security if the regular job be lose provide the farm be own free of debt and furnish enough income to meet fix expense and minimum live cost for some retire person part-time farm be a good way to supplement retirement income it be particularly suitable for those who need to work or exercise out of door for they health generally the same level of live cost less in the country than in the city the saving be not a great however a be sometime suppose usually the cost of food and shelter will be somewhat less on the farm and the cost of transportation and utility somewhat more where school fire and police protection and similar municipal service be of equal quality in city and country real estate tax be usually about the same a part-time farmer and he family can use they spare time profitably some person consider the work on a farm recreational for some white-collar worker it be a welcome change from the regular job and a physical conditioner land labor and equipment need part-time farm can take comparatively little land labor and equipment or a great deal it depend on the kind and the scale of the farm operation general requirement for land labor and equipment be discuss below specific requirement for each of various type of enterprise be discuss on page 8 to 14 land three quarter to 1 acre of good land be enough for raise fruit and vegetable for home use and for a small flock of chicken a cow and two pig you could not of course raise feed for the livestock on a plot this small if you want to raise feed or carry out some enterprise on a large scale you ll need more land in decide how much land you want take into account the amount you ll need to bring in the income you expect but consider also how much you and you family can keep up along with you other work the cost of land and the prospect for appreciation in value may influence you decision some part-time farmer buy more land than they need in anticipation of suburban development this be a highly speculative venture sometimes a desire acreage be offer only a part of a large tract when surplus land be not expensive to buy or to keep up it be usually good to buy it than to buy so small an acreage that the development of adjoin property might impair the residential value of the farm labor if you have a year-round full-time job you can nt expect to grow much more than you family use unless other member of the family do a good deal of the work or you hire help a a rule part-time farmer hire little help in decide on the enterprise to be manage by family labor compare the amount of labor that can be supply by the family with the labor need of various enterprise list in table 1 list the number of hour the family can be expect to work each month you may want to include you own regular vacation period if you have one do not include all you spare time or all you family s spare time only what you be will to use for farm work equipment if you be go to produce for home use only you will need only hand tool you will probably want to hire someone to do the plow however for large planting you ll need some kind of power for plow harrow disking and cultivate if you have a plant of half an acre or more you may want to buy a small garden tractor available for $ 300 to $ 500 with attachment 1960 price these tractor be not entirely satisfactory for plow particularly on heavy soil so you may still want to hire someone to do the plow cost of power and machinery be often a serious problem to the small-scale farmer if you be go to farm for extra cash income on a part-time basis you must keep in mind the need machinery investment when you choose among farm enterprise you can keep you machinery investment down by buy good secondhand machinery by share the cost and upkeep of machinery with a neighbor and by hire someone with machinery to do certain job if an expensive and specialize piece of machinery be need such a a spray rig a combine or a binder it be good to pay someone with a machine to do the work select a farm before you look for a farm you ll need to know 1 the kind and scale of farm you want to undertake and 2 whether you want to buy or rent information on page 8 to 14 may help you in decide on the kind and scale of you farm venture if you be not well acquaint with the area in which you wish to locate or if you be not sure that you and you family will like and make a success of farm usually you would do good to rent a place for a year or two before you buy discuss below be some of the main thing to look for when you select a part-time farm location nearness to work choose a location within easy commute distance of both the regular job and other employment opportunity then if you change job you will nt necessarily have to sell the farm the presence of alternative job opportunity also will make the place easy to sell if that should become desirable obviously the farm should be on an all-weather road nearness to market if you grow anything to sell you will need market nearby if you plan to sell fresh vegetable or whole milk for example you should be close to a town or city kind of neighborhood look for a farm in a neighborhood of well-kept home there be slum in the country a well a in the city few rural area be protect by zoning a tavern fill station junk yard render plant or some other business may go up near enough to hurt you home or to hurt it value facility in the area check on the school in the area the quality of teach and the provision for transportation to and from they find out whether fire protection sewage system gas water mains and electrical line be available in the locality if these facility be not at the door get they may cost more than you expect you may have to provide they yourself or get along without they you can not get along without an adequate supply of pure water if you be consider a part-time farm where the water must be provide by a well find out if there be a good well on the farm or the probable cost of have one drill a pond may provide adequate water for livestock and garden pond water can be filter for human use but most part-time farmer would not want to go to so much trouble the follow amount of water be need per day for livestock and domestic use topography and soil be the land suit to the crop you intend to raise if you can nt tell get help from you county agricultural agent or other local specialist soil type drainage or degree of slope can make the difference between good crop and poor one small area that be nt right for a certain crop may lie next to area that be well suit to that crop the house will the house on any part-time farm you be consider make a satisfactory full-time residence how much will it cost to do any necessary modernize and redecorate if the house be not wire adequately for electricity or if plumbing or a central heat system must be install check into the cost of make these improvement buy a farm the value of the farm to you will depend on it worth a a place to live the value of the product you can raise on it the possibility of sell the property late on for suburban subdivision decide first what the place be worth to you and you family a a home in comparison with what it would cost to live in town take into account the difference in city and county tax insurance rate utility rate and the cost of travel to work next estimate the value of possible earnings of the farm to do this set up a plan on paper for operate the farm list the kind and quantity of thing the farm can be expect to produce in an average year estimate the value of the produce at normal price the total be the probably gross income from farm to find estimate net farm income subtract estimate annual farm expenditure from probable gross income from farm include a expenditure an allowance for depreciation of farm building and equipment also count a an expense a charge for the labor to be contribute by the family it may be hard to decide what this labor be worth but charge something for it otherwise you may pay too much for the farm and get nothing for you labor to figure the value of the farm in term of investment income divide the estimate annual net farm income by the percentage that you could expect to get in interest if the money be invest in some other way
