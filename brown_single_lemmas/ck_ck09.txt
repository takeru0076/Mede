it be the first time any of we have laugh since the morning begin the rider from concord be a good a he word he come spur and whoop down the road he horse kick up cloud of dust shout they re a-coming by god they re a-coming they be we hear he before he ever show and we hear he yell after he be out of sight solomon chandler have nt misjudge the strength of he lung not at all i think you could have hear he a mile away and he be burst at every seam with importance i have observe that be up on a horse change the whole character of a man and when a very small man be up on a saddle he d like a not prefer to eat he meal there that s understandable and i appreciate the sentiment a for this rider i never see he before or afterwards and never see he dismount so whether he stand tall or short in he shoe i can nt say but i do know that he give the day tone and distinction the last thing in the world that resemble a war be we line of farmer and storekeeper and mechanic perch on top of a stone wall and this dash rider make we feel a good deal sharpe and more alert to the situation we come down off the wall a if he have topple all of we and we crouch behind it i have hear people talk with contempt about the british regular but that only prove that a lot of people talk about thing of which they be deplorably ignorant whatever we feel about the redcoat we respect they in term of they trade which be kill and i know that i myself be nauseate with apprehension and fear and that i hand be soak wet where they hold i gun i want to wipe i flint but i do nt dare to the state i hand be in just a i do nt dare to do anything about the prime the gun would fire or not just a chance will i put a lot more trust in i two leg than in the gun because the most important thing i have learn about war be that you could run away and survive to talk about it the gunfire which be so near that it seem just a piece up the road now stop for long enough to count to twenty and in that brief interval a redcoat officer come tear down the road whip he horse fit to kill i do nt know whether he be after we rider who have go by a minute before or whether he be simply scout condition but when he pass we by a musket roar and he rear he horse swing it around and begin to whip it back in the direction from which he have come he be a fine and showy rider but he skill be waste on we from above i and somewhere behind i a rifle crack the redcoat officer collapse like a puncture bolster and the horse rear and throw he from the saddle except that one boot foot catch in the stirrup half crazed by the weight drag the dust and the heat the horse leap we wall dash out the rider s brain against it and leave he lie there among we while the horse crash away through the brush it be i initiation to war and the insane symphony war play for what have happen on the common be only terror and flight but this grin break head not ten foot away from i be the sharp definition of what i reality have become and now the redcoat be come and the gunfire be a part of the dust cloud on the road to the west of we i must state that the fast thing happen the slow they happen the passage and rhythm of time change and when i remember back to what happen then each event be a separate and freeze incident in i recollection there be a long interval between the death of the officer and the appearance of the first of the retreat redcoat and in that interval the dust cloud over the road seem to hover indefinitely yet it could not have be more than a matter of second and then the front of the british army come into view it be only hour since i have last see they but they have change and i have change in the very front rank two man be wound and stagger along trail blood behind they no drummer here no piper and the red coat be cover with a fine film of dust they march with bayonet fix and a fix on they face be anger fear and torment rank after rank of they come down the road and the face be all the same and they walk in a sea of dust committeeman hold you fire hold you fire a voice call and what make it even more terrible and unreal be that the redcoat rank never pause for an instant only some of they glance toward the stone wall from behind which the voice come the front of they column have already pass we when another officer come ride down the side of the road not five pace from where we be i cousin simmons carry a musket but he have load it with bird shoot and a the officer come opposite he he rise up behind the wall and fire one moment there be a man in the saddle the next a headless horror on a horse that bolt through the redcoat rank and during the next second or two we all of we fire into the suddenly disorganize column of soldier one moment the road be fill with discipline troop march four by four with a purpose a implacable a death the next a cloud of gun smoke cover a scream fury of sound out of which the redcoat soldier emerge with they bayonet and they curse fury in the course of this they have fire on we but i have no memory of that i have squeeze the trigger of i own gun and to i amazement it have fire and kick back into i shoulder with the force of an angry mule and then i be add i own voice to the crescendo of sound hurl more vile language than i ever think i know sob and shout and aware that if i have pass water before it be not enough for i pants be soak wet i would have stand there and die there if leave to myself but cousin simmons grab i arm in he viselike grip and fairly pluck i out of there and then i come to some sanity and plunge away with such extraordinary speed that i outdistance cousin simmons by far everyone else be run late we realize that the redcoat have stop they charge at the wall they only hope of survival be to hold to the road and keep march we tumble to a stop in deacon gordon s cow hole a low-lying bit of pasture with a muddy pool of water in it middle a dozen cow mooed sadly and regard we a if we be insane a perhaps we be at that moment with the crazy excitement of we first encounter the yell and shoot still continue up at the road and the thirst of some of the man which be so great that they wade into the muddy water and scoop up handful of it isaac pitt one of the man from lincoln have take a musket ball in he belly and though he have find the strength to run with we now he collapse and lie on the ground die the reverend hold he head and wipe he hot brow it may appear that we be cruel and callous but no one have time to spend sympathize with poor isaac except the reverend i know that i myself feel that it be a mortal shame for a man to be tear open by a british musket ball a isaac have be yet i also feel relieve and lucky that it have be he and not myself i be drink with excitement and the smell of gunpowder that come float down from the road and the fact that i be not afraid now but only wait to know what to do next meanwhile i reload i gun a the other man be do we be less than a quarter of a mile from the road and we could trace it shape from the ribbon of powder smoke and dust that hang over it wherever you look you see committeeman run across the meadow some away from the road some toward it some parallel to it and about a mile to the west a cluster of at least fifty militia be make they way in we direction cousin joshua and some other feel that we should march toward lexington and take up new position ahead of the slow-moving british column but another group maintain that we should stick to this spot and this section of road i do nt offer any advice but i certainly do not want to go back to where the officer lie with he brain dash out someone say that while we be stand here and argue about it the british would be go but cousin simmons say he have watch they march west early in the morning and move at a much brisk pace it have still take half an hour for they column to pass what with the narrowness of the road and they baggage and ammunition cart while this be be discuss we see the militia to the west of we fan out and break into little cluster of two and three man a they approach the road it be the opinion of some of we that these must be part of the committeeman who have be in the battle of the north bridge which entitle they to a sort of veteran status and we feel that if they employ this tactic it be likely enough the good one mattathias dover say it make sense if we cluster together the redcoat can make an advantage out of it but there s not a bless thing they can do with two or three of we except chase we and we can outrun they that settle it and we break into party of two and three cousin joshua dover decide to remain with the reverend and poor isaac pitt until life pass away and he be hurt so badly he do not seem for long in this world i go off with cousin simmons who maintain that if he do nt see to i he do nt know who would good heaven adam he say i think one thing you d have no trouble learn be when to get out of a place i learn that now i say we run east for about half a mile before we turn back to the road pant from the effort and soak with sweat there be a clump of tree that appear to provide cover right up to the road and the shout and gunfire never slacken under the tree there be a dead redcoat a young boy with a pasty white skin and a face full of pimple who have take a rifle ball directly between the eye three man be around he they have strip he of he musket and equipment and now they be pull he boot and jacket off cousin simmons grab one of they by the shoulder and fling he away god s name what be you to rob the dead with the fight go on cousin simmons roar they try to outface he but joseph simmons be a wide a two average man and it would have take brave man than these be to outface he
