hotei be 23 foot long with an 8-12-foot beam and every inch a family boat menfolk can ride in the forward cockpit where the helmsman have a clear view youngster can sleep or amuse themselves safely in the large cabin which have 5-foot 11-inch headroom bunk for three galley and marine toilet the gal can sun themselves in the roomy aft cockpit all be well distribute not crowd together near the stern and with passenger weight shift forward hotei level off for speed under power of a merc 800 the 80-hp motor drive she at 25 mph with six aboard with only two aboard hotei do good than 27 mph and she give a comfortable ride at this speed even in a three-foot chop she also bank into a turn like a fine runabout not dig in on the outside to throw passenger all over the boat like many a small cabin cruiser nor be she a wet boat we ve be out in five-foot wave and stay dry a lot of think go into storage space construction there s a large compartment in the forward cockpit for chart and other item the cabin have several shelf for small item and storage under the bunk for water skiis life jacket etc the aft cockpit have a afj storage bin over six foot long that double a a seat on each side of the motor well there s storage for battery bumper line and spare prop with six-gallon gas tank below the well itself be design to take two merc 800 s or 500 s if you wish and there s room for a 25-gallon long-cruise gas tank below it needless to say you can nt build hotei in a couple of week we build time be slightly over 400 hour but the total cost for the hull with fiberglas bottom sink head and hardware be under $ 800 a comparable manufacture boat would cost close to $ 3000 consider what you have to earn to be able to spend the $ 3000 and you build time be well worth it a gator trailer model 565 be use to transport the boat to the waterway this piece of equipment cost a little over $ 600 but it will save you that in moor and haul fee in a few year all frame in hotei be one-inch mahogany which in the dress state you buy it be about the 1316-inch thickness specify in the drawing therefore the lumber be buy in plank and rip to size for batten etc on a table see besides flathead bronze screw silicon bronze stronghold nail make by independent nail & pack co bridgewater mass be use extensively in assembly and weldwood resorcinol glue be use in all the joint construction follow a thorough study of the drawing start by lay out the six frame and the transom on a level floor draw each outline in a different-color chalk one on top of the other in this way you will be able to detect any obvious mistake the transom frame be make first with the joint lap glue and fasten with one-inch no 12 stronghold nail after notch it for the keelson chine and batten the half-inch plywood transom be secure to it with glue and the same type nail all frame be but at the joint and 38-inch plywood gusset be glue and nail on each side of each joint again use the one-inch no 12 nail the frame be notch only for the keelson and the chine if notch for the batten they would require more work be weaken and limber hole would have to be bore so that bilge water could flow through nowhere in the boat do the frame come in contact with the plywood planking the jig be erect after the frame and transom be complete this be an important step because any misalignment would cause progressively bad misalignment in the hull a you advance in construction be sure all member be parallel vertical and level a require after the frame and transom be set up on the jig and temporarily brace a piece of three-inch-wide mahogany only width will be give since the 1316-inch thickness be use throughout be but between frame one and two below the line of the keelson the frame be glue and screw to this piece the joint be also reinforce on each side with small block set in resin-saturated fiberglas cloth and nail it be over this piece that the laminate stem and keelson be splice the keelson make of two three-inch width be next install the first piece be glue and screw to the frame and transom and the piece but between frame one and two the second piece be in turn glue and screw to the first note however that it be six inch short at the forward end one-inch no 10 screw be use in both case a stem jig be next cut to the proper shape and temporarily fasten to frame one the stem be laminate from four piece take two three-inch-wide piece and rip they down the center of the thickness to make the four then spread a generous amount of glue on the four piece and bend they into place on the jig the first two piece butt against the inner member of the keelson and be glue and screw to the brace between the first two frame the second two piece lap over the inner member of the keelson and butt against the outer member they re glue and screw to the inner member of the keelson a number of c clamp hold the piece together on the jig until the glue set all bottom batten be two inch wide the side one be a half-inch narrow the batten be carefully fasten in place after some necessary fair on all frame glue and 1-12-inch no 10 screw be use placement be important because the rear seat bunk and front jump seat rest on or be fasten to many of the side batten with the exception of two batten all run to the stem where they be glue and screw after careful beveling the chine go in the same way except that they be make of two piece of two-inch wood for strength and easy bend fair be always a tedious job but the work can be cut down considerably with a skill plane and a simple jig i clamp a 30-inch piece of aluminum to the base of the plane with a pair of sure grip the aluminum flush against the batten act a a fair stick and enable i to plane the chine and keelson to the proper bevel easily if you do nt own a plane and do nt want to buy one it s well worth rent the planking be five-ply 38-inch-thick weldwood royal marine plywood this can be obtain in 42-inch width 24 foot long the 42-inch width leave very little waste four piece be use plank the side first use glue and one-inch no 12 stronghold nail at all batten the stem and the transom another person inside with a weight against each batten will help in the fasten the good procedure be to have a few friend hold the planking in place while you mark it off then trim the excess i use a homemaster routo-jig make by porter cable for this job it s good for cut all the planking because it cut with a bit-like blade at high rpm and do not chatter the plywood like a saber see when cut the planking be clamp in place for a final and careful trim then it be mark on the inside where it come in contact with the transom frame keelson and all the batten it may then be pre-drilled for the fastening the next step be to remove it and spread glue where it have be mark at the contact point then it be replace and fasten the bottom planking be apply in the same manner after planking the bottom get a layer of fiberglas the spray rail be first glue on the outside and fasten from the inside with screw then the chine be round off and the bottom be rough-sanded in preparation since the side be also cover up to the spray rail they be also rough-sanded in that area the cloth be lay on one half of the bottom at a time a 50-inch width be use on each side and it lap the keel line by about three inch lie the cloth in place and trim it to size then remove it and give the whole bottom a coat of resin when the resin have harden mix up another batch with a pigment add if you wish i use bright red mix the pigment in thoroughly before add the hardener use a cheap brush coat one side of the bottom with the resin and then apply the cloth when the cloth be smooth apply another coat of resin spread it with a paint roller be sure it be well saturate and then allow it to harden when the whole bottom have harden use a disk sander to feather the edge of the cloth at the keel line and near the spray rail then lie a three-inch-wide strip of cloth along the keel line from the transom to the point of the stem before the resin have harden screw a one-inch mahogany keel strip along the centerline this protect the bottom in beach fiberglas material be available from glass plastic supply co 1605 w elizabeth ave linden n j they will also supply literature on application the hull be now turn over with the help of about seven friend and place in a level well-braced position i set it on the gator trailer i lay three layer of glass cloth on the inside of the stem also install a bow eye at this time for add strength i also fasten a small block on each side of every frame and batten joint again these block be set in resin-saturated glass cloth and nail after trim off the excess on the frame and transom which be use to fasten they to the jig at a work height the top of the side planking be install this be make up of scrap leave over from the side and bottom these flare part really help to keep the boat dry when they re on the top edge be plane even with the sheer batten the side of the motor well run from the bottom batten to the top and from frame six to the transom form a real strong transom brace note another piece of wood six inch wide be fasten to the transom between these piece the deck be quarter-inch mahogany marine plywood all the floor and the storage bin be half-inch exterior fir plywood most floor batten be glue and screw to the floor the exception be where the floor butt these batten be glue and screw to the frame with all deck batten in place the bilge be clean and paint up to the floor line use one coat of firzite and one coat of marine paint bottom of the floorboard be also paint and the floor be then screw in place after the deck be on the cabin side be install they re follow by the front and rear bulkhead a illustrate the windshield glass be shatterproof and plexiglas be use in the cabin inside bunk be frame up and install a indicate a head be a handy thing to have and i install one under a removable section of the port bunk the sink in the hinge panel above the bunk drain into the head and a five-gallon water tank be mount on the bulkhead above the sink for pad the seat and bunk i use ensolite type afj lightweight non-absorbent fire resistant and dimensionally stable it be easily bond to the wood with contact cement available in afj sheet it cost about a dollar a square foot
