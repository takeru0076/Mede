he put in a call to cunningham from he hotel room the maid answer and he decide nancy must be at work jeb caution he not to be too hopeful and then ignore he own advice say excitedly but it do sound good a woman name lisa who tell nobody anything about herself that courtyard picture with the same initial i m not exactly jump up and down with enthusiasm i ll call you in a day or so on the highway he relax and enjoy the drive over lake pontchartrain and along the coast gulf spring be ten mile inland more of a quaint old coast town than those along the beach make garish by tourist attraction he check into a motel and drive downtown the courthouse be a white-stucco build minus the customary dome instead of the usual straggle privet hedge and patch of bare dirt in most small-town square the build be hem in by a semitropical growth of camellia and azalea and a smooth lawn the improbably bright-green shade of florist s grass he figure he good bet be a call on the sheriff a clerk in the outer office take he in to sheriff carruthers a big paunchy man with thick white hair and a voice with a senatorial resonance which suggest he should be run for high office seat in front of the desk hank say i m look for some information with very little to go on sheriff he explain the background of the case end with the tenuous clue which have bring he to gulf spring the sheriff s swivel chair tilt back so you re look for a woman who marry a man who might have live here a year ago and might have be poison if there be such a person i m afraid she get away with it pity we do nt know more about he i think the good bet be to go through the society column of last year and see if any of the groom match with the obituary a little late it ll be a tedious job but if you want to try it the old newspaper file be in the basement here in the county supervisor s office maybe the society editor would remember a good-looking out-of-town bride that s an idea mrs calhoun have be society editor here for twenty-five year the editor say that marriage may be make in heaven but wedding be make in mrs calhoun s column she s the one who decide which wedding be to get the lead space in the sunday paper and all that he smile once when the editor be just out of the hospital from a gallstone operation mrs calhoun and the mother of the bride go out to he house and fight it out beside he bed she d be sure to remember any bride who be vague about background she d have make a great scientist dedicate to track down heredity and environment she d also remember if the groom die late he stand up i wish you good luck but please do nt dig up too tough a case for i this close to election if you find out anything come on back here and we ll get start on it track down mrs calhoun be like try to catch up with paul revere between lexington and concord it turn out that she also sell real estate cosmetic and hospital insurance the weary trek stretch into the afternoon from newspaper plant to insurance office to she house and back to the newspaper where he find she at five oclock she be a large woman with a frizzle gray poodle cut and a pencil clamp like a bit between she tooth while she hunt and peck on an old typewriter it take a couple of minute to run through she various business and get down to the one he want last year well i do remember one from baton rouge marry a man name vincent black i remember she because she do nt want she picture in the paper first bride like that i ve see in twenty-five year what reason do she give say she have a breaking-out on she face some sort of allergy and none of she old picture be good enough i do nt see she till several day late at the wedding and she face look like it have never have a blemish on it but of course you could nt see too well through the veil be she name lisa carmody now how in hell would i remember that never mind i can look it up do they still live here i think they move away shortly after they be marry he be a salesman for something or other and must have be transfer i m sure it ll be in the file we usually run a social note when somebody move away he stand up and thank she have they inherit some money or something she ask with a reportorial gleam in she eye he say vaguely well it be a little legal matter but nothing like that he hurry across to the courthouse and catch the sheriff just a he be leave sound like what you re after he say when hank have finish come on let s hurry down before they lock up for the day in the basement the sheriff take he to a small dingy office occupy by a tall thin man informal in rolled-up shirt sleeve mr ferrell hirey lindsay chairman of the board of supervisor mr ferrell be a private detective hirey want to look up something in the newspaper file so do nt lock he in here sure say hirey i ll just leave the door open it latch when you close it so stay a long a you like carruthers cross the room to a metal door with an open grillework in the top half he pull it open now do nt shut this door it will nt open from inside before we build the new jail we use to keep prisoner in here overnight sometimes when the old jail get too crowd hirey treat himself a lot good than we do prisoner they be a sight more comfortable than the one in the jail with the cold air from hirey s air conditioner come through the grille he walk past the sheriff into a windowless room with shelf full of big leather-bound volume from floor to ceiling all around the wall a metal table and four chair stand in the center they re all here back to 1865 carruthers tell he it s all right to smoke but make sure you cigarette be out before you leave and of course you know not to take clipping i ll leave the air conditioner on for you mr ferrell say hirey do nt forget to turn it off and close the door good so it ll latch hank thank they and promise to observe the rule when they have go he stand for a minute breathe in the mustiness of old paper and leather which the busily thrum air conditioner could nt quite dispel chapter fourteen in a tour around the stack he find that the early volume begin on the leave and progress clockwise around the room an old weakness for burrow in record rise up to tempt he it be indeed all here almost a century from reconstruction to moon rocket but he pull away from the irrelevant old volume and walk around to the new one last year s volume be at the top a couple of inch below the ceiling near it be a metal ladder on caster attach to the top shelf he pull it over climb up and lift out the big volume almost lose he balance from the weight of it he stagger over and drop it on the table since mrs calhoun remember only that the marriage have be in the spring he start to plod through several month he try to turn right to the society page in each one but interest story keep crop up to distract he at last he find it in the paper of april 2 it tell he little more than mrs calhoun have remember state that it have be a small modest wedding compare to some of the other there be a mark contrast in the amount of information on bride and groom mr black s life be an open book so to speak from he birth in jackson mississippi through he basketball-playing day at lsu and he attainment of a ba degree which have presumably prepare he for he career a district sales manager for peerless business machine the one line on the bride say she be miss lisa carmody from baton rouge no mention of new orleans hank be begin to feel sharp concern for mr black if mrs black be who he think she be mr black s peerless sell day might well be over now for they exodus from gulf spring this time the search take twice a long cut down on he extra read for he have to pick through several column of one - and two-line social note in each issue he find it in the edition of may 15 the item say mr and mrs black have move to jackson he home town so the lovely lisa have be with he a year ago next on he program be a call to the jackson office of peerless business machine to find out if vincent black be still with they or more specifically still with we he glance at he watch see it be only seven and decide to indulge he weakness now for the next hour he scramble happily up and down the ladder share the excitement of reporter who have see mckinley s assassination the iroquois theater fire in chicago and the hall-mills trial in the middle of the stock market crash he hear a slight noise in the outer office he turn around see nothing and decide it must be a mouse something else distract he yet there be no sound only tomblike silence then he know it be not sound but lack of it the air conditioner be no long run he jump up and turn around to see the metal door close it clanged shut a he spring toward it he press he face against the grille who s there the light shine through the grille dimly illumine the office beyond enough for he to see there be no one there then he hear the outer door close hey come back he shout he think it must be some damn janitor or clean woman putter around figure that hirey have go off and forget to turn off everything and lock up then the faint beginning of fear stir in he mind unless he be stone-blind the person who d just leave could nt have miss see hank through the open door of the brightly light room and even if he d somehow miss see he he would nt have go off and leave the light on and door open in the file room whoever it be have mean to shut he up in here have follow he and wait till the courthouse and square be desert but why to search he room at the motel to come back late and kill he after the store have close around the square and everybody have leave no they could kill he just a easy right now nobody could hear what be go on in this underground vault then he hear it and smell it the steady hiss the dread familiar pungency of gas escape it must be come from an upright heater against the far wall in the supervisor office until now lilac gaylor and lila kingsley have be like an anagram which he could unscramble at he own pace and choose except for those minute in she room he have lose touch with she a a reality gaylor s obsession and cunningham s chimera-chasing reminiscence have mesmerize he into think of lila and lilac separately or together a a legend they keep drift apart and merge again in he mind like some minute form of life on a microscope slide
