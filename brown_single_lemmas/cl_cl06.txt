eight nine step above he robert have pause mickey pause with he wait no long impatient try now to think it out do a little plan he look down over the banister at the hotel desk with the telephone and pen set if i could call in they could check the story while we be on we way i would nt have to tell they i have robert then he hear it like a muffle thud feel a subtle change in air pressure he glance up in time to see robert hurtle down on he from above literally fly through the air he bloody face twist mickey try to flatten against the banister grip it with one hand but robert full weight strike he at that moment in the groin he gasp for air and the impact tear he hand from the rail he tumble with robert helpless and in agony over and over down the step by a wrench effort he manage to hunch and draw in to take the final fall on he back and shoulder rather than he head he be fuzzy in he mind and for a moment helpless on the lobby floor but he be conscious and free of the weight of robert body when he vision clear he see the tall one scramble upward reach mickey be on he knee when robert turn on the stairs and the razor flash in he hand he feel he empty pocket and know that robert have retrieve the only weapon at hand mickey s eye fix on the other s foot which would first betray the moment and direction of an attack he rise stiffly force he knee to lock the knifelike pain in he groin nearly bring he down again he make himself back off slowly he eye wary on robert who now have no more to lose than he the pain dull a he move and he steady inside after a moment he extend one hand the finger curl come on he say you want to be that big a fool i be hope for this robert brush at he eye with he free hand and start down the step he hold the razor well out to one side he be invulnerable to attack but he could be handle mickey know if he could be bring to make the first move they be eight foot apart when robert clear the last step mickey wait with slack arm any time robert he say or would it be easy if i put i hand in i pocket the taunt be lose on robert he advance slowly directly give no hint of a feint to either side he be just short of arm s reach when he stop mickey back off two step force he to come on again there be a fix grin on robert face make hideous by the swell nose and the smear blood mickey back off again and robert hesitate then come along they move in a series of rhythmic fit and start a macabre dance two step back two step forward two step back mickey feel he shoulder come up against the wall beside the heavy slab front door this be go to be it now any second and what he have to remember be to keep he eye on the razor no matter what even if robert should feint with a kick to the groin the deadly hand be he exclusive concern the kick come sudden and vicious but short mickey s guts twist with the effort but he keep he eye on the weapon it move in a silver arc toward he throat then veer downward he hunch he leave shoulder into it and slash at robert forearm with he own feel the blade slide off he sleeve before robert could move inside to cut upward toward he face he slam he right fist into robert belly robert sag and slash at he wildly duck mickey trip and fall to one side land heavily on the wood floor then robert be on he gasp for breath and for a couple of second mickey lose sight of the blade he feel it rip at the side of he jacket and a momentary sting under he leave rib he get a knee up into robert belly use both hand and heave he clear then scramble to he foot they be in the center of the lobby now still clutch the razor robert come up into a crouch shake he head when he charge mickey be ready he hit robert with he leave fist in the rib and the razor cut toward he feebly then wobble in mid-air with he right fist and nearly all he weight behind it he smash at the bloodstained face robert careen backward he back arch fight for balance and fail stumble against the newel post at the foot of the stairs the sound of he head strike the solid wood be an ultimate sudden-end sound he fall on he side across the low step roll over once then lie still mickey find himself lean against the desk with stiff hand pant for breath after a minute he go to robert look at one of he eye and feel for a pulse he could nt feel any robert appear to be dead if not yet then soon very soon suddenly it be cold in the lobby 12 it seem to he that a long time have pass before he decide what to do actually it be no more than eight or ten minute and the sum of he reason come to this there s no way to take he in now and keep those other two wister and the one who hire the two of they from find out about robert and lam out the local law here would hold i till they check clear back home and maybe more than that they would have to by then they could never catch up with the other there s no other way i ll have to do it myself he look at where robert lie sprawl on the step mickey be sure now he be dead one thing he think nobody know about it yet only i he climb the stairs go into robert room find a suitcase and pack a much into it a he could he leave a few thing it do nt have to be perfect robert be a wastrel walk away on impulse he might logically leave behind what it be inconvenient to carry when he have close the suitcase he find a rag and move about the room wipe carefully everything he might have touch it take he nearly an hour he go to the room he have rent and get into he overcoat he leave the rest of he thing and return to the lobby he set robert suitcase near the front door go outside and walk back to the garage he be mildly surprise to find it be snow it snow softly silently an undulating interruption of he vision against the night sky he could feel it on he face and in he hair he find the key to the jeep get it start and warm it up for five minute then he back out and swing around to the front drive he go into the hotel and search till he find the razor he put it in he own pocket for safekeeping he take the suitcase out to the jeep and put it in the front seat then he go back for robert the body be heavy than he have anticipate he get it onto he shoulder after some work and carry it outside and down to the jeep he dump it into the back and make sure it would nt roll out then return to the porch and close the front door make sure it be unlock he drive carefully in the direction of the brief tour they have take early it snow continuously but quietly evenly when he reach the dip in the wood he see that already the early rut be barely discernible the jeep fight it way through the low spot and get onto high ground he drive in low gear to the fork in the road and swing a close a possible to the entrance to the abandon i he park face it and leave the headlight on but when he start into the tunnel with the suitcase he find the illumination extend no far than half a dozen foot into the passage he go back and get the flashlight return to the tunnel and carry the suitcase to the edge of the pit he have find early he toss the bag into the pit and watch dry dust spray up around it when the dust settle he go back to the jeep and carefully work robert body onto he shoulder it be nt like carry the suitcase the soft snow be deceitful underfoot twice he nearly fall inside the passage he have to work he way over the fall timber and nearly collapse under he clumsy burden by the time he reach the edge of the pit he be pant and he shoulder and back ache under the drag of the dead weight he stand look down for a few second then back up two or three pace from the edge there be too much weight casually to toss it away he could feel himself fall in with it and be unable to get out it would be a bad place to die it be a bad place for robert to wind up but robert have ask for it it be too late to worry about that he kneel slowly and dump the corpse onto the floor of the tunnel it be a relief to get rid of the weight he be shake with tension and it take he a couple of minute to get he breath and settle down then he get on he knee and roll robert body toward the edge it hang momentarily on the point of drop off he give it a strong push hear it slide then tumble dryly into the hole he get to he foot and throw the flashlight beam into the pit the body lie in an awkward sprawl twelve or fifteen foot below the level of the tunnel floor deep enough he decide there be little chance anyone would enter this shaft during the winter the external sign of he approach to it would be cover by the snow probably by the next day it be nt cold enough in the tunnel to preserve the body intact by spring it would be a skeleton he make he way back to the jeep he have start to back into the turn when he remember the razor in he pocket he climb down go back into the tunnel and toss the razor into the pit it land on robert sprawl right thigh poise precariously then slide off to the ground he go back once more to the jeep and start the short drive to the hotel in the garage he check the jeep for sign of the use he have make of it there be stain here and there and he clean they off use an oil rag he find on a nail he wipe the steer wheel and all the place he might have touch the jeep he replace the flashlight where it have be stow get into he own car and back it out of the garage there be tire mark where it have be but they be overlap by other and on the dusty floor would not be noticeable except under close scrutiny liz peabody he think might spend some time grieve for she lose lover but he doubt that she would launch an investigation he judge she to be a woman of some pride though not much sense still she would probably have sense enough not to call in the local sheriff to find she boy friend who apparently have run away
