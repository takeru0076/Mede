mr podger always particularly enjoy the last night of each summer at loon lake the narrow fringe of sadness that run around it only emphasize the pleasure the even be not always spend in the same way this year on a night cool with the front of september move in but with plenty of summer still about the podger be hold a neighborhood gather in the pod the little cottage be burst with people of all age in the midst of it all mr podger come out on the pod porch alone he have that day attend a country auction and he have come back with a prize the prize be an old-fashioned weave cloth hammock complete with cross-top pillow fringe side piece and hook for hang mrs podger have obligingly push thing around on the porch to make room for it and there it be sling in a vine-shaded corner the night breeze ripple it fringe with a slow caress movement mr podger sit down in it push himself back and forth in one or two slow rhythmic motion and then swing he foot up into it he close he eye and let the unintelligible drift of voice sweep pleasantly over he suddenly one young voice rise above the other but it say do you always know when you re happy the voice sink back into the general tangle of sound but the question stay in mr podger s mind here in the cool autumn-touched even mr podger mentally retrace a day that have leave he greatly content and at peace it have begin with the blue jay feather walk along the lake before breakfast mr podger have see the feather and the bird that have lose it in flight the wing spread of blue have go on call harshly into the wood the small shaft of blue have drift down and come to rest at he foot all day long mr podger who be a straw-hat man in the summer have wear the feather in the band of he broad-brimmed sunshield would a blue feather in a man s hat make he happy all day hardly but it be something to have see it float down through the early morning sunshine link the blue of the sky with the blue of the aster by the lake then since the auction be be hold nearby he have walk to it and there on the way have be the box turtle that slow self-contained world-ignoring relic of pre-history bend for reason good know to itself on cross the road it be do very well too have reach the center and be pursue it way with commendable singleness of purpose when mr podger see hazard approach in the shape of a flashy little sport car would the driver see the turtle would he take pain to avoid it mr podger take no chance take off he hat and signale the driver with it mr podger step into the road lift the surprise turtle and consummate it road-crossing with what must have be a breath-taking suddenness the turtle immediately withdraw into it private council room to study the phenomenon but mr podger and the driver of the sport car wave at each other here in the cool darkness mr podger could still feel the warmth of midday could still see the yellow butterfly dance over the road could still see the friendly grin on the young sun-worded face a the driver look back over he shoulder for a moment before the car streak out of sight where be the driver now what be he do and the turtle mr podger smile for a few brief minute they have all be part of one little drama the three would never meet again but for some reason or other mr podger be sure he would always remember the incident then there have be the auction itself mr podger hear again at will the voice of the auctioneer the voice of the bidder and finally the small boy who have be so interest in mr podger s hammock purchase i like they thing too he have say we get one at home you know what if you re lyin out in the hammock at night and it get kinda cool you know you just take these side with the fringe on see and wrap em right over you i do it lot o time i like to lie in a hammock at night by myself when it s all quiet the wind move it a little bit you know mr podger have thank he gravely and now he make use of the advice a he pull the fringe side up and make himself into a cocoon mr podger see that thin attractive freckle little face again and hope that the boy too be lie in a cool fringed-wrapped quiet alacrity the podger cat come by the hammock rub she back briefly against it and then sure of a welcome hop up she remark that she find the night wind a little chilly and mr podger take she inside the fringe soon she pur rivaled the chirp of the tree cricket rivaled the hum of voice from inside the pod mr podger be just add this to he picture of the day when the screen door open and pam burst out dad she say it s get so chilly we ve light a fire and we re go to tell a round robin story a nice scary one we need you to start it why be you out here all by yourself be nt you happy mr podger open he cocoon and emerge tuck alacrity under he arm to bring she in by the fire of course i be he say never happy in i life i just come out here to know it dallas a the south begin another school year national and even world attention be direct at the region s slow progress toward racial equality in the public school desegregation be begin in two more important southern city dallas and atlanta in each city civic and education leader have be work hard to get public opinion prepare to accept the inevitability of equal treatment these program emphasize the acceptance of biracial classroom peacefully the program do not take side on the issue itself they point out simply that it be the law of the land the two city have the example of little rock and new orleans to hold up a warning against resort to violence to try to stop the process of desegregation even good they have the example of nashville and houston to hold up a peaceful and progressive program in each case there be an initial act of violence in nashville a school be dynamit in houston there be a few incident of friction between white and negroes none of which be serious in each city quick public reaction and fast action by the city government halt the threat of more serious incident the nashville plan incidentally have become recognize a perhaps the most acceptable and thus the most practical to put into effect in the trouble south it be a stair-step plan in which desegregation begin in the first grade each year another grade be add to the process until finally all 12 grade be integrate the schedule be flexible so that the program can be accelerate a the public become more tolerant or realize that it be something that have to be do so why not now the program have work well in both nashville and houston it meet a serious rebuff in new orleans where the two school select for the first move toward integration be boycott by white parent another attempt will be make this year in new orleans to resume the program generally throughout the south there be a grow impatience with the pattern of violence with which every step of desegregation be meet perhaps the most eloquent move toward removal of racial barrier have be in dallas during the summer negroes begin quietly patronize previously segregate restaurant and lunch counter in downtown retail establishment it be part of a citywide move toward full integration so successful have be this program work out by white and negro civic leader that far extension be expect in the next few month hotel for example be ready to let down the bar already at least one hotel have be quietly take reservation on a nonracial basis several convention have be hold in recent month in hotel on a nonsegregated basis this be a radical change in attitude from the condition which prevail several year ago when a series of bombing be direct against negroes who be move into previously all-white neighborhood of dallas it be also symptomatic of a change in attitude which appear to be spread all across the south southern white themselves be realize that they have be wrong in use violence to try to stop negroes from claim equal right they insist they be ashamed of such violence and intimidation a occur in alabama when the freedom rider seek to break down racial discrimination in local bus depot all across the south there be sign that racial violence be find less approval among white who themselves would never take active part but might once have show a tolerant attitude toward it there be many cause for this change one of the most important be economic business leader be aware now that they suffer greatly from any outbreak of violence they be put strong pressure on they police department to keep order in the past these same southerner be incline to look the other way and a the businessman have begin to act a real sense of co-operation have spring up this co-operation have embolden other southern white to add they voice to demand for peaceable accommodation they realize that by act in concert rather than individually they will not be pick out a object of retaliation economic and otherwise since move from a chicago suburb to southern california a few month ago i ve be introduce to a new game call lanesmanship play mostly on the freeway around los angeles it go like this a driver cruise easily at 70 mph in lane a of a four-lane freeway spy an incipient traffic jam ahead traffic in the next lane appear to be move more smoothly so he poke a tentative fender into lane b which be heavily populate by car also move at 70 mph the adjacent driver in lane b have three choice open to he he can 1 point he car resolutely at the invade fender and force the other driver back into lane a 2 slow down and permit the ambivalent driver to change lane or 3 alternately accelerate and decelerate thus keep the first driver guess a to he intention thereby make a fascinate sport of the whole affair the really remarkable thing to i be that most california native unhesitatingly elect to slow down and permit the invade car free access whether or not this be do out of enlighten self-preservation i do nt know but it be do consistently and i m both surprise and impress this could never happen in i native chicago there such soggy acquiesence would be look upon a a sure sign of deteriorate manhood in chicago the driver cut out would likely jam he gas pedal to the floor in an effort to force the other car back fail this he would pull alongside at the first opportunity and shake he fist threateningly this negative explanation of courtesy on the freeway however do an injustice to southern california driver at the risk of lose i charge-a-plate at marshall field and company i would like to challenge an old and hallowed stereotype after three month of research i can state unequivocally that los angeles driver be considerably more courteous and competent than any other driver i ve ever encounter during one recent day of drive about los angeles there be actually a dozen occasion when oncoming driver stop an entire lane of traffic to permit i to pull out of an impossible side street
