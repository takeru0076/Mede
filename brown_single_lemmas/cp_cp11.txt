fool i ve be she say quietly i know all this but i pay no attention i do nt even own the house i m stand in i be so sure it be all temporary that we would all embrace and then the lawyer would tear up all those thing it narrow down down down and finally there be no way out if i be not to be mrs salter i be nothing i suppose i should have pay attention to that half-murmured remark but it seem one of those extreme statement woman under stress indulge in i love you i hate you i feel like kill you and myself and in the same sequence i love you i think you re the most wonderful the most noble and so on and on meanwhile eat a good breakfast and dinner and enjoy live so i go about i business i make a lemon sponge a light dessert roast a chicken parboil some freeze vegetable so there would be something nice in the icebox for the weekend do nt bother ida she say i have these appointment in town for saturday and i ll probably spend sunday with dolly or the thaxters at last i think she s recover she spirit with this movie-to-be in london and new face about she there she would soon be a more tranquil a wise person all the good for she stay out here i feel more cheerful a if i have have a part in bring she through to a great tolerance of herself and i go back to i own cottage to live i own little patch of life it be foggy that even but the path to i house be so well groove that i could feel i way accustom a i be to the dense mist that rise from the sun-warmed palisade of the river and sometimes last for day in the morning the fog be still thick so that to go to the village i creep along with i headlight full on i do notice a twinkle of light from the big house through the wood but a i have leave a light on in i own house because of the fog i assume mrs salter have do the same before she leave for town i do i shop have i dentist appointment and from there i go to the woman s lunch at we parish church where we discuss plan for the annual christmas bazaar so that dusk be begin to gather when i drive home in the late afternoon but the next day sunday why when i drive down to church do nt it speak to i see the light still on and the day crisp and clear prisoner bring to the dock accuse of murder or accident say they can not remember and read the account of they testimony you can not believe that the mind can remove absent itself unsee when i come back from church at noon mrs thaxter be turn into the salter driveway even at a car s length i could sense that something be wrong and so i follow she up to the turnaround in front of the house dolly engisch be wait there on the step and she come run toward we she s nowhere nowhere she scream and both woman run up to the house and i follow the search begin in all the room run upstairs down open closet talk exclaim in rush and gasp everything be a i have leave it the night before last she portfolio and bag for town she lingerie and dress and shoe lay out only she mink coat be miss and she then the telephone begin i who until that day before have be mrs salter s friend she equal be the servant now it be dolly and mrs thaxter who be call via everybody and when they speak they speak to each other and not to i and after i bring they sandwich and coffee i have to go back to i place in the kitchen and wait sit in the kitchen i recall every word mrs salter say that could have be a sign to i if i be not to be mrs salter then i be nothing why do nt that alarm i then and when she return from take she guest back to new york she have say all they talk about be harvie harvie this harvie that when they know the truth will they drop away from i will i become a nothing and then i remember a few year before after they return from a short trip to rome i have hear she boast over and over again on the boat people like i for myself i have make a habit of call she at night from i cottage just to check the last night i have call but the line be always busy and it reassure i i assume it be one of those hour-long conversation with dolly or constance she comfortable in bed but it seem not from what they be say then be it a final desperate plea from she to whom hang on and on past any man s patience some final stab of conclusion she be find the day after at the bottom of the cliff i try to believe that what must have happen be that restless disturb by this telephone call or whatever she walk out in the night a she have a habit of do sometimes she take the path that wind up around i cottage to the walk at the edge of the cliff it s so romantic up there she use to say with the broad river gleam in it moontrack like an enormous dark mirror and all the sound of the night so poetic with all that warm rain and the fog it might have be a simple a a loosen rock a misstep but i do nt really think it be a simple a that nor do anyone else when a fisherman bring she up in he arm still small a if she be a child asleep i begin to shudder with a terrible excitement almost triumphant that i still can not account for be it a hysterical release from the long strain of vigilance of those week that at last the vigilance the will give way or what be it that before via sonny walter and all i begin almost to dance with shudder and cry out i know she d do it i know everyone stare at i and draw back they eye turn cold and accuse even via s and they have never change at the same time that i think i understand she at long last and pity she underneath this know have there burn unquenched by i pity a fire of hate an endure envy that burst out in that ghastly outcry be that what have give way in i even now i be appal at how little anyone know of what they really be it be absurd of course to say that that one exclamation estranged i from the family i consider i very own but there it hang a cool void that break we close connection with each other at the time i be fill with self-pity at this separation but in the year since i have come to understand that the sight of i be painful to they after that outcry in i person they would always remember that last long time of i alone with she so if they tell themselves that i could have prevent it i can understand that by now and love they still because everyone must justify have a scapegoat for what be not to be bear it be not they avoidance that rankle it be when i meet someone who be a close friend of the family and therefore of i and they nod to i so coolly and walk away that it hurt i could tell they but no one ever ask why i have cry out so triumphantly at the sight of she body no i forget mrs mathias who have be away visit a marry daughter when it happen she haunt i she persist in explain how and why she have advise mrs salter to return to the country we all feel guilty i turn away from she coldly it be nobody s fault she overplay she hand what do you mean she frown why put such a high value on be top dog i add it be coarse almost insult this harsh appraisal and she have never come to see i since but suppose she have not take mrs mathias advice and live on like thousands of woman in town dispossess of love hang on to makeshift and altogether and finally arid if she choose and in that final decision discard what above all all of we value life itself must she not have rise to she full height and transcend she murky self feel at last the passion of a great moral decision if they say i could have stop she it be because they be ignorant of she last week of self-examination she search into herself and it conclusion yes i have cry out that i know she d do it but without i fully realize it at the time it be a cry of triumph for she praise at she deliverance from pettiness and greed and guilt she be finally at rest in truth of she own proud free choice at rest with i darling ellen the first mrs salter mr salter come home the funeral service be in the house the methodist minister how clean and glisten he eyeglass and he neat body stand beside that coffin with that doll inside a strange speak to stranger the old sacred word and the rain drum incessantly in accompaniment seven day of relentless rain that turn the ground to mud so the burial have to be postpone i wait then via call to say they have decide to cremate she a they have ellen the think leap to i mind and do i want to meet she at the funeral home the next morning the coffin stand on trestle in a corner of the long low dimly light funeral parlor on it dark shine surface the sheaf of white rose i have order i kneel just for decency i think at the time but find myself whisper we father which art in heaven and it be only after that that something unlock in i and i feel a grief via be in the park lot when i go outside together we wait in she car until the hearse move out and we follow it down into the heavy traffic of new jersey by the time we arrive and enter the build sacred music be already swell out into the chapel-like auditorium with it discreet symbol of religious faith again i feel impel to kneel and reach back and pull via down something would come into she heart if nothing else the sound of bach would give she some healing
