every taxpayer be well aware of the vast size of we annual defense budget and most of we reader also realize that a large portion of these expenditure go for military electronics we have note how some electronic technique develop for the defense effort have evenutally be use in commerce and industry the host of novel application of electronics to medical problem be far more thril because of they implication in matter concern we health and vitality when we consider the electronic industry potential for human betterment the prospect be stagger the author have recently study the field of medical electronics and have be convince that in this area alone the application of electronic equipment have enormous possibility the benefit electronics can bring to bio-medicine may be great by far than any previous medical discovery we use the term bio-medicine because of the close interrelation between biology and medical research electronics have be apply to medicine for many year in the form of such familiar equipment a the x-ray machine the electrocardiograph and the diathermy machine recently many doctor have install ultrasonic vibration machine for deep massage of bruise contusion and simple bursitis commonly use electronic device which be find in practically every hospital be closed-circuit tv and audio system for internal page and instruction along with radiation counter timer and similar device in this article we will concentrate on the advance in the application of electronics in bio-medical research laboratory because this be where tomorrow s commonplace equipment originate from the wealth of material and the wide variety of different electronic technique perfect in the past few year we have select a few example which appear to be head for use in the immediate future and which offer completely new tool in medical research ultraviolet microscopy many cell bacterium and other microorganism be transparent to visible light and must be stain for microscopic investigation this stain often disrupt the normal cell activity or else color only the outside a completely new insight into live cell and they structure will be possible by use of a new technique which replace visible light with ultraviolet radiation and combine a microscope with a color-tv system to view the result fig 1 be a simplify block diagram of the ultraviolet microscopy system develop at the medical electronics center of rockefeller institute by combine the talent of a medical man dr aterman a biophysicist mr berkely and an electronics expert dr zworykin this novel technique have be develop which promise to open broad avenue to understand life process three different wavelength of ultraviolet radiation be select by the variable filter place in front of the three mercury xenon light which serve a the ultraviolet source these wavelength be reflect in sequence through the specimen by the rotate mirror the specimen be magnify by the microscope instead of the observer s eye the image orthicon in the tv camera do the look the microscope and orthicon be both select to operate well into the ultraviolet spectrum which mean that all lense must be quartz the video signal be amplify and then switch in synchronism with the three ultraviolet light source which be sequence by the rotate mirror so that during one-twentieth of a second only one wavelength correspond to red green or blue be see note because of light leakage from one ultraviolet source to another the light be switch by a commutator-like assembly rotate by a synchronous motor this assembly also supply a 20-cps switch gate for the electronics circuitry this be the same system a be use in the field-sequential color-tv system which precede the present simultaneous system three separate amplifier then drive a 21-inch tricolor tube the result be a color picture of the specimen where the primary color correspond to the three different ultraviolet wavelength many of the cell and microorganism which be transparent to visible light absorb or reflect the much short wavelength of the ultraviolet spectrum different part of these cell sometimes absorb or reflect different wavelength so that it be often possible to see internal portion of cell in a different color where the microscope under visible light may show only vague shadow or nothing at all ultraviolet illumination and subsequent translation into a color tv picture reveal a wealth of detail at the present time the research team which pioneer this new technique be primarily interest in advance and perfect it breathe electronically analyze the medical title of lobar ventilation in man by drs cj martin and ac young cover a brief paper which be one part of a much large effort to apply electronics to the study of the respiratory process at the university of washington medical school the electronics group have develop the respiratory gas analyzer show in fig 3 this unit affectionately dub the monster can be wheel to any convenient location and provide a wealth of information about the patient s breathe in the low center rack an 8-channel recorder indicate the percentage of carbon dioxide and nitrogen from the upper and low lobe of one lung the total volume of inhalation per breath the flow of air from both lobe and the pressure of the two lobe with respect to each other usually the patient breathe into a mouthpiece while walk a treadmill stand still or in some other medically significant position from the result data the doctor can determine lung defect with hitherto unknown accuracy and detail heart-measuring technique the original electrocardiograph primarily indicate irregularity in the heartbeat but today s technique allow exact measurement of the flow of blood through the aorta dimension of the heart and it chamber and a much more detail study of each heartbeat for many of these measurement the chest must be open but the blood vessel and the heart itself remain undisturbed a group of researcher at the university of washington have give a paper which briefly outline some of these technique one simple method of measure the expansion of the heart be to tie a thin rubber tube fill with mercury around the heart and record the change in resistance a the tube be stretch a balance resistance bridge and a pen recorder be all the electronic instrumentation need sonar can be use to measure the thickness of the heart by place small crystal transducer at opposite side of the heart or blood vessel and exciting one with some pulse ultrasonic energy the travel time of sound in tissue be about 1500 meter per second thus it take about 16 msec to traverse 25 mm of tissue a sonar or radar-type of pulse generator and time-delay measure system be require for body-tissue evaluation in addition to the heart and aorta successful measurement of liver and spleen have also be make by this technique the doppler effect use ultrasonic signal can be employ to measure the flow of blood without cut into the blood vessel a still more sophisticate system have be devise for determine the effective power of the heart itself it use both an ultrasonic dimension arrangement of the heart and a catheter carry a thermistor insert into the bloodstream the latter measure the heat carry away by the bloodstream a an indication of the velocity of the blood flow it be also possible to utilize a pressure transducer mount at the end of a catheter which be insert into the heart s leave ventricle to indicate the blood pressure in the heart itself this pressure measurement may be make at the same time that the ultrasonic dimension measurement be make a simplify version of the instrumentation for this procedure be show in fig 2 output of the two system be measure by a pulse-timing circuit and a resistance bridge follow by a simple analogue computer which feed a multichannel recorder from this doctor can read heart rate change in diameter pressure and effective heart power radio-transmitter pill several year ago headline be make by a small radio transmitter capsule which could be swallow by the patient and which would then radio internal pressure data to external receiver this original capsule contain a battery and a transistor oscillator and be about 1 cm in diameter battery life limit the use of this pill to about 8 to 30 hour maximum a refinement of this technique have be describe by drs zworykin and farrar and mr berkely of the medical electronics center of the rockefeller institute in this novel arrangement the pill be much small and contain only a resonant circuit in which the capacitor be form by a pressure-sensing transducer a show in fig 4 an external antenna be place over or around the patient and excite 3000 time a second with short 400-kc burst the energy receive by the pill cause the resonant circuit to ring on after the burst and this ring take place at the resonant frequency of the pill these frequency be amplify and detect by the fm receiver after each burst of transmit energy and after the pill have be calibrate precise internal pressure indication can be obtain one of the advantage of this method be that the pill can remain in the patient for several day permit observation under natural condition application to organ other than the gastrointestinal tract be plan for future experiment sonar in medical research one of the most gratify application of an important technique of submarine detection be in the exploration of the human body we reader be familiar with the principle of sonar where sound wave be send out in water and the echo then indicate submerge object various method of pulse scan and display these sound wave be use to detect submarine map ocean floor and even communicate under water in medicine the frequency be much high transducer and the sonar beam themselves be much small and different scan technique may be use but the principle involve be the same a in sonar because the body contain so much liquid transmission of ultrasonic signal proceed fairly well in muscle and blood vessel bone and cartilage transmit poorly and tend to reflect the ultrasonic signal base on this phenomenon a number of investigator have use this method to look through human organ a good example of the result obtainable with ultrasonic radiation be contain in paper present by dr g baum who have explore the human eye he can diagnose detachment of the retina where conventional method indicate blindness due to glaucoma the method use to scan the eye ultrasonically be illustrate in fig 6 the transducer be couple to the body through a water bath not show for display dr baum use a portion of an afj an airborne radar indicator and then photograph the screen to obtain a permanent record a typical sonogram of a human eye together with a description of the anatomical part be show in fig 5 the frequency use for these experiment be 15 mc and the transducer be a specially cut crystal with an epoxy lens capable of provide beam diameter small than one millimeter the transducer itself move the beam in a sector scan just like a radar antenna while the entire transducer structure be move over a 90-degree arc in front of the eye to look into all corner the total picture be only see by the camera which integrate the many sector scan over the entire 90-degree rotation period drs howry and holmes at the university of colorado medical school have apply the same sonar technique to other area of soft tissue and have obtain extremely good result by submerge the patient in a tub and rotate the transducer while the scan go on they have be able to get cross-section view of the neck a show in fig 7 a well a many other hitherto impossible insight a mention before bone reflect the sound energy and in fig 7 the portion of the spine show a the black area in the center artery and vein be apparent by they black blood-filled center and the surround white wall a cross-section of a normal low human leg be show in fig 8 with the various part label
