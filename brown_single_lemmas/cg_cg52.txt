 let he become honest and they discard he but let he be ready to invent whatever falsehood to assail whatever character and to prostitute he paper to whatever end and they hug he to they heart in proportion to the degradation of he moral worth be the increase of he worth to they to exonerate the legislature and thereby extricate himself from a sticky situation pike take another course and make it appear that the legislature have be bilk he claim in he attack that woodruff with scurrilous underhandedness have deliberately write an ambiguous bid that have so confuse the honest member of the legislature that they have award he the contract without know what they be do the charge be so farfetched that woodruff pay little attention to it and answer pike in a rather bore way wearily declare that a new hand be pump the bellow of the crittenden organ and conclude in a controversy with an adversary so utterly destitute of moral principle even a triumph would entitle the victor to no laurel the game be not worth the ammunition it would cost we therefore leave the writer to the enjoyment of the unenvied reputation which the personal abuse he have heap on we will entitle he to from the low and vulgar herd to which he belong despite woodruff s continue refusal to debate with pike through the column of he newspaper pike do not let up he attack for a moment over the month he become a political gadfly with an incessant barrage of satirical poem ridicule woodruff the casca letter belittle woodruff and long analytical article vilify woodruff so persistent be these attack that in march of the follow year woodruff be finally move to action and pike be to learn he first lesson in frontier politics the subtle art of diversion to attack pike directly would gain woodruff little for a a penniless newcomer pike have nothing to lose by this time woodruff have accurately measure pike a a man of great personal pride a man who would fly into a tower rage if he integrity be question and who would be anxious to avenge himself pike s honor would now come under attack but not by woodruff himself the charge would be make in the gazette by an anonymous correspondent and pike would be so busy try to track down the illusive character assassin that he would forget about harass woodruff the strategy work perfectly pike be stun by the first blast against he character which be publish in the march 4th issue of the gazette under the name vale the anonymous correspondent do not resort to innuendoes he call pike a thief he say pike have steal mule from harris during the santa fe expedition he accuse pike of continue he sticky-fingered career in arkansas with the theft of some otter skin in van buren the charge catch pike off balance come a they do from an unexpect quarter outraged he use the advocate of march 7th for a denial send immediately to santa fe and van buren for document to vindicate himself and demand that woodruff reveal the name of this perfidious slanderer who disguise himself under a pastoral pseudonym woodruff say nothing and pike frustrate storm throughout little rock in an unsuccessful search for vale ask he friend to keep they ear open finally he learn through the grapevine that the culprit might be one jame w robinson in pope county without far inquiry pike jump to the conclusion that robinson be guilty and follow the honorable route that would eventually lead to the dueling ground send a message to robinson through he friend demand that he either confirm or deny he complicity robinson do neither to pike silence be tantamount to an admission of guilt and he determine to get robinson onto the dueling ground at all cost on april 11th he write an open letter in the advocate make it know to the world that jas w robinson be by he own admission a base liar and a slanderer if robinson be a liar and a slanderer he be also a very canny gentleman for nothing that pike could do would pry so much a a single word out of he preoccupy with he own defense and he attempt to get robinson to fight pike lessen he attack on woodruff and finally stop they altogether and pike never do find out if robinson be really responsible for the vale letter woodruff s strategy have be immensely successful it take pike a long time to realize what woodruff have do and it have a profound effect on he once he learn a lesson he never forget it in the next few month of comparative silence pike wait patiently until condition be perfect for a new attack and then display a remarkable grasp of the subtlety of political infighting gain from he first bout with woodruff he use these change condition to excellent advantage shortly after the vale incident a rift begin to develop between william woodruff and governor pope one-armed gruff frugally honest governor pope have be the ideal man to assume office in arkansas after the disgraceful antic of political boss like crittenden and he rule the state with an iron fist tolerate no nonsense woodruff have support he all the way both a a chief executive and a a man besides be political ally they be also friend this warm relationship come to an abrupt end in june of 1834 when the national congress appropriate $ 3000 for compile and print the law of arkansas territory and take note of the recent wave of corruption in the legislature leave it to the governor to award the contract woodruff want this political windfall very badly and everyone assume that he would get it because he be a close friend of the governor and he stanchest supporter after all woodruff own a competent print plant and be the logical man for the job but because the governor be determine that friendship should not influence he one way or the other he look for a printer with a knowledge of the law which woodruff do not have and award the contract to a lawyer name john steele who have start a newspaper in helena the year before woodruff be furious consider the governor s act a personal rebuff he air he feeling in the gazette on august 26 1834 we think the governor treat we rather shabbily to say the least of it it be but justice to mr steele for we to add that in the above remark nothing be intend to he disparagement either a a lawyer or a a printer he get a good fat job and we congratulate he on he good luck we hope that he will execute it in a manner that will entitle he to credit a summer cool into fall and winter even so the relationship between the two man continue to grow cold by the day and by december of 1834 it be icy it be at this point that pike decide to capitalize on the bad feeling between the two man the eventual prize in this new battle be the public print contract that woodruff still hold from he first bout with the canny woodruff pike have learn that it be good not to attack he directly so harp on the theme that the cost of print be too high he condemn the governor for permit such a state of affair to exist to document he charge pike set up two parallel column in the advocate show the price charge by the gazette and the considerably low price for which the work could be do elsewhere then he call on the governor to explain why the governor be not use to have he integrity question and he promptly pass the charge on to woodruff demand that woodruff answer they if woodruff could not furnish a strong explanation the governor insist that he low he price in accord with the scale print in the advocate woodruff be now impale on the horn of a dilemma a a proud man he prestige would suffer if he let pike dictate to he through the governor s office but to low he price would be tantamount to an admission that they have be too high in the first place a a consequence he do neither very angry at woodruff the governor use he personal influence to have the print contract withdraw from the gazette and award to the low bidder which by a strange coincidence happen to be pike s advocate and for the moment at least the governor now find himself ally with the head of the crittenden faction he have formerly oppose and pike be credit with a clear triumph over woodruff but in the confuse atmosphere of frontier politics alliance be a quickly break a they be form and a pike come to favor with the governor of the territory the governor fall out of favor with the president of the unite state on january 28 1835 andrew jackson remove pope from office and elevate territorial secretary william s fulton to the position fulton be a very close friend of jackson and have be he private secretary for a number of year in the old day a a stanch party man and a rabid democrat he have little tolerance for whig like pike and pike lose any immediate personal advantage he victory over woodruff might have gain he 2 a pike prove himself adept in the political arena he also become a social lion in the village of little rock where he serve a a symbol of the culture that the lady of the town be strive so eagerly to cultivate after all pike be an establish poet and he work have be publish in the respectable periodical of that center of american culture boston he accomplishment and the fact that he be resident do much to offset the unkind word traveler use to describe little rock after a visit there for some reason none of they be impress with the territorial capital the internationally know sportsman and traveler friedrich gerstacker be typical of it detractor in the mid-thirties little rock be a vile detestable place he write little rock be without any flattery one of the dull town in the unite state and i would not have remain two hour in the place if i have not meet with some good friend who make i forget it dreariness pike enjoy he new social position tremendously and cultivate in himself those trait necessary to it preservation he be especially popular with woman for like the romantic poetry he write he be personally gracious gallant and chivalrous he again begin to play the violin and tuck the instrument
