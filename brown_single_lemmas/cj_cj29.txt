control of socioeconomic status it would have be desirable for the two community to have differ only in respect to the variable be investigate the degree of structure in teach method the structure school be in an industrial city with three-family tenement house typical of the residential area but with one rather sizable section of middle-class home the unstructured school be in a large suburban community predominantly middle - to upper-middle class but fringe by an industrial area in order to equate the sample on socioeconomic status we choose school in both city on the basis of socioeconomic status of the neighborhood school principal and guidance worker make rating of the various neighborhood and the research team make independent observation of house and dwelling area an objective scale be develop for rate school neighborhood from these data equal proportion of child in each city be draw from upper-lower and lower-middle class neighborhood subject individual difference in maturation and the development of readiness for learn to read indicate that not until the third grade have most child have ample opportunity to demonstrate they capacity for school achievement therefore third-grade child be choose a subject for this study for purpose of sample selection only individual test be give late we obtain group test score of read achievement and intelligence from school record of the entire third-grade population in each school system the subject for this study be randomly select from stratify area of the distribution one-third a underachiever one-third medium and one-third over-achiever child whose read score be at least one standard deviation below the regression line of each total third-grade school population be consider under-achiever for the purpose of sample selection over-achiever be at least one standard deviation above the regression line in they school system the final sample be not significantly different from a normal distribution in regard to read achievement or intelligence test score twenty-four classroom in twelve unstructured school furnish 156 case 87 boy and 69 girl eight classroom in three structure school furnish 72 case 36 boy and 36 girl administrative restriction necessitate the small sample size in the structure school it be assume that the sample procedure be purely random with respect to the personality variable under investigation rate scale of compulsivity an interview schedule of open-ended question and a multiple-choice questionnaire be prepare and one parent of each of the sample child be see in the home the parent be ask to describe the child s typical behavior in certain standard situation in which there be an opportunity to observe tendency toward perfectionism in demand upon self and other irrational conformity to rule orderliness punctuality and need for certainty the interviewer be instruct not to suggest answer and a much a possible to record the parent actual word a they describe the child s behavior in home situation the rate scale of compulsivity be construct by first peruse the interview record categorize all evidence relate to compulsivity then arrange a distribution of such information apart from the case record final rating be make on the basis of a point system which be develop after study the distribution of actual behavior record and assign weight value to each type of behavior that be deviant from the discover norm child score high in compulsivity be those who give evidence of tension or emotionality in situation where there be lack of organization or conformity to standard and expectation or who make exaggerate effort to achieve these goal the low compulsive child be one who appear relatively unconcerned about such matter for instance the follow statement be rate low in compulsivity she s naturally quite neat about thing but it do nt bother she at all if she room get messy but she clean it up very well when i remind she measurement of anxiety castaneda et al revise the taylor anxiety scale for use with child the taylor scale be adapt from the minnesota multiphastic personality inventory with item selection base upon clinical definition of anxiety there be much research evidence to validate the use of the instrument in differentiate individual who be likely to manifest anxiety in vary degree reliability and validation work with the child s anxiety scale by castaneda et al demonstrate result closely similar to the finding with the adult scale although the taylor scale be design a a group test device in this study it be individually administer by psychologically train worker who establish rapport and assist the child in read the item relationship of anxiety to compulsivity the question may be raise whether or not we be deal with a common factor in anxiety and compulsivity the two rating yield a correlation of which be not significantly different from zero therefore we have measure two different characteristic in theory compulsive behavior be a way of diminish anxiety and one might expect a negative association except for the possibility that for many child the obsessive-compulsive defense be not sufficient to quell the amount of anxiety they suffer the issue of interaction between anxiety and compulsivity will be take up late criterion measurement in the primary grade read permeate almost every aspect of school progress and the child s early experience of success or failure in learn to read often set a pattern of total achievement that be relatively endure throughout the follow year in establish criterion measurement it be therefore think good to broaden the scope beyond the read act itself the predict interaction effect should if potent extend it influence over all academic achievement the stanford achievement test form j be administer by classroom teacher consist of a battery of six sub-test paragraph mean word mean spell language arithmetic computation and arithmetic reason all of these sub-test involve read except arithmetic computation score be state in grade-equivalents on a national norm the battery median grade-equivalent be use in data analysis in this study the wechsler intelligence scale for child be administer to each sample third-grade child by a clinical worker the relationship of intelligence test score to school achievement be a well-established fact in this case afj therefore in the investigation of the present hypothesis it be necessary to control this factor the criterion score use in the statistical analysis be an index of over - or under-achievement it be the discrepancy between the actual attain achievement test score and the score that would be predict by the iq for example on the basis of the regression equation a child with an iq of 120 in this sample would be expect to earn an achievement test score of 48 grade equivalent if a child with an iq of 120 score 55 in achievement he discrepancy score would be represent of one year of over-achievement a child with an iq of 98 would be expect to earn an achievement test score of 35 if such a child score 30 he discrepancy score would be -5 represent of one year of under-achievement in this manner the factor measure by the intelligence test be control allow discover difference in achievement to be interpret a result from other variable result test of interaction of compulsivity and teach method table 1 and 2 present the result of the statistical analysis of the data when compulsivity be use a the descriptive variable figure 1 portray the mean achievement score of each sub-group graphically first of all a we have surmise the highly compulsive child in the structure set score significantly good afj on achievement than do similar child in the unstructured school it can be see too that when we contrast level of compulsivity within the structure school the high compulsive child do good afj no significant difference be find in achievement between high and low compulsive child within the unstructured school the hypothesis of there be an interaction between compulsivity and teach method be support in this case at the level while we have expect that compulsive child in the unstructured school set would have difficulty when compare to those in the structure we be surprise to find that the achievement of the high compulsive within the school where the whole-word method be use in begin read compare favorably with that of the low compulsive indeed they achievement score be somewhat good on an absolute basis although the difference be not significant we speculate that compulsive in the unstructured school be under great strain because of the lack of systemization in they school set but that they need to organize for comfort be so intense that they struggle to induce the phonic rule and achieve in spite of the lack of direction from the environment it be interest to note that medium compulsive in the unstructured school make the low achievement score although not significantly low possibly they compulsivity be not strong enough to cause they to build they own structure we conjecture be then that regardless of the manner in which school lesson be teach the compulsive child accentuate those element of each lesson that aid he in systematize he work when help by a high degree of structure in lesson presentation then and only then do such a child attain unusual success test of interaction of anxiety and teach method the statistical analysis of achievement in relation to anxiety and teach method and the interaction of the two be present in table 3 and 4 figure 2 be a graph of the mean achievement score of each group a predict the highly anxious child in the unstructured school score more poorly afj than those in the structure school the interaction effect which be significant at the level can be see good in the contrast of mean score while high anxiety child achieve significantly less well afj in the unstructured school than do low anxiety child they appear to do at least a well a the average in the structure classroom the most strike aspect of the interaction demonstrate be the mark decrement in performance suffer by the highly anxious child in unstructured school accord to the theory propose this be a consequence of the severe condition of perceive threat that persist unabated for the anxious child in an ambiguous sort of school environment the fact that such threat be potent in the begin read lesson be think to be a vital factor in the continue pattern of failure or under-achievement these child exhibit the child with high anxiety may first direct he anxiety-released energy toward achievement but because he distress severely reduce the ability of discrimination and memorization of complex symbol the child may fail in he initial attempt to master the problem failure confirm the threat and the intensity of anxiety be increase a the require learn become more difficult so that by the time the child reach the third grade the decrement in performance be pronounce the individual with high anxiety in the structure classroom may approach the learn task with the same increase energy and lower power of discrimination but the symbol he be ask to learn be simple a show early the highly anxious individual may be superior in he memorize of simple element success reduce the prospect of threat and he power of discrimination be improve by the time the child first attack the actual problem of read he be completely familiar and at ease with all of the element of word apparently academic challenge in the structure set create an optimum of stress so that the child with high anxiety be able to achieve because he be arouse to an energetic state without become confuse or panicked sarason et al present evidence that the anxious child will suffer in the test-like situation and that he performance will be impair unless he receive support and accept treatment from the teacher although the present study be not a direct replication of they investigation the result do not confirm they conclusion observer in the two school system study here judge the teacher in the structure school to be more impersonal and demand while the atmosphere in the unstructured school be judge to be more support and accept yet the highly anxious child suffer a tremendous disadvantage only in the unstructured school and perform a well or good than average in the structure set
