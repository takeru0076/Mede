in poughkeepsie ny in 1952 a roman catholic hospital present seven protestant physician with an ultimatum to quit the plan parenthood federation or to resign from the hospital staff three agree but four decline and be suspend after a flood of protest they be reinstate at the begin of 1953 the peace of the community be badly disturb and people across the nation read of the incident feel uneasy in new york city in 1958 the city s commissioner of hospital refuse to permit a physician to provide a protestant mother with a contraceptive device he thereby precipitate a bitter controversy involve protestant jew and roman catholic that continue for two month until the city s board of hospital lift the ban on birth-control therapy a year late in albany ny a roman catholic hospital bar an orthopedic surgeon because of he connection with the plan parenthood association immediately the religious group of the city be embroil in an angry dispute over the allege invasion of a man s right to freedom of religious belief and conscience these incident typical of many other dramatize the distressing fact that no controversy during the last several decade have cause more tension rancor and strife among religious group in this country than the birth-control issue it have flare up periodically on the front page of newspaper in community divide over birth-prevention regulation in municipal hospital and health and family-welfare agency it have erupt on the national level in the matter of include birth-control information and material in foreign aid to underdeveloped country where it be not actually erupt it rumble and smolders in sullen resentment like a volcano ready to explode at any moment the time have come for citizen of all faith to unite in an effort to remove this divisive and nettlesome issue from the political and social life of we nation the first step toward the goal be the establishment of a new atmosphere of mutual good will and friendly communication on other than the polemical level instead of emotional recrimination load phrase and sloganeer we need a dispassionate study of the fact a good understand of the opposite viewpoint and a more serious effort to extend the area of agreement until a solution be reach all too frequently point out jame ogara manage editor of commonweal catholic run roughshod over protestant sensibility in this matter by failure to consider the reason behind the protestant position and particularly by they jibe at the fact that protestant opinion on birth control have change in recent decade all too often we language be unduly harsh the second step be to recognize the substantial agreement frequently blur by emotionalism and inaccurate newspaper report already exist between catholic and non-catholic concern the over-all objective of family plan instead of catholic be oblige or even encourage to beget the great possible number of offspring a many non-catholic imagine the ideal of responsible parenthood be stress family plan be encourage so that parent will be able to provide properly for they offspring pope pius 12 declare in 1951 that it be possible to be exempt from the normal obligation of parenthood for a long time and even for the whole duration of marry life if there be serious reason such a those often mention in the so-called medical eugenic economic and social indication this mean that such factor a the health of the parent particularly the mother they ability to provide they child with the necessity of life the degree of population density of a country and the shortage of house facility may legitimately be take into consideration in determine the number of offspring these be substantially the same factor consider by non-catholic in family plan the law of many state permit birth control only for medical reason the roman catholic church however sanction a much more liberal policy on family plan catholic protestant and jew be in agreement over the objective of family plan but disagree over the method to be use the roman catholic church sanction only abstention or the rhythm method also know a the use of the infertile or safe period the church consider this to be the method provide by nature and it divine author it involve no frustration of nature s law but simply an intelligent and discipline use of they with the exception of the roman catholic and the orthodox catholic church most church make no moral distinction between rhythm and mechanical or chemical contraceptive allow the couple free choice there be a difference in theological belief where there seem little chance of agreement the ground for the church s position be scriptural old testament the teaching of the father and doctor of the early church the unbroken tradition of nineteen century the decision of the high ecclesiastical authority and the natural law the latter play a prominent role in roman catholic theology and be consider decisive entirely apart from scripture in determine the ethical character of birth-prevention method the roman catholic natural-law tradition regard a self-evident that the primary objective purpose of the conjugal act be procreation and that the foster of the mutual love of the spouse be the secondary and subjective end this conclusion be base on two proposition that man by the use of he reason can ascertain god s purpose in the universe and that god make know he purpose by certain give physical arrangement thus man can readily deduce that the primary objective end of the conjugal act be procreation the propagation of the race moreover man may not supplant or frustrate the physical arrangement establish by god who through the law of rhythm have provide a natural method for the control of conception believe that god be the author of this law and of all law of nature roman catholic believe that they be oblige to obey those law not frustrate or mock they let it be grant then that the theological difference in this area between protestant and roman catholic appear to be irreconcilable but people differ in they religious belief on score of doctrine without take up arm against those who disagree with they why be it so different in regard to birth control it be because each side have seek to implement it distinctive theological belief through legislation and thus indirectly force it belief or at least the practical consequence thereof upon other it be always a temptation for a religious organization especially a powerful or dominant one to impose through the clench fist of the law it creedal viewpoint upon other both roman catholic and protestant have succumb to this temptation in the past consider what happen during world war 1 when the protestant church unite to push the prohibition law through congress many of they sincerely believe that the use of liquor in any form or in any degree be intrinsically evil and sinful with over four million american man away at war protestant force they distinctive theological belief upon the general public with the return of we soldier it soon become apparent that the belief be not share by the great majority of citizen the attempt to enforce that belief usher in a reign of bootlegger racketeer hijacker and gangster that lead to a breakdown of law unparalleled in we history the so-called noble experiment come to an inglorious end that tumultuous painful and costly experience show clearly that a law express a moral judgment can not be enforce when it have little correspondence with the general view of society that experience hold a lesson for we all in regard to birth control today up to the turn of the century contraception be condemn by all christian church a immoral unnatural and contrary to divine law this be generally reflect in the civil law of christian country today the roman catholic and orthodox church stand virtually alone in hold that conviction the various lambeth conference express the anglican viewpoint mirror the gradual change that have take place among protestant generally in 1920 the lambeth conference repeat it 1908 condemnation of contraception and issue an emphatic warn against the use of unnatural mean for the avoidance of conception together with the grave danger physical moral and religious thereby incur and against the evil which the extension of such use threaten the race denounce the view that the sexual union be an end in itself the conference declare we steadfastly uphold what must always be regard a the govern consideration of christian marriage one be the primary purpose for which marriage exist namely the continuance of the race through the gift and heritage of child the other be the paramount importance in marry life of deliberate and thoughtful self-control the conference call for a vigorous campaign against the open or secret sale of contraceptive in 1930 the lambeth conference again affirm the primary purpose of marriage to be the procreation of child but concede that in certain limit circumstance contraception might be morally legitimate in 1958 the conference endorse birth control a the responsibility lay by god on parent everywhere many other protestant denomination precede the anglican in such action in march 1931 22 out of 28 member of a committee of the federal council of church ratify artificial method of birth control a to the necessity the committee declare for some form of effective control of the size of the family and the space of child and consequently of control of conception there can be no question there be general agreement also that sex union between husband and wife a an expression of mutual affection without relation to procreation be right since then many protestant denomination have make separate pronouncement in which they not only approve birth control but declare it at time to be a religious duty what determine the morality they state be not the mean use but the motive in general the mean exclude abortion that prove most effective be consider the most ethical this development be reflect in the action take in february 1961 by the general board of the national council of church the large protestant organization in the afj the board approve and commend the use of birth-control device a a part of christian responsibility in family plan it call for opposition to law and institutional practice restrict the information or availability of contraceptive the general board declare most of the protestant church hold contraception and periodic continence to be morally right when the motive be right the general protestant conviction be that motive rather than method form the primary moral issue provide the method be limit to the prevention of conception an action once universally condemn by all christian church and forbid by the civil law be now not only approve by the overwhelming majority of protestant denomination but also deem at certain time to be a positive religious duty this viewpoint have now be translate into action by the majority of people in this country repeat poll have disclose that most marry couple be now use contraceptive in the practice of birth control for all concern with social-welfare legislation the significance of this radical and revolutionary change in the think and habit of the vast majority of the american people be clear profound and far-reaching to try to oppose the general religious and moral conviction of such a majority by a legislative fiat would be to invite the same breakdown of law and order that be occasion by the ill-starred prohibition experiment this bring we to the fact that the reality we be deal with lie not in the field of civil legislation but in the realm of conscience and religion they be moral judgment and matter of theological belief conscience and religion be concern with private sin the civil law be concern with public crime only confusion failure and anarchy result when the effort be make to impose upon the civil authority the impossible task of police private home to preclude the possibility of sin among the chief victim of such an ill-conceived imposition would be religion itself
