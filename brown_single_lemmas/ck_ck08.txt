rousseau be so persuasive that voltaire be almost convince that he should burn he book too but while the two man be ride into the country where they be go to dinner they be attack in the dark of the forest by a band of thief who strip they of everything include most of they clothe you must be a very learn man say voltaire to one of the bandit a learn man the bandit laugh in he face but voltaire persevere he go to the chief himself at what university do you study he ask he refuse to believe that the bandit chief never attend a high institution to have become so corrupt he say surely you must have study many art and science the chief annoy by these question knock voltaire down and shout at he that he not only never go to any school but never even learn how to read when finally the two bedraggled man reach they friend s home voltaire s fear be once again arouse for it be such a distinguish place with such fine work of art and such a big library that there can be little doubt but that the owner have become deprave by all this culture to voltaire s surprise however they host give they fresh clothe to put on open he purse to lend they money and sit they down before a good dinner immediately after dinner however rousseau ask for still another favor could he have pen and paper please he be in a hurry to write another essay against culture such be the impromptu that voltaire give to howl of laughter at sans souci and that be soon circulate in manuscript throughout the literary circle of europe to be print sometime late but with the name of timon of athens the famous misanthrope substitute for that of rousseau how cruel but at the same time how understandable how could the rich for whom life be make so simple ever understand the subterfuge the lie the fraud the error sin and even crime to which the poor be drive in they effort to overcome the great advantage the rich have in the race of life how for example could a voltaire understand the strange predicament in which a rousseau would find himself when soon after the furor of he first discourse he acquire still another title to fame this time a a musician a a composer ever since he have first begin to study music and to teach it rousseau have dream of pierce through to fame a the result of a successful opera but he facility in this genre be not great and he effort to get a performance for he gallant muse invariably fail and for good reason he operatic music have little merit but then one day while on a week s visit to the country home of a retire swiss jeweler rousseau amuse the company with a few little melody he have write to which he attach no great importance he be really amaze to discover the other guest so excite about these delicate little song put a few such song together they urge he string they onto some sort of little plot and you ll have a delightful operetta he do nt believe they nonsense he say this be the sort of stuff i write and then throw away heaven forbid cry the lady enchant by he music you must make an opera out of this material and they would nt leave off argue and plead until he have promise oh the irony and the bitterness of it that after all he year of effort to become a composer he should now now when he be still stoutly reply to the critic of he discourse on the art and science be so close to a success in music and have to reject it or at least appear to reject it but what else could he do you could nt on the one hand decry the art and at the same time practice they could you well yes perhaps in literature since you could argue that you could nt keep silent about you feeling against literature and so be involve in spite of yourself but now music too no that would be too much and the fault of course be rameau s the fault be rameau s and that of the whole culture of this parisian age for it be rameau s type of music that he have be try to write and that he could nt write these little song however be sweet nothing from the heart tender memory of he childhood little melody that anyone could hum and that would make one want to weep but no he could nt appear a a composer now that glory crave for so long be now forbid to he still just for the lady and just for this once for this one weekend in the country he would make a little piece out of he melody the lady be delight and jeans jacques be applaud and everyone go to work to learn the part which he write but then after the little operetta have be give it feeble amateur render everyone insist that it be too good to be lose forever and that the royal academy of music must now have the manuscript in order to give it the really first-rate performance it merit rousseau be aware that he must seem like a hypocrite stand there and argue that he could not possibly permit a public performance the lady especially could nt understand what trouble he a contradiction bah what be a contradiction in one s life every woman have have the experience of say no when she mean yes and say yes when she mean no rousseau have to admit that though he could nt agree to a public performance he would indeed just for he own private satisfaction dearly love to know how he work would sound when do by professional musician and by train voice i d simply like to know if it be a good a you kind people seem to think he say duclos the historian point out to jeans jacques that this be impossible the musician of the royal opera would not rehearse a work merely to see how it would sound merely to satisfy the author s curiosity rousseau agree but he recall that rameau have once have a private performance of he opera armide behind close door just for himself alone duclos understand what be bother rousseau that the writer of the prosopopoeia of fabricius should now become know a the writer of an amuse little operetta that would certainly be paradoxical but duclos think he see a way out let i do the submit to the royal academy he suggest you name will never appear no one will even suspect that it be you work to that rousseau could agree but now what crazy twist and turn of he emotion afraid at one and the same time that he work might be turn down which would be a blow to he pride even though no one know he be the author and that the work would be accept and then that he violent feeling in the matter would certainly betray how deeply concern he be in spite of himself and how anxious this lover of obscurity be for applause and thus tear between he desire to be know a the composer of a successful opera and the necessity of remain true to he proclaim desire for anonymity rousseau suffer through several painful week all these emotion be screw up to new height when after acceptance and the first rehearsal there ensue such a buzz of excitement among parisian music lover that duclos have to come run to rousseau to inform he that the news have reach the superintendent of the king s amusement and that he be now demand that the work be offer first at the royal summer palace of fontainebleau imagine the honor of it what be you answer jeans jacques ask strive to appear unimpressed i refuse duclos say what else could i do monsieur de cury be incense of course but i say i would first have to get the author s permission and i be certain he would refuse how infuriate all this be why have not this success come to he before he have plunge into he discourse and before he have commit himself to a life of austerity and denial now when everything be open up to he even the court of louis 15 he have to play a role of self-effacement back and forth duclos have to go between m de cury and jeans jacques and between the duke daumont and jeans jacques again a he little operetta the village soothsayer though still unperformed take on ever more importance and of course the news of who the composer be do finally begin to get around among he close friend but they naturally keep he secret well and the public at large know only of a great excitement in musical and court circle how titillate it be to go among people who do not know he a the composer but who talk in the most glow term of the promise of the piece after have hear the first rehearsal the furor be such that people who could not possibly have squirm they way into the rehearsal be pretend that they be intimate with the whole affair and that it would be sensational and listen to such a conversation one morning while take a cup of chocolate in a cafe rousseau find himself bathe in perspiration tremble lest he authorship become know and at the same time dream of the startle effect he would make if he should proclaim himself suddenly a the composer he feel himself now a he himself say in he confession at a crucial point of he life and that be why on the day of the performance when a carriage from the royal stable call to take he to the palace he do not bother to shave on the contrary he be please that he face show a neglect of several day see he in that condition and about to enter the hall where the king the queen the whole royal family and all the member of the high aristocracy would be present grimm and the abbe raynal and other try to stop he you can nt go in that way they cry why not jeans jacques ask who be go to stop i you have nt dress for the occasion they point out to he i m dress a i always be rousseau say neither good nor bad at home yes they argue but here you be in the palace there s the king and madame de pompadour if they be here then surely i have the right to be here rousseau say and even more right since i be the composer but in such a slovenly condition what be slovenly about i rousseau ask be it because of i slovenliness that hair grow on i face surely it would grow there whether i wash myself or not a hundred year ago i would have wear a beard with pride and those without beard would have stand out a not dress for the occasion now time have change and i must pretend that hair do nt grow on i face that s the fashion and fashion be the real king here not louis 15 since even he obey now if you do nt mind i should like to hear i own piece perform but of course behind he boldness he do nt feel bold at all he tremble lest he piece should fail and this in addition to he usual fear of be among people of high society he fear of make some inane or inappropriate remark and even deep than that he fear lest in this close hall he should suddenly itch to relieve himself could he walk out in the midst of he piece here before the court before the king
