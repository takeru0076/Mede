organization in this publication measurement of interfacial angle of crystal be use to classify and identify chemical substance tv barker who develop the classification-angle system be about to begin the systematic compilation of the index when he die in 1931 the compilation work be undertake by a number of interest crystallographer in the department of mineralogy of the university museum at oxford since 1948 the work headquarters have be the department of geology and mineralogy numerous cooperate individual in great britain holland the unite state and belgium have contribute editorially or by make calculation great interest and practical help have be give by the barker index committee financial and material help have come from academic governmental and industrial organization in england and holland editor for volume 1 and 2 be mw porter and the late rc spiller both of oxford university a third volume remain to be publish substance volume 1 deal with 2991 compound belong to the tetragonal hexagonal and trigonal and orthorhombic system and volume 2 with about 3500 monoclinic substance volume 3 in preparation will treat the anorthic compound describe in groth s chemische krystallographie property the barker system be base on the use of the small number of interfacial angle necessary for index purpose other morphological physical and optical property value be also give source of data the index be essentially a new treatment of previously compile morphological data most of the data use be from groth s chemische krystallographie criticality every calculation have be make independently by two worker and check by one of the editor use of nomenclature symbol unit physical constant accept crystallographic symbolism have be use other symbol relate to the index necessarily have be introduce currency this publication cover the old literature groth there be no mechanism for keep the volume up to date format the publication form be that of clothbound book the data be present in list and table part 1 in both volume be label introduction and table the table include those for the classification angle refractive index and melt point of the various type of crystal part 2 of volume 1 and part 2 and 3 of volume 2 contain the crystal description these be group into section accord to the crystal system and within each section compound be arrange in the same order a in groth s chemische krystallographie an alphabetical list of chemical and mineralogical name with reference number enable one to find a particular crystal description reference to the data source be give in the crystal description publication and distribution the barker index be publish for the barker index committee by w heffer & son ltd 4 petty cury cambridge england volume 1 contain part 1 and 2 be publish in 1951 volume 2 in three part in 1956 the two volume be available from the publisher for $ 1680 and $ 2800 respectively 2-2 crystal data organization the present edition of crystal data be write by jdh donnay the john hopkins university baltimore md part 2 and werner nowacki university of berne switzerland part 1 with the collaboration of gabrielle donnay we geological survey washington d c many collaborator in the unite state and switzerland help in collect and assemble data in make calculation and in edit support come from academic and industrial group in these two country the geological society of america give a grant-in-aid to complete the work and bear the expense of publication preparation of a second edition be in progress under the sponsorship of the crystal data committee of the american crystallographic association coeditors be jdh donnay ge cox of leed university and olga kennard of the national council for medical research london financial grant have be receive from the national science foundation and the british institute of physics for the compilation work and the publication cost the continuity of the project be suggest by plan for an eventual third edition substance element alloy inorganic and organic compound metal data will not be include in the second edition since these have be collect independently by wb pearson national research council ottawa and publish a a handbook of lattice spacing and structure of metal and alloy by pergamon press property crystallographic data result mainly from x-ray and electron diffraction measurement be present cell dimension number of formula unit per cell space group and specific gravity be give for all substance for some substance auxiliary property such a the melt point be give source of data part 1 of the present edition cover the literature to mid-1948 part 2 up to the end of 1951 much of the material come directly from secondary source such a strukturbericht criticality the vast number of compound to be cover the limit resource to do the job and the immediate need for this type of compilation preclude a thorough evaluation of all available data in the present edition future edition may be more critical use of nomenclature symbol unit physical constant since part 1 and 2 be prepare independently the abbreviation scheme and the chemical symbol use differ in the two part the second edition should have great uniformity currency a second edition be in preparation and there be long range plan for a third format data in the present edition be present in table and list part 1 deal with the classification of crystalline substance by space group and be not a numerical data compilation the compound be divide accord to composition into seven category part 2 contain determinative table for the identification of crystalline substance these be arrange accord to crystal system there be formula and name index cover both part reference for part 1 be give at the end and for part 2 in the table publication and distribution the present edition of crystal data afj publish in 1954 a memoir 60 of the geological society of america be now out of print the manuscript of the second edition will probably be ready by the end of 1960 2-3 crystal structure organization the author of crystal structure be ralph wg wyckoff university of arizona tucson arizona the first section of this publication appear in 1948 and the last supplement in 1960 though now complete the publication be include in this directory because of it importance and because of the long-term nature of it preparation substance element inorganic and organic compound no alloy property the data present be derive almost entirely from x-ray diffraction measurement and include atomic coordinate cell dimension and atomic and ionic radius source of data publish literature criticality the aim be to state the result of all available determination of atomic position in crystal presumably the tabulate data be good available value the critical comment in the textual section of this publication be invaluable use of nomenclature symbol unit physical constant the terminology use conform to that of internationale tabellen zur bestimmung von kristallstrukturen currency during the year of publication supplement and replacement sheet be issue periodically coverage of the literature extend through 1954 and include some 1955 reference it be to be hope that some way will be find to keep this important work current format the publication form be that of loose-leaf sheet afj contain in binder the book be divide into chapter and in each chapter the material be group into text table illustration and bibliography each group be paginate separately number sometimes follow by letter be use so that insertion can be make inorganic structure be find in chapter 2 - 12 organic structure in chapter 13 - 15 within each chapter an effort have be make to group together those crystal with similar structure there be three index ie an inorganic formula index a mineralogical name index and a name index to organic compound publication and distribution publisher of crystal structure be interscience publisher 250 fifth avenue new york 1 n y the work consist of four section and 5 supplement price of the complete work include all necessary binder be $ 14850 2-4 dana s system of mineralogy organization six edition of jame dwight dana s system appear between 1837 and 1892 in 1915 edward s dana editor of the sixth edition ask we ford of yale university to prepare a seventh edition of he father s work a number of people become involve in the preparation but work be slow until 1937 in that year a grant be obtain from the penrose fund of the geological society of america to finance additional full-time worker money be also advance by the publisher john wiley & son inc volume 1 be complete in 1941 and publish in 1944 the editor of this volume and volume 2 be the late charles palache clifford frondel and the late harry berman all of harvard university work on volume 2 be begin in 1941 interrupt by the war in 1942 and resume in 1945 the volume be complete in 1950 and publish in 1951 a supplementary grant from the geological society of america help finance it publication besides the editor there be many contributor in the unite state and great britain to volume 1 and 2 we ford for example continue to supply data on the occurrence of mineral until he death in 1939 volume 3 be near completion and there be plan to revise volume 1 the project be currently support by harvard university substance mineral property crystallographic physical optical and chemical property the crystallographic data give include interaxial angle and unit cell dimension the physical property value include hardness melt point and specific gravity source of data almost entirely original article in journal abstract and other compilation on rare occasion when original paper be not available criticality all information be carefully appraise and uncertain fact be designate by an authentic diffraction pattern be always obtain and optical property be frequently check use of nomenclature symbol unit physical constant recommendation of international authority such a the international union of crystallography be follow there be a complete synonymy at the begin of each species description currency currency in the usual sense can not be maintain in an undertake of this sort format the data be present in text and table in bind volume volume 1 of the seventh edition contain an introduction and data for eight class of mineral volume 2 contain data for forty-two class reference be give at the end of each mineral description and a general index be give at the end of each volume there will be a comprehensive index in volume 3 cover all three volume publication and distribution volume 1 afj of the seventh edition of dana s system of mineralogy be publish in 1944 and volume 2 afj in 1951 by john wiley & son inc new york n y the association of wiley & son with the dana mineralogy date back to 1844 when they publish the second edition of the system the two volume be available from the publisher for $ 1400 and $ 1600 respectively 2-5 the groth institute organization the groth institute which be establish in 1958 be a group activity affiliate with the physics department of the pennsylvania state university university park pa ray pepinsky be the director the institute derive it name from paul von groth s chemische krystallographie a five-volume work which appear between 1906 and 1919 the resident staff be large and consist of professional assistant graduate student abstractors librarian technical editor machine operator secretarial help and other there be also correspond member and outside advisory group the air force office of scientific research have provide financial assistance in the early stage of the institute s program substance all crystalline substance and other solid-state material property the aim be to collect a very broad range of physical chemical morphological and structural data for crystal on an encyclopedic scale and to seek all possible useful and reveal correlation of property with internal structure source of data the first stage of operation have center on the literature image of critical or summarize tabulation such a the barker index coverage of primary literature will follow unpublished data will be available to the groth institute from cooperate group and individual criticality critical evaluation of all data compile be not a primary aim of this project however the propose correlation of the many interrelate property of crystal will reveal discrepancy in the record data and suggest area for reinvestigation in addition the availability of computer will permit recalculation and refinement of much structural information use of nomenclature symbol unit physical constant for punched-card or tape storage of information all literature value must be conform to a common language in this way a degree of unification of nomenclature symbol and unit will be realize
