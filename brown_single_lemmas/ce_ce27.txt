while feed be put in from the opposite side of the fence by self-unloading wagon 2 mechanize bunk they sit within the feed lot be fill by a mechanical conveyor above feed surface 3 special bunk a discuss here they permit cattle to eat from all side feed be put in with an elevator several material or combination of material can be use to construct a satisfactory feed bunk the selection of material depend on skill of available labor for installation cost of material available locally and you own preference no one material be good for all situation select bunk by economic comparison be usually an individual problem fence-line feed animal eat only from one side so the fence-line bunk must be twice a long a the mechanical bunk these bunk also serve a a fence so part of the additional cost must be attribute to the fence because of they location on the edge of the feed lot fence-line bunk be not in the way of mechanical manure removal fill these bunk by the same self-unloading wagon use to fill silo spread cost of the wagon over more time and operation all-weather road must be provide next to the feed floor so access will be possible all year this will be a problem in area of heavy snowfall
