sales and net income for the year end december 31 1960 show an improvement over 1959 net income be $ 2557111 or $ 311 per share on 821220 common share currently outstanding a compare to $ 2323867 or $ 282 per share in 1959 adjust to the same number of share sales and other operate income increase 251 % from $ 24926615 in 1959 to $ 31179816 in 1960 this increase be sufficient to overcome the effect on net income of high cost of manufacture and increase expenditure on research and development in spite of the fact that we large market the textile industry be affect substantially by the current decline in business activity we have be able to produce and deliver we machine throughout the year 1960 at a rate materially high than during 1959 outlook for current year we current rate of income order have now contract and unless this trend can be reverse we production for 1961 will be low than for 1960 however the healthy inventory position of the textile industry lend support to the broadly express belief that improvement in that industry can be expect by the second half of 1961 need for sound tax policy in connection with we continue development of new and more efficient mill machinery a sound we income tax policy on depreciation of production equipment enable the mill to charge off the cost of new machine on a more realistic basis could if adopt have favorable effect on leesona s business in the next few year such a depreciation policy would also we believe prove a very important factor in strengthen the competitive position of the we textile and other industry thus help to strengthen the position of the dollar in foreign exchange research and development we research and development program serve a it do an industry which must compete against low-cost production throughout the world continue to have primary emphasis at leesona this program be base on the policy of design and build efficient machine which will help produce good textile value fabric whose cost in relation to quality fashion and utility provide the consumer with good textile product for the money such policy involve continue effort to improve on exist mill equipment in term of efficiency and versatility but more important we believe it must concentrate on the development of entirely new concept in textile process a do the unifil loom winder and we more recent uniconer automatic con machine budget increase on this basis we already substantial budget for research and development have be far increase in recent year in order to finance the continue engineering and design work essential to leesona s future growth in sales and earnings much of this necessary increase in research and development though properly chargeable to current expense be not reflect in earnings until project be complete and the new machine sell in quantity usually over a period of several year stretch yarn machine in december we begin to ship we ultra-high-speed stretch yarn machine these machine produce the high quality stretch yarn require in weave stretch and texture fabric during the past year great progress have be make by the weave mill in create new stretch and texture fabric fashion center be now predict broad acceptance of sport apparel and improve wash and wear dress and blouse make from these fabric this machine operate at speed up to 350000 revolution per minute be believe to provide one of the fast mechanical operation in industry today it transfer yarn directly from the producer large package into ideal supply package for use on unifil loom winder in weave stretch yarn fabric large-package twister we new large-package ring twister for glass fiber yarn be perform well in we customer mill late in the year additional type of this leesona twister will be make available to mill for other man-made fibers and natural yarn these machine be design to provide high operate speed large yarn package and great flexibility of application to different type of yarn this we believe will substantially broaden the potential market for the equipment uniconer major activity at providence in 1961 will involve the schedule completion of tool for production of the uniconer automatic con machine this work be progress on schedule and we expect to make initial shipment in the fourth quarter of this year this machine be demonstrate in two textile machinery exhibition last year and be well receive by the industry the potential market for the machine should be comparable to that of the unifil loom winder the uniconer have several outstanding feature it operate with much great efficiency than exist equipment it incorporate an automatic knot-tying device on each spindle and it will knot a break in the yarn in 10 second a well a tie in new bobbin a the run end be exhaust because the bobbin-to-cone wind process be a relatively high-cost operation for the mill the almost complete automation provide by the uniconer can mean important economy in textile production at the same time upgrade quality many mill have already place firm order for this machine new unifil application a new application for the unifil loom winder run single fill for box loom will broaden mill use of this equipment take-up machine a new spin take-up machine have be develop to facilitate the use of we take-up machine in the production of thermoplastic yarn it be equip with electronic control that can be set to hold precise tension and speed this new machine take up filament yarn from spinneret or extruder and wind large package at speed up to 6000 foot per minute it be equip with an automatic thread device to reduce waste and handle time we take-up machine and we twister-coners be undergo important pilot plant test for application with new high polymer yarn in several fiber produce plant we look forward to a strong position in this expand field diversification plan we be interest in far diversification into other field of capital goods or component for industrial product and have recently intensify we effort in that direction patterson moo research we patterson moo research division have make far very encourage progress in development of fuel cell the cooperation of we exclusive american licensee pratt & whitney aircraft division of unite aircraft corporation have be important in this work in addition to it major effort on fuel cell patterson moo research division be continue to carry on research in other field both under contract for the defense department other government agency and for we own account pmr be currently supply component vital to the titan and minuteman program we have recently enter into an agreement with compagnie generale de telegraphie sans fil csf of france for the exclusive exchange of technical information on thermoelectric material the agreement give we right for manufacture and marketing of such material in the unite state initially we will import the thermoelectric material and module from france but late we will manufacture in this country there be a rapidly grow demand for this material primarily from the military far research we believe will develop important commercial application a project for the air force have be complete in which the nair infrared detect device be develop for area monitor of noxious or dangerous gas we be initiate research on the use of solid state material for infrared detection use a method which will not require cool of material to attain high sensitivity the rapid advance in science today suggest many other avenue of investigation we plan be to keep abreast of these advance and select for development those field which seem most promise for we special capability new plant facility early in august we break ground for a new $ 3500000 plant in warwick rhode island which will house we textile and coil wind machinery operation construction be well along and the plant be schedule for completion in november of this year all operation now carry on at we plant at cranston will be transfer to warwick operation in the new plant should be produce efficiently early in 1962 an architect s sketch of the new plant be show on the front cover the build will contain 430000 square foot approximately the same a we present plant however it modern one-story layout be design to increase we production capacity permit more efficient manufacture and substantially reduce current repair and maintenance cost a major consideration in the choice of the warwick site four mile from cranston be the fact that it permit retention of we present train and highly skilled work force we have enter into an agreement for the sale of the present cranston property effective a soon a we have complete removal to we new plant british subsidiary during the year we british subsidiary leesona-holt limit expand it plant in darwen england and add machine tool capacity the operation of it other plant in rochdale and leesona s former operation in manchester be transfer to a recently acquire plant in the adjoin town of heywood layout and equipment be modernize and improve to obtain increase production on an efficient basis the area available at heywood be approximately three time the size of the former rochdale and manchester location in addition land have be purchase to permit double the size of the plant in the future financial development the new warwick plant be be build at we expense and under we direction it will be transfer on completion to the industrial foundation of rhode island a non-profit organization which will reimburse we for the cost of construction we will then occupy the new plant under lease with an option to purchase these arrangement be in we opinion very favorable to leesona interim finance of construction cost be provide by a short term loan from the chase manhattan bank in addition to expenditure on the warwick plant we have invest approximately $ 1961000 for machinery and equipment at cranston and for new machinery plant and equipment at leesona-holt limit we believe that these improve facility will contribute income and effect saving which will fully justify the investment long term loan have be reduce by $ 395000 to $ 2461000 inventory increase $ 625561 to $ 8313514 during the year and should decline in come month thus we enter 1961 in a strong financial position employee contract in accordance with the two-year contract sign in may 1959 with the international association of machinist afl-cio wage of hourly employee be increase by 4 % in may 1960 and pay level for non-exempt salaried employee be increase proportionately in addition blue cross coverage for all employee and they dependent be extend to provide the full cost of semi-private hospital accommodation personnel benefit in addition to direct salary and wage the company pay or accrue during the year the follow amount for the benefit of employee during the pension year end december 31 1960 23 employee retire make a total of 171 currently retire under the company s pension plan at december 13 1960 the fund hold by the industrial national bank of providence a trustee for payment of past and future service pension to qualify member of the plan totale $ 2412616 the basic market for textile be grow with the expansion of the population that begin 20 year ago another growth factor be increase consumer demand for good quality and large quantity of fabric that go with a rise standard of live a in many other industry rise cost and intense competition both domestic and foreign have exert increase pressure on earnings of the textile industry in recent year increase efficiency in textile a elsewhere a major part of the solution lie in great efficiency and high productivity a a designer and manufacturer of textile production machinery leesona and other company in it industry have seek to meet this challenge with new or improve equipment and method that would increase production yet maintain both quality and flexibility problem of shift style the problem of efficient production in textile be complicate by the fact that the industry serve large market which shift quickly with change of fashion in apparel or home decoration production must be adjust accordingly at minimum cost and quickly in addition production machinery must in many case be design to handle with equal efficiency both natural fibers and the increase number of synthetic a well a blend
