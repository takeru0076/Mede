the vast central valley of california be one of the most productive agricultural area in the world during the summer of 1960 it become the set for a bitter and basic labor-management struggle the contestant in this economic struggle be the agricultural worker organize committee awoc of the afl-cio and the agricultural employer of the state by virtue of the legal responsibility of the department of employment in the farm placement program we necessarily find ourselves in the middle between these two force it be not a pleasant or easy position but one we have endeavored to maintain we have seek to be strictly neutral a between the party but at the same time we have be require frequently to rule on specific issue or situation a they arise inevitably one side be please and the other displease regardless of how we rule often the displease party interpret we decision a imply favoritism toward the other we have console ourselves with the think that this be a normal human reaction and be one of the consequence of any decision in an adversary proceed it be disconcert nevertheless to read in a labor weekly perluss knuckle down to grower and then to be confront with a grower publication which state perluss recognize obviously phony and trumped-up strike a bona fide for a number of year there have be sporadic attempt in california to organize farm worker these attempt meet with little sucess for a variety of reason they be inadequately finance without experience leadership and lack the general support of organize labor a a whole this past year the pattern have be different the organize program have the full support of the afl-cio which supply staff and money to the awoc a well a moral support leadership be experience and skillful and financial resource be significant regardless of where personal sympathy may lie a between the party failure to recognize these change condition would be to ignore the fact of life a a result of these change condition the impact of the organizational effort on agricultural labor-management relation have be much great than in the past the awoc have be able to employ the traditional weapon of labor the strike and the picket line with considerable success particularly in the area of wage by the very nature of the situation it be the union which have be able to select the time and place to bring pressure upon management to date at least the strategy of the awoc have be selective that be to say to concentrate on a particular crop or activity in a particular area at a strategic time rather than any broadside engagement with management throughout an area or the state primarily we become involve in these dispute because of we referral obligation under we farm placement program normally because agricultural labor be not cover by unemployment insurance we would not expect any issue to arise regard benefit payment under the trade dispute provision of the unemployment insurance code although such a situation be quite within the realm of possibility but the current issue arise out of the wagner-peyser act concern referral to an establishment where a labor dispute exist and out of public law 78 and the migrant labor agreement if mexican national be employ at the ranch most of we remember and think of the wagner-peyser act in it historical sense a a major milestone in the development of public placement service infrequently do we think of it a a live continue operate control over the system however when labor dispute arise it provision come clearly into play california have accept the provision of that act a have all other state by enact into we code section 2051 a provision that the state of california accept the provision of the wagner-peyser act and will observe and comply with the requirement of that act with respect to labor dispute the wagner-peyser act state only in carry out the provision of this act the secretary be authorize and direct to provide for the give of notice of strike or lock-out to applicant before they be refer to employment other provision of the act empower the secretary to adopt regulation necessary to carry out it provision and he have do so the pertinent regulation for we purpose be section 6022 a follow referral in labor dispute situation no person shall be refer to a position the fill of which will aid directly or indirectly in fill a job which 1 be vacant because the former occupant be on strike or be be lock out in the course of a labor dispute or 2 the fill of which be an issue in a labor dispute with respect to position not cover by subparagraph 1 or 2 of this paragraph any individual may be refer to a place of employment in which a labor dispute exist provide he be give write notice of such dispute prior to or at the time of he referral in analyze this regulation let we take the last sentence first it permit referral under certain circumstance even when there be a labor dispute provide the individual be give write notice of such a dispute assume for example a situation where a farm have a pack shed and field the pack shed worker go on strike there be no dispute involve fieldwork we conclude that we may refer worker to the fieldwork but not the pack shed work provide we give they write notice of the pack shed dispute so far no troublesome case have arise under this provision it be the first part of the regulation that be currently at issue note that it prohibit referral under either condition 1 or condition 2 employer representative have contend that the secretary have go beyond he authority by such a prohibition on the ground that the wagner-peyser act require only write notice to the prospective worker that a dispute exist into court the matter get into the court this way one of the early strike call by the awoc be at the digiorgio pear orchard in yuba county we find that a labor dispute exist and that the worker have leave they job which be then vacant because of the dispute accordingly under clause 1 of the secretary s regulation we suspend referral to the employer incidentally no mexican national be involve the employer seek to continue he harvest challenge we right to cease referral to he and seek relief in the superior court of yuba county the court issue a temporary restrain order direct we to resume referral we of course obey the court order however the attorney general of california at the request of the secretary of labor seek to have the jurisdiction over the issue remove to the federal district court on ground that it be predominantly a federal issue since the validity of the secretary s regulation be be challenge however the federal court hold that since the state have accept the provision of the wagner-peyser act into it own code and presumably therefore also the regulation it be now a state matter it accordingly refuse to assume jurisdiction whereupon the california superior court make the restrain order permanent under that order we have continue refer worker to the ranch a similar case arise at the bower ranch in butte county and the superior court of that county issue similar restrain order the grower have strenuously argue that i should have accept the superior court decision a conclusive and issue statewide instruction to we staff to ignore this provision in the secretary s regulation i can not accept that view either a a lawyer or a an administrator legal consideration first let we examine briefly some of the legal consideration involve it be an accept juridical principle in california that a superior court decision do not constitute a bind legal precedent it be conclusive unless appeal only upon the particular party to the particular action which be hear it be not bind upon another superior court which could rule to the contrary only when a decision be render by the district court of appeal or of course the supreme court be a bind precedent establish in that event we can correctly say that we have receive an authoritative interpretation of the matter and one which we can follow statewide with confidence that the policy will not be overthrow in other superior court but over and beyond the compel need for a bind precedent decision i be convince that the decision of the superior court which in effect nullify the secretary s regulation be not a correct interpretation of the secretary s power under the federal law i believe i be in good company in this view the attorney general of california concur in this interpretation and have file an appeal from these decision to the district court of appeal the attorney general of the unite state in consider the power of the secretary to issue similar regulation under the wagner-peyser act relate to the interstate recruitment of farm worker have render an opinion sustain he authority far and a an evidence of legislative intent only the senate of the unite state recently defeat by a substantial majority the holland amendment to the fair labor standard act which would have specifically limit the regulatory authority of the secretary in these matter next let we consider briefly the program and administrative implication of a failure on we part to pursue we appeal there be far too much at stake for all of the party concern to leave the matter hang in midair the ramification of the issue be enormous a decision to refer worker to job vacant because of a strike would have to be apply equally to nonagricultural situation and might in effect place the public employment service in the position of act a strikebreaker the public interest be so dominant in such an issue that i can not be so presumptuous a to attempt to settle it by an administrative order base upon conclusion reach in a summary action in one or two superior court in the state it be an issue which may well reach the supreme court of the unite state before judicial finality be achieve a an administrator i can not place the employment service in california in jeopardy of be out of compliance with the federal law by i failure to pursue the avenue of appeal open to i to have apply statewide the decision of the two case hear in superior court in i opinion would have place we clearly out of compliance with the wagner-peyser act and would have immediately open the way for the secretary of labor be he so incline to notify the governor of such noncompliance set a date for hear and issue he find the impact of noncompliance under the wagner-peyser act be clear the withdrawal of some $ 11 million a year of administrative fund which finance we employment service program or a a corollary the take over by the federal government of it operation thus far the case which have come before the court have involve only the issue of referral where the job be vacant due to a strike condition 1 in the regulation of the secretary none have yet arise under condition 2 relate to referral to job the fill of which be an issue in a labor dispute here the problem be essentially one of define the word fill should it be define in a narrow sense to include only such element a job specification union membership union jurisdiction and the like or should it have a broad connotation of include wage demand and other factor not necessarily associate with the mechanic of fill the job because of the uncertainty of this definition i solicit the interpretation of the secretary of labor he have advise i that the narrow interpretation be the proper one that be that if wage for example be the only issue in a labor dispute and no worker have leave they job because of the dispute we may continue to make referral
