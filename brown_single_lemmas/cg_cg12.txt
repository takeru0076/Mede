nothing like godot he arrive before the hour he letter have suggest we meet at i hotel at noon on sunday and i come into the lobby a the clock strike twelve he be wait i wish to meet samuel beckett have be prompt by simple curiosity and interest in he work american newspaper reviewer like to call he play nihilistic they find deep pessimism in they even so astute a commentator a harold clurman of the nation have say that wait for godot be the concentrate of the contemporary european mood of despair but to i beckett s write have seem permeate with love for human being and with a kind of humor that i could reconcile neither with despair nor with nihilism could it be that i own eye and ear have deceive i be he a literature of defeat irrelevant to the social crisis we face or be it relevant because it teach we something useful to know about ourselves i know that a conversation with the author would not settle such question because a man be not the same a he write in the last analysis the question have to be settle by the work itself nevertheless i be curious i curiosity be sharpen a day or two before the interview by a conversation i have with a well-informed teacher of literature a jesuit father at a conference on religious drama near paris when beckett s name come into the discussion the priest grow loud and tell i that beckett hate life that i think be at least one thing i can find out when we meet beckett s appearance be rough-hewn irish the feature of he face be distinct but not fine they look a if they have be sculpture with an unsharpened chisel unruly hair go straight up from he forehead stand so high that the top fall gently over a if to show that it really be hair and not bristle one might say it combine the man own pride and humility for he have the pride that come of self-acceptance and the humility perhaps of the same genesis not to impose himself upon another he light blue eye set deep within the face be actively and continually look he seem by some unconscious division of labor to have give they that one function and no other leave communication to the rest of the face the mouth frequently break into a disarm smile the voice be light in timbre with a rough edge that correspond to he visage the irish accent be a one would expect combine with slight inflection from the french he tweed suit be a baggy gray and green he wear a word knit sport shirt with no tie we walk down the rue de larcade thence along beside the madeleine and across to a sidewalk cafe opposite that church the conversation that ensue may have be engross but it could hardly be call world-shattering for one thing the world that beckett see be already shatter he talk turn to what he call the mess or sometimes this buz confusion i reconstruct he sentence from note make immediately after we conversation what appear here be short than what he actually say but very close to he own word the confusion be not i invention we can not listen to a conversation for five minute without be acutely aware of the confusion it be all around we and we only chance now be to let it in the only chance of renovation be to open we eye and see the mess it be not a mess you can make sense of i suggest that one must let it in because it be the truth but beckett do not take to the word truth what be more true than anything else to swim be true and to sink be true one be not more true than the other one can not speak anymore of be one must speak only of the mess when heidegger and sartre speak of a contrast between be and existence they may be right i do nt know but they language be too philosophical for i i be not a philosopher one can only speak of what be in front of he and that now be simply the mess then he begin to speak about the tension in art between the mess and form until recently art have withstand the pressure of chaotic thing it have hold they at bay it realize that to admit they be to jeopardize form how could the mess be admit because it appear to be the very opposite of form and therefore destructive of the very thing that art hold itself to be but now we can keep it out no long because we have come into a time when it invade we experience at every moment it be there and it must be allow in i grant this might be so but find the result to be even more attention to form than be the case previously and why not how i ask could chaos be admit to chaos would not that be the end of think and the end of art if we look at recent art we find it preoccupy with form beckett s own work be an example play more highly formalize than wait for godot endgame and krapp s last tape would be hard to find what i be say do not mean that there will henceforth be no form in art it only mean that there will be new form and that this form will be of such a type that it admit the chaos and do not try to say that the chaos be really something else the form and the chaos remain separate the latter be not reduce to the former that be why the form itself become a preoccupation because it exist a a problem separate from the material it accommodate to find a form that accommodate the mess that be the task of the artist now yet i respond could not similar thing be say about the art of the past be it not characteristic of the great art that it confront we with something we can not clarify demand that the viewer respond to it in he own never-predictable way what be the history of criticism but the history of man attempt to make sense of the manifold element in art that will not allow themselves to be reduce to a single philosophy or a single aesthetic theory be nt all art ambiguous not this he say and gesture toward the madeleine the classical line of the church which napoleon think of a a temple of glory dominate all the scene where we sit the boulevard de la madeleine the boulevard malesherbes and the rue royale run to it with graceful flattery bear tiding of the age of reason not this this be clear this do not allow the mystery to invade we with classical art all be settle but it be different at chartres there be the unexplainable and there art raise question that it do not attempt to answer i ask about the battle between life and death in he play didi and gogo hover on the edge of suicide hamm s world be death and clov may or may not get out of it to join the live child outside be this life-death question a part of the chaos yes if life and death do not both present themselves to we there would be no inscrutability if there be only darkness all would be clear it be because there be not only darkness but also light that we situation become inexplicable take augustine s doctrine of grace give and grace withhold have you ponder the dramatic quality in this theology two thief be crucify with christ one save and the other damn how can we make sense of this division in classical drama such problem do not arise the destiny of racine s phedre be seal from the begin she will proceed into the dark a she go she herself will be illuminate at the begin of the play she have partial illumination and at the end she have complete illumination but there have be no question but that she move toward the dark that be the play within this notion clarity be possible but for we who be neither greek nor jansenist there be not such clarity the question would also be remove if we believe in the contrary total salvation but where we have both dark and light we have also the inexplicable the key word in i play be perhaps give a theological lead i ask what he think about those who find a religious significance to he play well really there be none at all i have no religious feel once i have a religious emotion it be at i first communion no more i mother be deeply religious so be i brother he kneel down at he bed a long a he could kneel i father have none the family be protestant but for i it be only irksome and i let it go i brother and mother get no value from they religion when they die at the moment of crisis it have no more depth than an old school tie irish catholicism be not attractive but it be deep when you pass a church on an irish bus all the hand flurry in the sign of the cross one day the dog of ireland will do that too and perhaps also the pig but do the play deal with the same facet of experience religion must also deal with yes for they deal with distress some people object to this in i write at a party an english intellectual so-called ask i why i write always about distress a if it be perverse to do so he want to know if i father have beat i or i mother have run away from home to give i an unhappy childhood i tell he no that i have have a very happy childhood then he think i more perverse than ever i leave the party a soon a possible and get into a taxi on the glass partition between i and the driver be three sign one ask for help for the blind another help for orphan and the third for relief for the war refugee one do not have to look for distress it be scream at you even in the taxi of london lunch be over and we walk back to the hotel with the light and dark of paris scream at we the personal quality of samuel beckett be similar to quality i have find in the play he say nothing that compress experience within a close pattern perhaps stand in place of commitment at the same time he be plainly sympathetic clearly friendly if there be only the mess all would be clear but there be also compassion a a christian i know i do not stand where beckett stand but i do see much of what he see a a writer on the theater i have pay close attention to the play harold clurman be right to say that wait for godot be a reflection he call it a distort reflection of the impasse and disarray of europe s present politics ethic and common way of life yet it be not only europe the play refer to wait for godot sell even good in america than in france the consciousness it mirror may have come early to europe than to america but it be the consciousness that most mature society arrive at when they success in technological and economic systematization propel they into a time of examine the not-strictly-practical end of culture america be now join europe in this mature phase of development whether any of we remain in it long will depend on what happen a a result of the technological and economic revolution now go on in the country of asia and africa and also of course on how long the cold war remain cold
