whenever artist indeed turn to actual representation or mold three-dimensional figure which be rare down to 800 bc they tend to reflect reality see plate 6a 9b a schematic abstract treatment of man and animal by intent rise only in the late eighth century to speak of this underlie view of the world be to embark upon matter of subjective judgment at the least however one may conclude that geometric potter sense a logical order they principle of composition stand very close to those which appear in the homeric epic and the hexameter line they world again be a still simple traditional age which be only slowly begin to appreciate the complexity of life and perhaps an observer of the vase will not go too far in deduce that the outlook of they maker and user be basically stable and secure the storm of the past have die away and the great upheaval which be to mark the follow century have not yet begin to disturb man s mind throughout the work of the late ninth century a calm severe serenity display itself in the vase this spirit may perhaps at time bear or repel one in it internal self-satisfaction but the good of the geometric pin have rightly be consider among the most beautiful ever make in the greek world the ninth century be in it artistic work the spiritually free and most self-sufficient between past and future and the love skill spend by it artist upon they product be a testimonial to they sense that what they be do be important and be appreciate the aegean in 800 bc geometric pottery have not yet receive the thorough detail study which it deserve partly because the task be a mammoth one and partly because some of it local manifestation a at argos be only now come to light from even a cursory inspection of it many aspect however the historian can deduce several fundamental conclusion about the progress of the aegean world down to 800 bc the general intellectual outlook which have appear in the eleventh century be now consolidate to a significant degree much which be in embryo in 1000 have become reasonably well develop by 800 in this process the minoan-mycenaean inheritance have be transmute or finally reject the aegean world which have exist before 1000 differ from that which rise more clearly in we vision after 800 those modern scholar who urge that we must keep in mind the fundamental continuity of aegean development from early time grant occasional irruption of people and idea from outside be correct but all too many observer have be mislead by this fact into minimize the degree of change which take place in the early first millennium the focus of novelty in this world now lie in the south-eastern district of the greek mainland and by 800 virtually the entire aegean always except it northern shore have accept the geometric style of pottery while protogeometric vase usually turn up especially outside greece proper together with a many or more example of local stamp these non-greek pattern have mostly vanish by the late ninth century in they place come local variation within the common style tentative a it be in protogeometric product but truly distinct and sharply define a the geometric spirit develop attica though important be not the only teacher of this age one can take a vase of about 800 bc and without any knowledge of it place of origin venture to assign it to a specific area imitation and borrow of motif now become ascertainable the potter of the aegean island thus stand apart from those of the mainland and in greece itself argive corinthian attic boeotian and other geometric sequence have each they own hallmark these local variation be to become ever sharpe in the next century and a half the same conclusion can be draw from the other physical evidence of the dark age from linguistic distribution and from the survival of early social political and religious pattern into late age by 800 bc the aegean be an area of common tongue and of common culture on these pillar rest that solid basis for life and think which be soon to be manifest in the remarkably unlimited ken of the iliad everywhere within the common pattern however one find local diversity greek history and culture be enduringly fertilize and plague by the interplay of these conjoin yet oppose factor far we can not go for the dark age deserve they name many aspect of civilization be not yet sufficiently crystallize to find expression nor could the simple economic and social foundation of this world support a lofty structure the epic poem the consolidation of the greek pantheon the rise of firm political unit the self-awareness which could permit paint and sculpture representation of man all these have to await the progress of follow decade what we have see in this chapter we have see only dimly and yet the result however general be worth the search these be the century in which the inhabitant of the aegean world settle firmly into they mind and into they institution the foundation of the hellenic outlook independent of outside force to interpret indeed the era from 1000 to 800 a a period mainly of consolidation may be a necessary but unfortunate defect bear of we lack of detail information if we could see more deeply we probably would find many side issue and wrong turning which come to an end within the period the historian can only point out those line which be major enough to find reflection in we limit evidence and must hope that future excavation will enrich we understand throughout the dark age it be clear the greek world have be develop slowly but consistently the pace could now be accelerate for the inhabitant of the aegean stand on firm ground chapter 5 the early eighth century the landscape of greek history broaden widely and rather abruptly in the eighth century bc the age of homer s rosy-fingered dawn the first slant ray of the new day can not yet dispel all the dark shadow which lie across the aegean world but we evidence grow considerably in variety and show more unmistakably some of the line of change for this period a for early century pottery remain the most secure source the ceramic material of the age be more abundant more diversify and more indicative of the hope and fear of it maker who begin to show scene of human life and death figurine and simple chapel presage the emergence of sculpture and architecture in greece object in gold ivory and bronze grow more numerous since write be practice in the aegean before the end of the century we may hope that the detail of tradition will now be occasionally useful though it be not easy to apply the evidence of the iliad to any specific era this marvelous product of the epic tradition have certainly take definitive shape by 750 the dipylon geometric pottery of athens and the iliad be amaze manifestation of the inherent potentiality of greek civilization but both be among the last product of a phase which be end greek civilization be swirl toward it great revolution in which the develop quality of the hellenic outlook be suddenly to break forth the revolution be well under way before 700 bc and premonitory sign go back virtually across the century the era however be janus-faced while many token point forward the main achievement stand a a culmination of the simple pattern of the dark age the dominant pottery of the century be geometric political organization revolve about the basileis trade be just begin to expand the god who protect the greek countryside be only now put on they sharply anthropomorphic dress the modern student who know what be to come next be likely to place first the factor of change which be visible in the eighth century not all man of the period would have accept this emphasis many potter cling to the past the more determinedly a they be confront with radically new idea the poet of the iliad deliberately archaized although it be not possible to sunder old and new in this era i shall consider in the present chapter primarily the first decade of the eighth century and shall interpret they a an apogee of the first stage of greek civilization on this principle of division i must postpone the evolution of sculpture architecture society and politics for the development in these area make sense only if they be connect to the age of revolution itself the grow contact between aegean and orient be also a phase which should be link primarily to the remarkable broaden of hellenic culture after 750 we shall not be able entirely to pass over these connection to the east a we consider ripe geometric pottery the epic and the myth and the religious evolution of early greece the important point however be that these magnificent achievement unlike those of late decade be only incidentally influence by oriental model the antecedent of dipylon vase and of the iliad lie in the aegean past dipylon pottery the pottery of the first half of the eighth century be commonly call ripe geometric the severe yet harmonious vase of the previous fifty year the strong geometric style of the late ninth century display a firm a mastery of the principle underlie geometric pottery but artist now be ready to refine and elaborate they inheritance the vase which result have different shape far more complex decoration and a large sense of style beyond the aesthetic and technical aspect of this expansion we must consider the change in pottery style on broad line in early century man have have enough to do in rebuild a fundamental sense of order after chaos they have have to work on very simple foundation and have not dare to give rein to impulse the potter in particular have virtually eschew freehand draw elaborate motif and the curve line of nature while yet express a belief that there be order in the universe in they vase be embody the basic aesthetic and logical characteristic of greek civilization at first hesitantly in protogeometric work and then more confidently in the initial stage of the geometric style by 800 social and cultural security have be achieve at least on a simple plane it be time to take big step to venture on experiment ripe geometric potter continue to employ the old syntax of ornament and shape and make use of the well-defined though limit range of motif which they have inherit in these respect the vase of the early eighth century represent a culmination of early line of progress to the ancestral lore however new material be add painter leave less and less of a vase in a plain dark color instead they divide the surface into many band or cover it by all-over pattern into which freehand draw begin to creep wavy line feather-like pattern rosette of indefinitely floral nature bird either singly or in stylized row animal in solemn frieze band see plate 11 - 12 all these turn up in the more develop fabric a preliminary sign that the potter be broaden they gaze the row of animal and bird in particular suggest awareness of oriental animal frieze transmit perhaps via syrian silver bowl and textile but the specific form of these row on local vase and metal product be nonetheless greek though the spread of this type of decoration in the aegean have not yet be precisely determine it seem to appear first in the cyclades which be among the lead exporter of pottery throughout the century a the material at the command of the potter grow and the volume of they production increase the local variation within a common style become more evident plate 12 illustrate four example which be ripe or late geometric work of common spirit but of different school
