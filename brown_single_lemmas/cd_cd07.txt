care of themselves only 8 % of the worry have behind they real cause which demand attention well most of we fear may be unfounded but after you discover that fact you have something else to worry about why then do we have these fear what be the real cause of they what be there about we that make we so anxious look at the thing we do to escape we fear and to forget we worry we spend millions of dollar every year on fortune teller and soothsayer we spend billions of dollar at the race track and more billions on other form of gamble we spend billions of dollar on liquor and many more billions on various form of escapist entertainment we consume ton of aspirin and tranquilizers and sleep pill in order to get a moment s relief from the tension that be tear we apart a visitor from a more peaceful country across the sea be take to one of we amusement park and after he have see it all he say to a friend you must be a very sad people sad be not the right word of course he should have say jittery for that s what we be and that s bad than sad watch people flock to amusement house cocktail lounge and night club that advertise continuous entertainment which mean an endless flow of noise and frivolity by pay entertainer who be suppose to perform in those incredible way which be design to give man a few hour of dubious relaxation watch they and you can tell that many of they be run away from something in one of he writing pascal speak of this mania for diversion a be a sign of misery and fear which man can not endure without such opiate yes and a tension mount in this world fear be increase do that explain why there be now such a big boom in the bomb shelter business we have so many new thing to fear in this age of nuclear weapon dreadful thing which be too horrible to contemplate i doubt that fear party and group confessional will help very much suppose we do get we fear out in the open what then be nt that where most of they be already right out on the front page of we newspaper maybe we be talk about they too much the question be what be we go to do about they meanwhile the enemy will capitalize on we fear if he can hitler do just that 23 year ago build up tension that first lead to a munich and then to a world war the fear of war can make we either too weak to stand and too will to compromise or too reckless and too nervous to negotiate for peace a long a there be any chance to negotiate it be say that fear in human being produce an odor that provoke animal to attack it could have the same effect on communist the president of the unite state have say we will never negotiate out of fear and we will never fear to negotiate that be a sound position but it be important that moscow shall recognize it not merely a the word of a president but a the mind of a free people who be not afraid and that s another reason why it be imperative for we these day to conquer we fear to develop the poise that promote peace turn to the word of god we find the only sure way to do that in psalm 27 1 you read those beautiful word which you must have in you heart if you be to master the fear that surround you or to drive they out if they have you in they grip the lord be i light and i salvation whom shall i fear the lord be the strength of i life of whom shall i be afraid well you say those be beautiful word all right but it be easy for the psalmist to sing they in he day he do nt live in a world of perpetual peril like ours he do nt know anything about the problem we face today no read the next two verse when the wicked even i enemy and i foe come upon i to eat up i flesh they stumble and fall though an host should encamp against i i heart shall not fear though war should rise against i in this will i be confident that be almost a perfect description of the predicament in which we find ourselves today be nt it we enemy be also threaten to devour we he have already devour huge area of the world put man behind concrete wall and iron curtain and barbed wire reduce they to slavery systematically crush not only they body but they soul and shoot they to death if they try to escape they prison yes indeed we too can see a warlike host of infidel encamp against we what a terrible thing that wail wall in berlin a man with a baby in he arm stand there plead for he wife who be on the other side with the rest of the family another man try to swim across the river from the east to the west but be shoot and kill a middle age woman open a window on the third floor of she house which be behind the wall she throw out a few belongings and then jump she be fatally injure the entrance to a church have be wall up so that the congregation most of which be in the western sector can not worship god there anymore practically everybody in berlin have relative and friend that live in the opposite part of the city people stand at the wall give vent to they feeling weep pound it with they fist plead for love one but the enemy answer they from loudspeaker that pour out communist propaganda with a generous mixture of terrible profanity there be only one escape leave a tragic one and too many people be take it suicide the normal rate of suicide in east berlin be one a day but since the border be close on august 13 it have jump to 25 a day these thing may be happen many mile away from we but really they be right next door we be all involve in they deeply involve and nobody know what come next we live from crisis to crisis and there be only one way for a man to conquer he fear in such a world he must learn to say with true faith what the psalmist say in a similar world the lord be i light and i salvation whom shall i fear the lord be the strength of i life of whom shall i be afraid notice that this man have a threefold conception of god which be the secret of he faith first the lord be i light he live in a very dark world but he be not in the dark the same god who call this world into be when he say let there be light those be he very first creative word he begin the world with light this god still give light to a world which man have plunge into darkness for those who put they trust in he he still say every day again let there be light and there be light in fact he come into this world himself in the person of he son jesus christ who stand here amid the darkness of human sin and say i be the light of the world he that followeth i shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life the psalmist could say that god be he light even though he could only anticipate the come of christ he live in the dawn he could only see the light come over the horizon we live in the bright daylight of that great event for we it be a fact in history why should we not have the same faith and an even great experience of the light which it give this be the faith that move the psalmist to add he second conception of god the lord be i salvation he know that he god would save he from he enemy because he have save he from he sin if god could do that he could do anything the enemy at he gate threaten to eat up he flesh be nothing compare with the enemy of sin within he own soul and god have conquer that one by he grace so why worry about all the other the apostle paul say the same thing in the language and faith of the new testament he that spare not he own son but deliver he up for we all how shall he not with he freely give we all thing if god be for we who can be against we who shall separate we from the love of christ shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword roman 31 32 35 salvation this be the key to the conquest of fear this get down to the heart of we problem for it reconcile we with god whom we fear most of all because we have sin against he when that fear have be remove by faith in jesus christ when we know that he be we savior that he have pay we debt with he blood that he have meet the demand of god s justice and thus have turn he wrath away when we know that we have peace with god in we heart and then with this god on we side we can face the whole world without fear and so the psalmist give we one more picture of god the lord be the strength of i life the word be really stronghold it recall those word of another psalm god be we refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will not we fear though the earth be remove and though the mountain be carry into the midst of the sea come behold the work of the lord what desolation he hath make in the earth
