the bronchus and pulmonary artery in this lung type maintain a close relationship throughout the pulmonary vein however without the limit supportive tissue septa a in type 1 follow a more direct path to the hilum and do not maintain this close relationship fig 8 22 another mark difference be note here the pulmonary artery in addition to supply the distal portion of the respiratory bronchiole the alveolar duct and the alveoli continue on and directly supply the thin pleura fig 8 the bronchial artery except for a small number of short branch in the hilum contribute none of the pleural blood supply it do a in type 1 supply the hilar lymph node the pulmonary artery the pulmonary vein the bronchi and the bronchioles terminate in a common capillary bed with the pulmonary artery at the level of the respiratory bronchiole no bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomose be note in this group lung type 3 fig 3 be to some degree a composite of type 1 and 2 it be characterize by the presence of incompletely develop secondary lobule well define but haphazardly arrange interlobular septa and a thick remarkably vascular pleura fig 9 the most distal airway be similar to those find in type 1 be compose of numerous apparently true terminal bronchioles and occasional poorly develop respiratory bronchioles fig 14 15 in this instance because of incomplete septation the secondary lobule do not constitute in itself what appear to be a small individual lung a in type 1 air-drifts from one area to another be therefore conceivable distally the bronchus be situate between a pulmonary artery on one side and a pulmonary vein on the other a in type 1 fig 24 this relationship however be not maintain centrally here the pulmonary vein a in type 2 be note to draw away from the bronchus and to follow a more direct independent course to the hilum fig 23 24 the bronchial artery in it course and distribution differ somewhat from that find in other mammal a see in type 1 and 2 it supply the hilar lymph node vasa vasorum to the pulmonary artery and vein the bronchi and the terminal bronchioles a in type 1 it provide arterial blood to the interlobular septa and an extremely rich anastomotic pleural supply be see fig 9 10 this pleural supply be derive both from hilar and interlobular bronchial artery branch such a dual derivation be strikingly demonstrate during the injection process where initial fill would be note to occur in several isolate pleural vessel at once some of these be obviously fill from interlobular branch of the bronchial artery while other be fill from direct hilar branch follow along the pleural surface with completion of fill net-like anastomose be note to be present between these separately derive branch an unusual increase in the number of bronchial artery present within the substance of the lung be note this be account for primarily by the presence of a bronchial artery closely follow the pulmonary artery the diameter of this bronchial artery be much too large for it to be a mere vasa vasorum fig 16 23 24 in distal region it diameter would be one-fourth to one-fifth that of the pulmonary artery this vessel could be follow to the parenchyma where it directly provide bronchial arterial blood to the alveolar capillary bed fig 17 18 also three other direct pathway of alveolar bronchial arterial supply be note via the pleura through the interlobular septa and along the terminal bronchiole fig 14 17 18 19 one bronchial arteriolar-pulmonary arteriolar anastomosis be note at the terminal bronchiolar level fig 26 discussion it be evident that many mark and strike difference exist between lung when an inter-species comparison be make the significance of these difference have not be study nor have the existence of correspond physiologic difference be determine however the dynamics of airflow from morphologic consideration alone may conceivably be different in the monkey than in the horse the volume and perhaps even the characteristic of bronchial arterial blood flow might be different in the dog than in the horse also interlobular air drift may be all but nonexistent in the cow probably occur in the horse much a in the human be and in contrast be present to a relatively immense degree on a segmental basis in the dog where lobule be absent van allen and lindskog 31 a reason for such wide variation in the pulmonary morphology be entirely lack at present within certain wide limit anatomy dictate function and if one be permit to speculate potential pathology should be include in this statement a well for example the mark susceptibility of the monkey to respiratory infection might be relate to it delicate long alveolar duct and short large bronchioles situate within a parenchyma entirely lack in protective supportive tissue barrier such a those find in type 1 and 3 one might also wonder if monkey be capable of develop bronchiolitis a we know it in man or the horse in addition it would be difficult to imagine chronic generalize emphysema occur in a cow consider it mark lobular development but conversely not difficult to imagine this occur in the horse or the dog anatomically the horse lung appear to be remarkably like that of man insofar a this can be ascertain from comparison of we finding in the horse with those of other birnbaum 54 in the human be the only area in which one might find major disagreement in this matter be in regard to the alveolar distribution of the bronchial artery a early a 1858 le fort claim an alveolar distribution of the bronchial artery in human being in 1951 this be reaffirm by cudkowicz the opposition to this point of view have it staunch support in the work of miller 50 apparently however miller have rely heavily on the anatomy in dog and cat and he have be criticize for use pathologic human material in he normal study loosli 38 although miller note in 1907 that a difference in the pleural blood supply exist between animal nowhere in he publish work be it find that he do a comparative study of the intrapulmonary feature of various mammalian lung other than in the dog and cat miller 13 25 the mean of this variation in distribution of the bronchial artery a find in the horse be not clear however this artery be know to be a nutrient vessel with a distribution primarily to the proximal airway and supportive tissue of the lung the alveoli and respiratory bronchioles be primarily diffuse tissue theoretically they be capable of extract they require oxygen either from the surround air ghoreyeb and karsner 13 or from pulmonary arterial blood comroe 58 therefore an explanation of this alveolar bronchial artery supply might be the nutritive requirement of an increase amount of supportive tissue not primarily diffuse in nature in the region of the alveolus if this be true the possibility exist that an occlusive lesion of the bronchial artery might cause widespread degeneration of supportive tissue similar to that see in generalize emphysema one would not expect such an event to occur in animal possess lung of type 1 or 2 the presence of normally occur bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomose be first note in 1721 by ruysch and thereafter by many other nakamura 58 verloop 48 marchand gilroy and watson 50 von hayek 53 and tobin 52 have all claim they normal but relatively nonfunctional existence in the human be miller 50 be the principal antagonist of this viewpoint in criticism of the latter s view he conclusion be base upon dog lung injection study in which all of the vascular channel be first fill with a solution under pressure and then be inject with various size colore particle design to stop at the arteriolar level a early a 1913 ghoreyeb and karsner demonstrate with perfusion study in dog that bronchial artery flow would remain constant at a certain low level when pressure be maintain in the pulmonary artery and vein but that increase in bronchial artery flow would occur in response to a relative drop in pulmonary artery pressure berry brailsford and daly in 1931 and nakamura in 1958 reaffirm this we own study in which bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomose be demonstrate be accomplish by inject the bronchial artery first with no pressure on the pulmonary artery or vein and then by inject the pulmonary artery and vein afterwards it be distinctly possible therefore that simultaneous pressure in all three vessel would have render the shunt inoperable and hence uninjectable this viewpoint be far support by verloop s 48 demonstration of thicken bronchial artery and arteriolar muscular coat which be capable of act a valve in other word the anastomose between the bronchial artery and pulmonary artery should be consider a functional or demand shunt in addition little work have be do on a comparative basis in regard to the normal existence of bronchial artery-pulmonary artery anastomose verloop 48 49 find these shunt in the human be but be unable to find they in rat ellis grindlay and edwards 52 also be unable to find they in rat nakamura 58 be unable to demonstrate they existence either by anatomic or physiologic method in dog the possibility that the absence or presence of these shunt be species-dependent be therefore infer certainly the mere fact of fail to demonstrate they in one or another species do not conclusively deny they existence in that species it be however highly suggestive and agree well with we own finding in which we also fail to demonstrate normally occur bronchial artery-pulmonary artery shunt in certain species especially the dog in conclusion these finding suggest the need for a comparative physiology pathology and histology of mammalian lung in addition a detail interspecies survey of the incidence of generalize pulmonary emphysema in mammal would be interest and pertinent also for the present great caution should be exercise in the choice of an experimental animal for pulmonary study if they be to be apply to man this be especially so if the dog cat or monkey be to be use in view of they mark anatomical difference from man finally it be suggest that in many respect the horse lung may be anatomically more comparable to that of the human than any other presently know species summary the main subgross anatomical feature of the lung of various mammal be present a tabulation of these feature permit the lung to be group into three distinctive subgross type type 1 be represent by the cow sheep and pig type 2 by the dog cat and monkey type 3 by the horse lobularity be extremely well develop in type 1 absent in type 2 imperfectly develop in type 3 the pleura and interlobular septa be thick in type 1 and 3 the pleura be extremely thin in type 2 and septa be absent arterial supply to the pleura in type 1 and 3 be provide by the bronchial artery and in type 2 by the pulmonary artery in type 1 2 and 3 the bronchial artery terminate in a capillary bed share in common with the pulmonary artery at the level of the distal bronchiole in type 3 the bronchial artery also provide blood directly to the alveolar capillary bed true terminal bronchioles comprise the most frequent form take by the distal airway in type 1 and 3 although small number of poorly develop respiratory bronchioles be present well develop respiratory bronchioles on the other hand appear to be the only form take by the distal airway in type 2 in type 1 the pulmonary vein closely follow the course of the bronchus and the pulmonary artery from the periphery to the hilum this may be due to the heavy interlobular connective tissue barrier present in type 3 this general relationship be maintain peripherally but not centrally where the pulmonary vein follow a more independent path to the hilum a be the case throughout the lung in type 2
