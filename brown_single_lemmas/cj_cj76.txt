within only a few year foam plastic material have manage to grow into an integral and important phase of the plastic industry and the end be still not yet in sight urethane foam a only one example be only introduce commercially in this country in 1955 yet last year s volume probably top 100 million lb and expectation be for a market of 275 million lb by 1964 many of the other foam plastic particularly the styrenes show similar growth potential and there be even new foam plastic that be yet to be evaluate a this issue go to press for example one manufacturer have announce an epoxy foam with outstanding buoyancy and impact strength another report that a cellular polypropylene primarily for use in wire coat application be be investigate on the follow page each of the major commercial foam plastic be describe in detail a to property application and method of process it might be well to point out however some of the new development that have take place within the past few month which might have a bear on the future of the various foam plastic involve in urethane foam for example there have be a definite trend toward the polyether-type material which be now available in two-component rigid foam system and the emphasis be definitely on one-shot molding most manufacturer also seem to be concentrate on formulate fire-resistant or self-extinguishing grade of urethane foam that be aim specifically at the burgeon build market urethane foam a an insulator be also come in for a good deal of attention in one outstanding example whirlpool corp find that by switch to urethane foam insulation they could increase the storage capacity of gas refrigerator to make they competitive with electric model much interest have also be express in new technique for process the urethane foam include spray froth and molding see article p 391 for detail and in meet the demand for urethane foam a a garment interlining new adhesive and new method of laminate foam to a substrate have be develop new technique for automatic molding of expandable styrene bead have help boost that particular material into a number of new consumer application include picnic chest beverage cooler flower pot and flotation-type swim toy two other end-use area which contribute to expandable styrene s growth during the year be package mold insert replace complicate cardboard unit and foamed-core build panel extrude expandable styrene film or sheet claim to be competitive price-wise with paper also show much potential particularly for package sandwich panel for build utility shelter that consist of kraft paper skin and rigid styrene foam core also arouse interest in the construction field in vinyl foam the big news be the development of technique for coat fabric with the material for detail see p 395 good hand a more luxurious feel and good insulate property be claim to be the result several company also see possibility in use the technique for extrude or molding vinyl product with a slight cellular core that would reduce cost yet would not affect physical property of the end product to any great extent reader interest in additional information on foam be refer to the foam plastic chart appear in the technical data section and to the list of reference which appear below urethane foam since the mid 1950s when urethane foam first make it appearance in the american market growth have be little short of fantastic present estimate be that production top the 100-million-lb mark in 1960 85 to 90 million lb for flexible 10 or 11 million lb for rigid by 1965 production may range from 200 to 350 million lb for flexible and from 115 to 150 million lb for rigid the market that have start to open up for the foam in the past year or so seem to justify the expectation furniture upholstery a just one example can easily take millions of pound foam refrigerator insulation be under intensive evaluation by every major manufacturer and use of the foam for garment interlining be only now get off the ground with volume potential in the offing basic chemistry urethane foam be basically reaction product of hydroxyl-rich material and polyisocyanates usually tolylene diisocyanate blow can be either one of two type carbon dioxide gas generate by the reaction of water on the polyisocyanate or mechanical blow through the use of a low-boiling liquid such a a fluorinated hydrocarbon the most important factor in determine what property the end-product will have be quite naturally the type of hydroxyl-rich compound that be use in it production originally the main type use be various composition of polyester these be still in wide use today particularly in semi-rigid formulation for such application a core for sandwich-type structural panel foamed-in-place insulation automotive safety pad arm rest etc more recently polyether again in vary composition molecular weight and branch have come into use at first for the flexible foam just lately for the rigids the polyether glycol be claim to give flexible urethane a spring-back action which be much desire in cushion although the first polyether foam on the market have to be produce by the two-step prepolymer method today thank to new catalyst they can be produce by a one-shot technique it be possible that the polyether foam may soon be mold on a production basis in low-cost mold with more intricate contour and with superior property to latex foam the polyester urethane foam be generally produce with adipic acid polyester the polyether group generally consist of foam produce with polypropylene glycol or polypropylene glycol modify with a triol one shoot vs prepolymer in the prepolymer system the isocyanate and resin be mix anhydrously and no foam occur the foam can be accomplish at some future time at a different location by the addition of the correct proportion of catalyst in solution in one-shot the isocyanate polyester or polyether resin catalyst and other additive be mix directly and a foam be produce immediately basically this mean that simple process equipment the mixture have good flow characteristic and less external heat the foam reaction be exothermic and develop internal heat be require in one-shot foam although at the same time the problem of control the condition of one-shot foam be critical one property most commercial use of urethane foam require density between 2 and 30 lb cu ft for rigid foam between 1 and 3 lb cu ft for flexible foam this latter figure compare with latex foam rubber at an average of 55 lb cu ft in commercial grade compression strength graph in fig 1 p 392 indicate how the ratio of compressive strength to density vary a the latter be increase or decrease the single curve line represent a specific formulation in a test example by vary the formula this curve may be move forward or backward along the coordinate to produce any desire compression strength density ratio thermal conductivity and temperature resistance in flexible urethane foam we be refer to the range between the high and low temperature under which the material primary performance remain functionally useful in temperature resistance this quality be usually relate to specific property eg flexural tensile strength etc thermal conductivity be directly traceable to the material s porous air-cell construction which effectively trap air or a gas in the maze of minute bubble which form it composition these air or gas bubble make highly functional thermal barrier the k factor a term use to denote the rate of heat transmission through a material btu ft of material0f of thickness range from 024 to 028 for flexible urethane foam and from 012 to 016 for rigid urethane foam depend upon the formulation density cell size and nature of blow agent use table 1 p 394 show a comparison of k factor rating of a number of commercial insulate material in common use include two different type of rigid urethane foam flexural strength this term refer to the ability of a material to resist bend stress and be determine by measure the load require to cause failure by bend the higher-density urethane semi-rigid foam usually have strong flex fatigue resistance ie the 12 lb cu ft foam have 8 time the flexural strength of the 3 lb cu ft density note that flexural strength be not always improve by simply increase the density nor be the change always proportional from one formulation to another where flexural strength be an important factor be sure that you urethane foam processor be aware of it tensile strength this property refer to the great longitudinal stress or tension a material can endure without tear apart like compression strength of urethane foam it have a direct relationship to formulation exceptional tensile strength be another of urethane foam s strong feature figure 2 above show the age property of urethane foam a determine by the percent of change in tensile strength during exposure to ultra-violet light process urethane there be many way of produce a foam urethane product the foam can be make into slab stock and cut to shape it can be mold it can be poured-in-place it can be apply by spray gun etc slab stock be still one of the most important form of urethane end-product in use today basically the foam machine that produce such stock consist of two or more pump unit a variable mixer a nozzle carriage assembly and in many case a conveyor belt to transport and contain the liquid during the reaction process and until it solidify into foam the ingredient be feed from tank through a hose and into the mixer at a predetermine rate the mix head move back and forth slowly across the width of the receptacle it only take a few minute for the foam action to be complete and after a short cure the material can be cut into length a desire much have be do in the way of ingenious slitters to fabricate the slab stock into finish product profile cut machine be available which can split foam to any desire thickness and produce sine triangle trapezoid and other profile in variable height dimension etc the convolute sheet can be combine to attain certain cushion effect mechanically rather than chemically also available be a slitter which peel the inside of a fold block of foam and can be use to slit continuous sheet up to 300 yd in length down to 116 in thick the low cost and ease of fabrication of the die for three-dimensional foam cut plus the wide variety of shape dimension and contour that can be tailor-made to customer requirement have make the technique useful for produce case liner material handle container package and cushion device and such novelty a soap dish toy head rest arch support and gas pedal cover molding although slab stock appear first it soon become apparent that for the production of cushion with irregular shape crown contour or round edge the cut of slab stock be a wasteful and uneconomical process only by resort to molding technique can the cushion manufacturer hope to compete satisfactorily in the establish cushion market the close molding of flexible urethane foam have be a problem ever since the introduction of the material molding in open mold be more feasible satisfactory method for polyester foam and even prepolymer polyether foam be never fully achieve close molding generally result in part weigh more because of high density than part fabricate from free-blown foam this counteract the gain from have no scrap loss in addition there be difficulty with the flow and spread of the foam mixture over the mold surface trouble with lack of gel strength in the rise foam and problem of split the introduction of one-shot polyether foam system aid by the development of new catalyst help to alleviate some of the problem of close molding while there be still many bug to be iron out the technique be fast develop other technique simple system be available that make it possible for urethane foam component to be pour pump etc into a void where they foam up to fill the void in a typical application the make of rigid urethane foam sandwich panel an amount of foam mixture calculate to expand 10 to 20 % more than the volume of the panel be pour into the panel void and the top of the panel be lock in place by a jig
