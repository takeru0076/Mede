important a be mr odonnells essay he thesis be so restrict a to deny faulkner the stature which he obviously have he and also mr cowley and mr warren have fall to the temptation which beset many of we to read into we author nathaniel hawthorne for example and herman melville protest against modernism material progress and science which be genuine protest of we own but may not have be theirs faulkner s total work today and in fact those of he work which exist in 1946 when mr cowley make he comment or in 1939 when mr odonnell write he essay reveal no such simple attitude toward the south if he be a traditionalist he be an eclectic traditionalist if he condemn the recent or the present he condemn the past with no less force if he see the heroic in a sartoris or a sutpen he see also and he show the blind and the mean and he see the compson family disintegrate from within if the barn-burner s family produce a flem snopes who personify commercialism and materialism in hyperbolic crassness the compson family produce a jason compson 4 faulkner be a most untraditional traditionalist other write on faulkner have find the phrase traditional moralist either inadequate or mislead among they be frederick j hoffman william van oconnor and mrs olga vickery they have indicate the direction but they have not be explicit enough i believe in point out faulkner s independence he question if not indeed challenge the southern tradition faulkner s be not the mind of the apologist which mr odonnell imply that it be he be not one to remain more comfortably and unquestioningly within a body of social cultural or literary tradition than he be within the tradition or possibly the regulation govern he tenure in the post office at oxford mississippi thirty-five year ago that be not to deny that he have be aware of tradition of course that he be steep in they in fact or that he have deal with they in he book it be to say rather i believe that he have bring to bear on the history the tradition and the lore of he region a critical skeptical mind the same mind which have make of he an inveterate experimenter in literary form and technique he have employ from he section rich immediate material which in a loose sense can be term southern the fact that he have cast over those material the light of a skeptical mind do not make he any the less southern i rather think for the south have be no more solid than other region except in the political and relate area where patronage and force and intimidation and fear may produce a surface uniformity some of we might be incline to argue in fact that an independence of mind and action and an intolerance of regimentation either mental or physical be particularly southern trait there be no necessity i suppose to assert that mr faulkner be southern it would not be easy to discover a more thoroughly southern pedigree than that of he family and after all he have live comfortably at both oxford mississippi and charlottesville virginia the young william faulkner in new orleans in the 1920 s impress the novelist hamilton basso a obviously conscious of be a southerner and there be no evidence that since then he have ever consider himself any less so besides show no inclination apparently to absent himself from he native region even for short period and in addition write a shelf of book set in the region he have handle in those book an astonishingly complete list of matter which have be important in the south during the past hundred year it be more difficult with faulkner than with most author to say what be the extent and what be the source of he knowledge he own testimony be that he have read very little in the history of the south imply that what he know of that history have come to he orally and that he know the world around he primarily from he own unassisted observation he denial of extensive read notwithstanding it be no doubt safe to assume that he have spend time school himself in southern history and that he have gain some acquaintance with the chief literary author who have live in the south or have write about the south to believe otherwise would be unrealistic but in look at faulkner against he background in mississippi and the south it be important not to lose the broad perspective he early work reflect heavy influence from english and continental writer evidence be plentiful that early and late also he have be indebted to the gothic romancer who deal in extravagant horror to the symbolist write at the end of the precede century and in particular to the stream-of-consciousness novelist henry jame and jame joyce among they he repeat experimentation with the technique of fiction testify to an independence of mind and an originality of approach but it also show he touch at many point the stream of literary development back of he i intention therefore be not to say that faulkner s awareness have be confine within the border of the south but rather that he have look at he world a a southerner and that presumably he outlook be southern the ingredient of faulkner s novel and story be by no mean new with he and most of the problem he take up have have the attention of author before he a useful comment on he relation to he region may be make i think by note briefly how in handle southern material and southern problem he have deviate from the pattern set by other southern author while remain faithful to the essential character of the region the planter aristocracy have appear in literature at least since john pendleton kennedy publish swallow-barn in 1832 and in he genial portrait of frank meriwether preside over he plantation dominion initiate the most persistent tradition of southern literature the thoroughgoing idealization of the planter society do not come however until after the civil war when southern writer be eager to defend a way of life which have be destroy a they look with nostalgia to a society which have be sweep away they be probably no more than half-conscious that they paint in color which have never exist they book find no less will reader outside than inside the south even while memory of the war be still sharp the tradition reach it apex perhaps in the work of thoma nelson page toward the end of the century and reappear undiminished a late a 1934 in the best-selling novel so red the rise by stark young although faulkner be the heir in he own family to this tradition he do not have stark young s inclination to romanticize and sentimentalize the planter society the myth of the southern plantation have have only a tangential relation with actuality a francis pendleton gaine show forty year ago and i suspect it have have a far narrow acceptance a something real than have generally be suppose faulkner have find it useful but he have employ it with he habitual independence of mind and skeptical outlook without say or seem to say that in portray the sartoris and the compson family faulkner s chief concern be social criticism we can say nevertheless that through those family he dramatize he comment on the planter dynasty a they have exist since the decade before the civil war it may be that in this comment he have break from the conventional pattern more violently than in any other regard for the treatment in he book be far remove from even the genial irony of ellen glasgow who be the only important novelist before he to challenge the conventional picture of planter society faulkner s low-class character have but few counterpart in early southern novel deal with plantation life they have an ancestry extend back however at least to 1728 when william byrd describe the lubberlanders he encounter in the back country of virginia and north carolina the chief literary antecedent of the snopes clan appear in the realistic humorous write which originate in the south and the southwest in the three decade before the civil war these narrative of coarse action and crude language appear first in local newspaper a a rule and late find they way between book cover though rarely into the planter library beside the morocco-bound volume of horace mr addison mr pope and sir walter scott there be evidence to suggest in fact that many author of the humorous sketch be prompt to write they or to make they a indelicate a they be by way of protest against the artificial refinement which have come to dominate the polite letter of the south william gilmore simms sturdy realist that he be plead for a natural robustness such a he find in he favorite the great elizabethan to vivify the pale writing be produce around he simms admire the raucous tale emanate from the backwoods but he have himself social affiliation which would not allow he to approve they fully augustus baldwin longstreet a preacher and a college and university president in four southern state publish the early of these backwoods sketch and in the character ransy sniffle in the account of sharp horse-trading and eye-gouging physical combat and in the shockingly unliterary speech of he character he set an example follow by many after he other who write of low character and low life include thoma bang thorpe creator of the big bear of arkansas and tom owen the bee-hunter johnson jones hooper whose character simon sugg bear a close kinship to flem snopes in both he willingness to take cruel advantage of all and sundry and the sharpness with which he habitually carry out he will and george washington harris whose tennessee hillbilly character sut lovingood perpetrate more unmalicious mischief and more unintended pain than any other character in literature it would be profitable i believe to read these realistic humorist alongside faulkner s work the think be not that he necessarily read they and owe anything to they directly but rather that they deal a hundred year ago with a class of people and a type of life which have continue down to we time to faulkner s time such a comparison remind we that in employ low character in he work faulkner be record actuality in the south and moreover be follow a long-established literary precedent such character with they low existence and often low morality produce humorous effect in he novel and tale a they do in the write of longstreet and hooper and harris but it need not be add that he give they far subtl and more intricate function than they have in the early writer nor be there need to add that among they be some of the most highly individualize and most successful of he character one of the early humorist already mention thoma bang thorpe can be use to illustrate another point where faulkner touch authentic southern material and also early literary treatment of those material thorpe come to louisiana from the east a a young man prepare to find in the new country the set of romantic adventure and idealize beauty but thorpe see also the hardship of pioneer existence the cultural poverty of the frontier settlement and the slack morality which abound in the new region a a consequence of the tension thus produce in he thought and feeling he write on the one hand sketch of idealize hunt trip and on the other an anecdote of the village of hardscrabble arkansas where no one have ever see a piano and he write also the masterpiece of frontier humor the big bear of arkansas in which earthy realism be place alongside the exaggeration of the backwoods tall-tale and the awe with which man contemplate the grandeur and the mystery of nature
