dash when the program be discontinue and they be dash no less by lack of skill in make selection of man and woman for development toward the high reach of the mind and spirit for the make of selection on the basis of excellence require that any foundation make the selection shall have available the judgment of a corps of advisor whose judgment be know to be good such judgment can be know to be good only by the record of those select by record make subsequent to they selection over considerable period of time the central group of the foundation s advisor be at any one period of time the member of we advisory board consist now of thirty-six man and woman they be choose by the foundation s board of trustee on the base of they own first-rate accomplishment in they different field of scholarship and the art they location in all part of the unite state and they location in the several kind of educational and research institution that be the principal home of we intellectual and artistic strength also be factor in the trustee mind for this concept of an advisory board ancillary to the board of trustee we be indebted to the late president of harvard university a lawrence lowell a master of the subject of the structure of cultural institution and they administration that we have the wit and wisdom to adopt mr lowell s concept and make it the base for we process of selection be one reason why we selection have be it may be say truly pretty uniformly good for in accordance with mr lowell s concept of an advisory board we selection be make by experience selector who give both constancy and consistency to we process and we choice and lest we should become too consistent in the sense of become heedless of new field of scholarship and new point of view in the art the

selection of fellow from canada the unite state and the english-speaking caribbean area and one for the selection of fellow from the latin american republic and the republic of the philippines to the member of we advisory board and most specially to it member who constitute we committee of selection the foundation be indebted for it success of choice of fellow we be a we know utterly dependent on the quality of advice we get and quality of advice add to devotion to the foundation s purpose and ideal we do get from we advisory board in measure so full that they can be appreciate only by those of we who work here every day but the fact about we advisory board and it member duty be only one of several set of fact about the quest for advice both reliable and imaginative on which to base we selection of fellow for example the interest of past member of the foundation s advisory board remain such that they place they knowledge and judgment at we disposal much a they have do when they be formally member of that board and besides there be a large number of scholar artist composer of music novelist poet essayist choreographer lawyer servant of government and man of affair hundreds indeed who serve the foundation well with the advice they give we freely and gratis out of they experience to all the foundation give the kind of thank which be more than thank to they we be grateful

policy and practice the effective recognition of excellence and it nurture have to be learn and be not learn in a day nor even in a year we be not give to lamentation neither personally nor in these report on the contrary if this be an apocalyptic era a be commonly say we see it a an era of opportunity for grant that there be great present-day problem to be solve these problem make great demand and by they demand tend to create resource of man s mind and heart which problem with easy answer do not bring forth of this example be legion pericle speak he funeral oration in ancient greece s

iuvabit a the roman poet virgil declare with much more historical sense than most writer of today it give indeed cause for rejoice to remember what many catastrophe of the past produce and it be to be note also that confidence should grow from remember that great man often appear in the past to turn local catastrophe into future good for all mankind for example out of the social evil of the english industrial revolution come the novel of charles dicken and he genius move he reader to seek solution of those evil for all western man until today in the industrialize west these social evil substantially do not exist the solution be not arrive at by any theoretician of the karl marx stripe but by man of government lawyer most of they and man of business these be educate man who a mr justice holmes be fond of say form they induction out of experience under the burden of responsibility that be to put it realistically they have to run they business at a profit or they have to get the vote to get elect nevertheless they make naught of marx s prophecy that capitalism would never pay the worker to use marx s word more than a subsistence wage with the consequence that increase productivity must inevitably find it way into the capitalist pocket with the result in turn that the gap between the rich and the poor would irrevocably widen and the misery of the poor increase but a all understand who have eye to see nothing of the kind have happen indeed the contrary have happen the gulf between the rich and the poor have narrow in the industrialize western world to the point that the word poor be hardly applicable and the reason this could happen be clear man of government business man lawyer and all who concern themselves with the welfare of they fellow man do not let they concern to run they business at a profit restrict the development of freedom and opportunity some would say that they be not permit to run they business only for profit and even put it that way would not prove that marx be anything but wrong sir henry sumner maine a hundred year before communism be a force to be reckon with write he brilliant legal generalization that the progress of society be from status to contract the essence of contract be that one be free to make a choice of what one will or will not do hence the condition of freedom be a necessary condition for choice the great the range of freedom for individual man the great the range of choice the great the range of choice the great the rate of change for change be dependent on the possibility that individual man glimpse for the future but when there be not freedom and opportunity to choose man individual man must remain in status and society do not can not progress the eternal truth be that progress due a it always be to individual creative genius be just a dependent on freedom a human life be dependent on the beat of the heart and lest anybody think that consideration such a these be not germane in a foundation report let i enlighten they with the truth that under communism there would have be no capital with which to endow the foundation and that there would not be that individual freedom within which the fellow might proceed untrammeled in every way toward they discovery they creative effort for the good of mankind during the year 1959 we grant 354 fellowship in 1960 we grant 334 a heretofore we fellowship be available to assist research in all field of knowledge and creative effort in all the art we do not favor one field over another we think that all inquiry all scholarly and artistic creation be good provide only that it contribute to a sense and understand of the true end of life a all first-rate scholarship and artistic creation do indeed if press we would say what the late robert henri american painter say to a pupil anything will do for a subject it s what you do with it that count thus we have no part and want none in current discussion of the relative importance of science the social study the humanities the creative art we want no part in such discussion because we think they largely futile and we think they largely futile because for true excellence of accomplishment every scholar and every artist must cross boundary of knowledge and boundary of point of view
