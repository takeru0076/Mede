biological warfare biological warfare be the intentional use of live microorganism or they toxic product for the purpose of destroy or reduce the military effectiveness of man it be the exploitation of the inherent potential of infectious disease agent by scientific research and development result in the production of bw weapon system man may also be injure secondarily by damage to he food crop or domestic animal biological warfare be consider to be primarily a strategic weapon the major reason for this be that it have no quick-kill effect the incubation period of infectious disease plus a variable period of illness even before a lethal effect render this weapon unsuitable for hand-to-hand encounter a man can be an effective fight machine throughout the incubation period of most infectious disease thus an enemy would probably use this weapon for attack on static population center such a large city an important operational procedure in bw for an enemy would be to create an areosol or cloud of agent over the target area this concept have stimulate much basic research concern the behavior of particulate biological material the pathogenesis of respiratory infection the medical management of such disease and defense against they occurrence the biological and physical property of infectious particle have be study intensively during the past fifteen year much new equipment and many unique technique have be develop for the quantitative exposure of experimental animal to aerosol of infectious agent contain in particle of specify dimensional characteristic much information have be gather relative to quantitative sample and assesment technique much of the old experimental work on respiratory infection be accomplish by very artificial procedure the intranasal instillation of a fluid suspension of infectious agent in an anesthetized animal be far different from exposure through natural respiration to aerosolized organism the importance of particle size in such aerosol have be thoroughly demonstrate the natural anatomical and physiological defensive feature of the upper respiratory tract such a the turbinates of the nose and the cilia of the trachea and large bronchi be capable of impinging out the large particle to which we be ordinarily expose in we daily existence very small particle however in a size range of 1 to 4 micron in diameter be capable of pass these impinging barrier and enter the alveolar bed of the lung this area be highly susceptible to infection the entrance and retention of infectious particle in the alveoli amount almost to an intratissue inoculation the relationship between particle size and infectious dose be illustrate in table 1 in consider bw defense it must be recognize that a number of critical meterological parameter must be meet for an aerosol to exhibit optimum effect for example bright sunlight be rapidly destructive for live microorganism suspend in air there be optimal humidity requirement for various agent when airborne neutral or inversion meteorological condition be necessary for a cloud to travel along the surface it will rise during lapse condition there be of course certain time during the 24-hour daily cycle when most of these condition will be meet certain other property of small particle in addition to those already mention in connection with penetration of the respiratory tract be noteworthy in defense consideration the small the particle the far it will travel downwind before settle out an aerosol of such small particle moreover diffuse through structure in much the same manner a a gas there may be a number of secondary effect result from diffusion through building such a widespread contamination of kitchen restaurant food store hospital etc depend on the organism there may be multiplication in some food or beverage product ie in milk for example the secondary consequence from this could be very serious and must be take into consideration in plan for defense something of the behavior of cloud of small particle can be illustrate by the follow field trial in the first trial an inert substance be disseminate from a boat travel some ten mile off shore under appropriately select meteorological condition zinc cadmium sulfide in particle of 2 micron in size be disseminate this material fluoresce under ultraviolet light which facilitate it sample and assessment four hundred and fifty pound be disseminate while the ship be travel a distance of 156 mile figure 1 describe the result obtain in this trial the particle travel a maximum detect distance of some 450 mile from these dosage isopleths it can be see that an area of over 34000 square mile be cover these dosage could have be increase by increase the source strength which be small in this case the behavior of a biological aerosol on a much small scale be illustrate by a specific field trial conduct with a non-pathogenic organism an aqueous suspension of the spore of b subtilis var niger generally know a bacillus globigii be aerosolized use commercially available nozzle a satisfactory cloud be produce even though these nozzle be only about 5 per cent efficient in produce an initial cloud in the size range of 1 to 5 micron in this test 130 gallon of a suspension have a count of afj organism per ml or a total of approximately afj spore be aerosolized the spray operation be conduct from the rear deck of a small naval vessel cruise two mile off-shore and vertical to an on-sure breeze spray continue along a two-mile course this operation be start at 500 pm and last for 29 minute there be a slight lapse condition a moderate fog and 100 per cent relative humidity a network of sample station have be set up on shore these be locate at the home of government employee in government office building and reservation within the trial area a rough attempt be make to characterize the vertical profile of the cloud by take sample from outside the window on the first ninth and fifteenth floor of a government office build all sampler be operate for a period of two hour except one which be operate for four hour in this instance there be a dosage of 562 during the first two hour and a total dosage of 1980 for the four-hour period a four-fold increase this suggest that the sample period particularly at the more distant location should have be increase a can be see from figure 2 an extensive area be cover by this aerosol the maximum distance sample be 23 mile from the source a can be see from these dosage isopleths approximately 100 square mile be cover within the area sample it be quite likely that an even great area be cover particularly downwind the dosage in the three level of the vertical profile be afj this be not of course enough sample to give a satisfactory description of the vertical diffusion of the aerosol a number of unique medical problem might be create when man be expose to an infectious agent through the respiratory route rather than by natural portal of entry some agent have be show to be much more toxic or infectious to experimental animal when expose to aerosol of optimum particle size than by the natural portal botulinal toxin for example be several thousand-fold more toxic by this route than when give per os in some instance a different clinical disease picture may result from this route of exposure make diagnosis difficult in tularemia produce by aerosol exposure one would not expect to find the classical ulcer of rabbit fever on a finger an enemy would obviously choose an agent that be believe to be highly infectious agent that be know to cause frequent infection among laboratory worker such a those cause q fever tularemia brucellosis glanders coccidioidomycosis etc belong in this category an agent would likely be select which would possess sufficient viability and virulence stability to meet realistic minimal logistic requirement it be obviously a proper goal of research to improve on this property in this connection it should be capable of be disseminate without excessive destruction moreover it should not be so fastidious in it growth requirement a to make production on a militarily significant scale improbable an aggressor would use an agent against which there be a minimal naturally acquire or artificially induce immunity in a target population a solid immunity be the one effective circumstance whereby attack by a specific agent can be neutralize it must be remember however that there be many agent for which there be no solid immunity and a partial or low-grade immunity may be break by an appropriate dose of agent there be a broad spectrum of organism from which selection for a specify military purpose might be make an enemy might choose an acutely debilitate microorganism a chronic disease producer or one cause a high rate of lethality it be possible that certain mutational form may be produce such a antibiotic resistant strain mutant may also be develop with change in biochemical property that be of importance in identification all of these consideration be of critical importance in consider defense and medical management biological agent be of course highly host-specific they do not destroy physical structure a be true of high explosive this may be of override importance in consider military objective the question of epidemic disease merit some discussion only a limit effort have be devote to this problem some of those who question the value of bw have assume that the only potential would be in the establishment of epidemic they then point out that with we present lack of knowledge of all the factor concern in the rise and fall of epidemic it be unlikely that a plan episode could be initiate they argue far and somewhat contradictorily that we knowledge and resource in preventive medicine would make it possible to control such an outbreak of disease this be why this approach to bw defense have not be give major attention we major problem be what an enemy might accomplish in an initial attack on a target this of course do not eliminate from consideration for this purpose agent that be associate naturally with epidemic disease a hypothetical example will illustrate this point let we assume that it would be possible for an enemy to create an aerosol of the causative agent of epidemic typhus rickettsia prowazwki over city a and that a large number of case of typhus fever result therefrom no epidemic be initiate nor be one expect because the population in city a be not lousy lousiness be a prerequisite for epidemic typhus in this case then the military objective be accomplish with an epidemic agent solely through the result secure in the initial attack this be do with full knowledge that there would be no epidemic on the other hand a similar attack might have be make on city b whose population be know to be lousy one might expect some spread of the disease in this case result in increase effectiveness of the attack the major defensive problem be concern with the possibility of overt military delivery of biological agent from appropriate disseminate device it should be no more difficult to deliver such device than other weapon the same delivery vehicle whether they be airplane submarine or guide missile should be usable if it be possible for an enemy to put an atomic bomb on a city it should be equally possible to put a cloud of biological agent over that city biological agent be moreover suitable for delivery through enemy sabotage which impose many problem in defense a few obvious target area of great importance might be mention the air condition and ventilate system of large building be subject to attack america be rapidly become a nation that use process precooked and even predigested food this be an enormous industry that be subject to sabotage one must include the preparation of soft drink and the process of milk and milk product huge industry be involve also in the production of biological product drug and cosmetic which be liable to this type of attack
