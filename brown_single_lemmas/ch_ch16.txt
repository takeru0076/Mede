a former do pont official become a general motor vice president and set about maximize do pont s share of the general motor market line of communication be establish between the two company and several do pont product be actively promote within a few year various do pont manufacture item be fill the entire requirement of from four to seven of general motor eight operate division the fisher body division long control by the fisher brother under a vote trust even though general motor own a majority of it stock follow an independent course for many year but by 1947 and 1948 resistance have collapse and it purchase from do pont compare favorably with purchase by other general motor division competitor come to receive high percentage of general motor business in late year but it be likely that this trend stem at least in part from the need of general motor outstrip do pont s capacity the fact that stick out in this voluminous record be that the bulk of do pont s production have always supply the large part of the requirement of the one customer in the automobile industry connect to do pont by a stock interest the inference be overwhelming that do pont s command position be promote by it stock interest and be not gain solely on competitive merit 353 we at 605 this court agree with the trial court that consideration of price quality and service be not overlook by either do pont or general motor 353 we at 606 however it determine that neither this factor nor the fact that all concern in high executive post in both company act honorably and fairly each in the honest conviction that he action be in the good interest of he own company and without any design to overreach anyone include do pont s competitor outweigh the government s claim for relief this claim a submit to the district court and dismiss by it 126 fsupp235 allege violation not only of 7 of the clayton act but also of 1 and 2 of the sherman act the latter provision proscribe any contract combination or conspiracy in restraint of interstate or foreign trade and monopolization of or attempt combination or conspiracy to monopolize such trade however this court put to one side without consideration the government s appeal from the dismissal of it sherman act allegation it rest it decision solely on 7 which read in pertinent part no corporation engage in commerce shall acquire directly or indirectly the whole or any part of the stock or other share capital of another corporation engage also in commerce where the effect of such acquisition may be to substantially lessen competition between the corporation whose stock be so acquire and the corporation make the acquisition or to restrain such commerce in any section or community or tend to create a monopoly of any line of commerce this section shall not apply to corporation purchase such stock solely for investment and not use the same by vote or otherwise to bring about or in attempt to bring about the substantial lessen of competition the purpose of this provision be thus explain in the court s opinion section 7 be design to arrest in it incipiency not only the substantial lessen of competition from the acquisition by one corporation of the whole or any part of the stock of a compete corporation but also to arrest in they incipiency restraint or monopoly in a relevant market which a a reasonable probability appear at the time of suit likely to result from the acquisition by one corporation of all or any part of the stock of any other corporation the section be violate whether or not actual restraint or monopoly or the substantial lessen of competition have occur or be intend 353 we at 589 thus a find of conspiracy to restrain trade or attempt to monopolize be exclude from the court s decision indeed a already note the court proceed on the assumption that the executive involve in the dealing between do pont and general motor act honorably and fairly and exercise they business judgment only to serve what they deem the good interest of they own company this however do not bar find that do pont have become pre-eminent a a supplier of automotive fabric and finish to general motor that these product constitute a line of commerce within the mean of the clayton act that general motor share of the market for these product be substantial and that competition for this share of the market be endanger by the financial relationship between the two concern the statutory policy of foster free competition be obviously further when no supplier have an advantage over he competitor from an acquisition of he customer s stock likely to have the effect condemn by the statute we repeat that the test of a violation of 7 be whether at the time of suit there be a reasonable probability that the acquisition be likely to result in the condemn restraint the conclusion upon this record be inescapable that such likelihood be prove a to this acquisition 353 we at 607 on the basis of the finding which lead to this conclusion the court remand the case to the district court to determine the appropriate relief the sole guidance give the court for discharge the task commit to it be this the judgment must therefore be reverse and the cause remand to the district court for a determination after far hear of the equitable relief necessary and appropriate in the public interest to eliminate the effect of the acquisition offensive to the statute the district court in the frame of equitable decree be clothe with large discretion to model they judgement to fit the exigency of the particular case international salt co v unite state 332 we 392 400-401 353 we at 607-608 this bring we to the course of the proceeding in the district court 2 this court s judgment be file in the district court on

plan within thirty day counsel for do pont indicate a preference for the submission of detail plan by both side at an early date no previous antitrust case he say have involve interest of such magnitude or present such complex problem of relief the submission of detail plan would place the issue before the court more readily than would discussion of divestiture or disenfranchisement in the

or subscription right to it stockholder on june 6 1958 general motor submit it objection to the government s proposal it argue inter alia that a divestiture order would severely depress the market value of the stock of both general motor and do pont with consequent serious loss and hardship to hundreds of thousands of innocent investor among they thousands of small trust and charitable institution that there would be a similar decline in the market value of other automotive and chemical stock with similar loss to the stockholder of those company that the tremendous volume of general motor stock hang over the market for ten year would hamper the effort of general motor and other automobile manufacturer to raise equity capital and that all this would have a serious adverse effect on the entire stock market and on general business activity general motor comprehensively contend that the government plan would not be in the public interest a require by the mandate of this court
