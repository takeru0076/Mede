she live and be give a name helva for she first three vegetable month she wave she crab claw kick weakly with she club foot and enjoy the usual routine of the infant she be not alone for there be three other such child in the big city s special nursery soon they all be remove to central laboratory school where they delicate transformation begin one of the baby die in the initial transferral but of helva s class seventeen thrive in the metal shell instead of kick foot helva s neural response start she wheel instead of grab with hand she manipulate mechanical extension a she mature more and more neural synapse would be adjust to operate other mechanism that go into the maintenance and run of a space ship for helva be destined to be the brain half of a scout ship partner with a man or a woman whichever she choose a the mobile half she would be among the elite of she kind she initial intelligence test register above normal and she adaptation index be unusually high a long a she development within she shell live up to expectation and there be no side-effect from the pituitary tinker helva would live a reward rich and unusual life a far cry from what she would have face a an ordinary normal be however no diagram of she brain pattern no early iq test record certain essential fact about helva that central must eventually learn they would have to bide they official time and see trust that the massive dose of shell-psychology would suffice she too a the necessary bulwark against she unusual confinement and the pressure of she profession a ship run by a human brain could not run rogue or insane with the power and resource central have to build into they scout ship brain ship be of course long past the experimental stage most babe survive the technique of pituitary manipulation that keep they body small eliminate the necessity of transfer from small to large shell and very very few be lose when the final connection be make to the control panel of ship or industrial combine shell people resemble mature dwarf in size whatever they natal deformity be but the well-oriented brain would not have change place with the most perfect body in the universe so for happy year helva scoot around in she shell with she classmate play such game a stall power-seek study she lesson in trajectory propulsion technique computation logistics mental hygiene basic alien psychology philology space history law traffic code all the et ceteras that eventually become compound into a reason logical inform citizen not so obvious to she but of more importance to she teacher helva ingest the precept of she condition a easily a she absorb she nutrient fluid she would one day be grateful to the patient drone of the sub-conscious-level instruction helva s civilization be not without busy do-good association explore possible inhumanities to terrestrial a well a extraterrestrial citizen one such group get all incense over shell child when helva be just turn fourteen when they be force to central world shrug it shoulder arrange a tour of the laboratory school and set the tour off to a big start by show the member case history complete with photograph very few committee ever look past the first few photo most of they original objection about shell be overridden by the relief that these hideous to they body be mercifully conceal helva s class be do fine art a selective subject in she crowd program she have activate one of she microscopic tool which she would late use for minute repair to various part of she control panel she subject be large a copy of the last supper and she canvas small the head of a tiny screw she have tune she sight to the proper degree a she work she absentmindedly croon produce a curious sound shell people use they own vocal cord and diaphragm but sound issue through microphone rather than mouth helva s hum then have a curious vibrancy a warm dulcet quality even in it aimless chromatic wandering why what a lovely voice you have say one of the female visitor helva look up and catch a fascinate panorama of regular dirty crater on a flaky pink surface she hum become a gurgle of surprise she instinctively regulate she sight until the skin lose it crater look and the pore assume normal proportion yes we have quite a few year of voice train madam remark helva calmly vocal peculiarity often become excessively irritate during prolong intra-stellar distance and must be eliminate i enjoy i lesson although this be the first time that helva have see unshelled people she take this experience calmly any other reaction would have be report instantly i mean that you have a nice sing voice dear the lady amend thank you would you like to see i work helva ask politely she instinctively sheer away from personal discussion but she file the comment away for far meditation work ask the lady i be currently reproduce the last supper on the head of a screw no i say the lady twitter helva turn she vision back to magnification and survey she copy critically of course some of i color value do not match the old master s and the perspective be faulty but i believe it to be a fair copy the lady s eye unmagnified bug out oh i forget and helva s voice be really contrite if she could have blush she would have you people do nt have adjustable vision the monitor of this discourse grin with pride and amusement a helva s tone indicate pity for the unfortunate here this will help suggest helva substitute a magnify device in one extension and hold it over the picture in a kind of shock the lady and gentleman of the committee bend to observe the incredibly copy and brilliantly execute last supper on the head of a screw well remark one gentleman who have be force to accompany he wife the good lord can eat where angel fear to tread be you refer sir ask helva politely to the dark age discussion of the number of angel who could stand on the head of a pin i have that in mind if you substitute atom for angel the problem be not insoluble give the metallic content of the pin in question which you be programe to compute of course do they remember to program a sense of humor a well young lady we be direct to develop a sense of proportion sir which contribute the same effect the good man chortle appreciatively and decide the trip be worth he time if the investigation committee spend month digest the thoughtful food serve they at the laboratory school they leave helva with a morsel a well sing a applicable to herself require research she have of course be expose to and enjoy a music appreciation course which have include the good know classical work such a tristan und isolde candide oklahoma nozze de figaro the atomic age singer eileen farrell elvis presley and geraldine todd a well a the curious rhythmic progression of the venusian capellan visual chromatic and the sonic concerti of the altairians but sing for any shell person pose considerable technical difficulty to be overcome shell people be school to examine every aspect of a problem or situation before make a prognosis balance properly between optimism and practicality the nondefeatist attitude of the shell people lead they to extricate themselves they ship and personnel from bizarre situation therefore to helva the problem that she could nt open she mouth to sing among other restriction do not bother she she would work out a method by-pass she limitation whereby she could sing she approach the problem by investigate the method of sound reproduction through the century human and instrumental she own sound production equipment be essentially more instrumental than vocal breath control and the proper enunciation of vowel sound within the oral cavity appear to require the most development and practice shell people do not strictly speak breathe for they purpose oxygen and other gas be not draw from the surround atmosphere through the medium of lung but sustain artificially by solution in they shell after experimentation helva discover that she could manipulate she diaphragmic unit to sustain tone by relax the throat muscle and expand the oral cavity well into the frontal sinuses she could direct the vowel sound into the most felicitous position for proper reproduction through she throat microphone she compare the result with tape recording of modern singer and be not unpleased although she own tape have a peculiar quality about they not at all unharmonious merely unique acquire a repertoire from the laboratory library be no problem to one train to perfect recall she find herself able to sing any role and any song which strike she fancy it would not have occur to she that it be curious for a female to sing bass baritone tenor alto mezzo soprano and coloratura a she please it be to helva only a matter of the correct reproduction and diaphragmic control require by the music attempt if the authority remark on she curious avocation they do so among themselves shell people be encourage to develop a hobby so long a they maintain proficiency in they technical work on the anniversary of she sixteenth year in she shell helva be unconditionally graduate and install in she ship the afj she permanent titanium shell be recess behind an even more indestructible barrier in the central shaft of the scout ship the neural audio visual and sensory connection be make and seal she extendibles be divert connect or augment and the final delicate-beyond-description brain tap be complete while helva remain anesthetically unaware of the proceeding when she awake she be the ship she brain and intelligence control every function from navigation to such load a a scout ship of she class need she could take care of herself and she ambulatory half in any situation already record in the annal of central world and any situation it most fertile mind could imagine she first actual flight for she and she kind have make mock flight on dummy panel since she be eight show she complete mastery of the technique of she profession she be ready for she great adventure and the arrival of she mobile partner there be nine qualify scout sit around collect base pay the day helva be commission there be several mission which demand instant attention but helva have be of interest to several department head in central for some time and each man be determine to have she assign to he section consequently no one have remember to introduce helva to the prospective partner the ship always choose it own partner have there be another brain ship at the base at the moment helva would have be guide to make the first move a it be while central wrangle among itself robert tanner sneak out of the pilot barracks out to the field and over to helva s slim metal hull hello anyone at home tanner wisecrack of course reply helva logically activate she outside scanner be you i partner she ask hopefully a she recognize the scout service uniform all you have to do be ask he retort hopefully no one have come i think perhaps there be no partner available and i ve have no directive from central even to herself helva sound a little self-pitying but the truth be she be lonely sit on the darken field always she have have the company of other shell and more recently technician by the score the sudden solitude have lose it momentary charm and become oppressive no directive from central be scarcely a cause for regret but there happen to be eight other guy bite they fingernail to the quick just wait for an invitation to board you you beautiful thing
