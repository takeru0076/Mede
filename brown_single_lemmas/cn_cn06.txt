such be i state of mind that i do not question the possibility of this under the circumstance i be only too will to confess all i be nearly thirty at the time i go to the hall in the afternoon only on these preliminary matter it be dark and i sense very large only the counter at one end be light by a long fluorescent tube suspend directly above it sometimes i be aware of people move about in the darkness i would turn away from i write in the hope of get a good look at they but i never quite succeed a glimpse of three of four vague figure at the most drift here and there squat a if wait the pulse glow of a cigarette since they could see i but i not they they presence in the hall disturb i the clerk pay they no attention this impress i until i realize how limit be he sphere of influence he job simply consist in register new man when the phone ring he answer it he authority extend to the far edge of the counter no far none of the man hang around the hall bother to speak to he baldness be attack he pate he speak to i in a gruff voice an affectation which quite bely he personality he wear he white shirt open at the neck reveal a bit of scrawny pale chest underneath it be obvious that he wish himself different from the sort of person he think he be but it be not easy for he and he often slip when one of the man in the hall behind we spit on the floor and scrape he boot over the gob of spittle i notice how the clerk wince i feel certain he be really a spineless little man he hat the cause of he baldness hang on a hook on the wall and underneath it i could see he tie knot ready to be slip over he head a black badge of fray respectability that ought never to have leave he neck the morning s tabloid be on the counter and a stack of dog-eared man s magazine on a shelf in the office behind the counter be a small radio dial permanently on a station which broadcast only vulgar commercial and cheap popular music everything about the clerk be trivial once press he i learn that he job be only part-time in the afternoon when nothing go on in the hall notice i disappointment he attempt to salvage what scrap and shred of authority he feel might still be cling to he person with distaste i see he assume a pompous air when he see i come he turn he radio off he make a show of rearranging i form on the shelf he would pick up the ring phone with study negligence then bark into it with gruff importance what limit knowledge he possess he force upon i in the morning i be inform fluorescent tube similar to the one above the counter illuminate the entire hall they and the two large fan which i could dimly see a daylight filter through they vent down at the far end of the hall could be turn on by a master switch situate inside the office he point out the switch to i and for a moment i foolishly believe that he would let deed follow word i be show instead a batch of white ticket of the sort hand out he tell i every morning now here be something of obvious importance to i yet when i reach for the ticket he snatch they away from i hand he could nt afford to have anyone mess around with they he say each of those ticket be of great value to it rightful recipient i withdraw i hand late i would remember what this pompous little man have tell i about the worth of a ticket have nothing else to do except wait for i form to be process i give myself over to speculation concern the hall itself when suitably light what would it look like the presence of the two exhaust fan seem to indicate that the hall could become crowd for air one afternoon upon receive permission and the necessary instruction from the clerk i have visit the toilet adjoin the hall by count the number of stall and urinal i attempt to form a loose estimate of how many man the hall would hold at one time for although i have cross a corner of the hall on i way to the toilet i still could not tell for sure how far to the rear the darkness extend i could observe the two fan down at the end but they size in themselves mean nothing to i a long a i have no measure of comparison i have for some time be hope in vain for one of the dim figure to pass between the fan vent and myself i know that three or four of they be almost always present in the hall but what they be do and exactly where i could not tell it be i feel possible that they be man who have receive no ticket for that day have remain in the hall to sleep perhaps in the corner far remove from the counter with it overhead light this light do not penetrate very far back into the hall and i eye be hinder rather than aid by the dim daylight enter through the fan vent when i try to pick out whatever might be lie or squat on the floor below also the clerk appear to disapprove of i frequent curious glance back over i shoulder no sooner would i turn i head away from the counter before he would address i at time quite sharply in order to bring back i attention and i have hardly finish i business in the toilet on the aforementioned occasion when the light in that place like the hall light control from the switch in the office flick off and on impatiently this sort of petty vigilance annoy i i feel certain it be self-appointed it spring from a type of mentality i d encounter often enough but certainly have not expect to find here i decide to see no more of the clerk until the process of i paper be complete i feel strongly attach to the hall however and hardly a day pass when i do not go to look at it from a distance i live in a state of suspense because of it i could not cling to i past nor do i wish to i have sign it off on the form i future lie solely with the hall yet what do i know about the hall at this point although i have be inside it i have not yet see it function i wish to prepare myself but do not even know what sort of clothe i ought to be wear i do not despair however far from it i be constantly search for clue around the neighborhood of the hall though only a relatively short walk separate it from i own part of town it character be wholly foreign to i large warehouse flank the street on which the hall front the river be only a few block away but an unbroken line of pier prevent i from see it sometimes i notice the top of ship mast and funnel reach above the pier roof the sound issue from beyond winch whir man shout indicate great activity and excite i the hall on the other hand appear lifeless and desert on these long waterfront afternoon it resemble nothing i d ever see before it front be windowless but irregularity in the masonry might be an indication that window now blind have once look out upon the street i keep circle the block hope to see from the street behind it the rear of the hall but it be not a tall structure and other building conceal it for week i wander about this neighborhood of warehouse and garage truck terminal and taxi repair shop gasoline pump and longshoreman s lunch counter yet never do i cease to feel myself a strange there i return to the hall despite i dislike for the clerk a i have expect he insist that i visit to the hall would do nothing to far the process of i application meanwhile spring have pass well into summer at last when i put it to he directly the clerk be force to admit that the delay in i case be unusual when i ask he what if anything i could do about it he surprise i by refer i to the director of the hall i could consult this personage on any weekday morning though not before ten oclock the clerk impress this upon i that i should not arrive in the hall before ten oclock when i go for i interview with the director i see why although it be dark a usual i could see that the hall have only recently contain a great many people cigarette butt litter the floor the big fan be go draw from the large room the remnant of stale smoke which drift about in pale stratum underneath the ceiling i have feel the draft they be make while mount the stairs the staircase itself seem still to be echo the heavy footfall of many man i stop by the counter no one be behind it but in the rear wall of the office i notice for the first time a door which have be leave partially open past it i could see part part of a desk a flag in a corner a rug on the floor the director s office i rap i knuckle on the counter the director come to the door i be at once disappoint although just what i have expect he to look like i could not have explain he be a man in he late forties with gray hair of medium height he look dapper in a lightweight summer suit word silk tie and green-tinted soft collar he wear perforate white-topped shoe they somehow make i expect to see he launch into a vaudeville tapdance routine any moment but he come toward i sedately enough show i around the counter offer i a seat inside he office then walk to a file cabinet and get out i application i have the impression that he have read i form perhaps several time he do not look at they now a he lower himself on the chair behind he desk i wonder what this dapper slightly ridiculous man could possibly have to do with the working of the hall he speak in a voice a immaculate a he appearance why have i register beg i pardon he must express he astonishment over see a person of i background apply at the hall he have look over i form and be impress by what he have see there indeed i scholastic qualification be such that he a college graduate himself must envy i they be i sure he ask that i know what i be apply for what sort of man i would come into contact with at the hall these question do not surprise i i feel certain that the director like the afternoon clerk seldom move beyond the counter that the hall to they be a jungle a dark and unwelcome place though i doubt that he would understand i i tell the director i motive for apply i have always i say hanker after work hard with i hand this desire i go on grow voluble a i conviction be arouse have mount at such a rate recently that i now find it realization necessary not only to i physical but also to i spiritual wellbeing to this effect i have already sever all connection which bind i to i former existence
