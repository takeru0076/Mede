the late rg collingwood a philosopher whose work have prove helpful to many student of literature once write we be all though many of we be snobbish enough to wish to deny it in far close sympathy with the art of the music-hall and picture-palace than with chaucer and cimabue or even shakespeare and titian by an effort of historical sympathy we can cast we mind back into the art of a remote past or an alien present and enjoy the carving of caveman and japanese colour-prints but the possibility of this effort be bind up with that development of historical think which be the great achievement of we civilization in the last two century and it be utterly impossible to people in whom this development have not take place the natural and primary aesthetic attitude be to enjoy contemporary art to despise and dislike the art of the recent past and wholly to ignore everything else one might argue that the ultimate purpose of literary scholarship be to correct this spontaneous provincialism that be likely to obscure the horizon of the general public of the newspaper critic and of the creative artist himself there result a study of literature free from the tyranny of the contemporary such study may take many form the study of idea in literature be one of these of course it go without say that no student of idea can justifiably ignore the contemporary scene he will frequently return to it the continuity contrast and similarity discernible when past and present be survey together be inexhaustible and the one be often understand through the other when we assert the value of such study we find ourselves commit to an important assumption most student of literature whether they call themselves scholar or critic be ready to argue that it be possible to understand literary work a well a to enjoy they many will add that we may find we enjoyment heighten by we understand this understand of course may in it turn take many form and some of these especially those most interest to the student of comparative literature be essentially historical but the historian of literature need not confine he attention to biography or to stylistic question of form texture or technique he may also consider idea it be true that this distinction between style and idea often approach the arbitrary since in the end we must admit that style and content frequently influence or interpenetrate one another and sometimes appear a expression of the same insight but in general we may argue that the student can direct the primary emphasis of he attention toward one or the other at this point a work definition of idea be in order although we first definition will have to be qualify somewhat a we proceed the term idea refer to we more reflective or thoughtful consciousness a oppose to the immediacy of sensuous or emotional experience it be through such reflection that literature approach philosophy an idea let we say may be roughly define a a theme or topic with which we reflection may be concern in this essay we be along with most historian interest in the more general or more inclusive idea that be so to speak writ large in history of literature where they recur continually outstanding among these be the idea of human nature itself include the many definition that have be advance over the century also secondary notion such a the perfectibility of man the depravity of man and the dignity of man one might indeed argue that the history of idea in so far a it include the literature must center on characterization of human nature and that the great period of literary achievement may be distinguish from one another by reference to the image of human nature that they succeed in fashion we need not to be sure expect to find such idea in every piece of literature an idea of the sort that we have in mind although of necessity readily available to imagination be more general in connotation than most poetic or literary image especially those appear in lyric poem that seek to capture a moment of personal experience thus burn s i love be like a red red rise and hopkins the thunder-purple sea-beach plume purple of thunder although clearly intelligible in content hardly present idea of the sort with which we be here concern on the other hand arnold s the unplumbed salt estranging sea take in it context certainly do so understand a work of art involve recognition of the idea that it reflect or embody thus the student of literature may sometimes find it helpful to classify a poem or an essay a be in idea or in ideal content or subject matter typical or atypical of it period again he may discover embody within it texture a theme or idea that have be present elsewhere and at other time in various way we understand will very probably require both these commentary very likely it will also include a recognition that the work we be read reflect or belong to some way of think label a a school or an -ism ie a complex or syndrome of idea occur together with sufficient prominence to warrant identification thus idea like grace salvation and providence cluster together in traditional christianity usually the work study offer we a special or even an individualize render or treatment of the idea in question so that the student find it necessary to distinguish carefully between the several expression of an -ism or mode of think accordingly we may speak of the platonism peculiar to shelley s poem or the type of stoicism present in henley s invictus and we may find that describe such platonism or such stoicism and contrast each with other expression of the same attitude or mode of think be a difficult and challenge enterprise after all shelley be no orthodox or hellenic platonist and even he romantic platonism can be distinguish from that of he contemporary again henley s attitude of defiance which color he ideal of self-mastery be far from characteristic of a stoic thinker like marcus aurelius whose gentle acquiescence be almost christian comparable to the patience express in milton s sonnet on he own blindness in recent year we have come increasingly to recognize that idea have a history and that not the least important chapter of this history have to do with thematic or conceptual aspect of literature and the art although these aspect should be study in conjunction with the history of philosophy of religion and of the science when these field be survey together important pattern of relationship emerge indicate a vast community of reciprocal influence a continuity of think and expression include many tradition primarily literary religious and philosophical but frequently include contact with the fine art and even to some extent with science here we may observe that at least one modern philosophy of history be build on the assumption that idea be the primary objective of the historian s research let we quote once more from rg collingwood history be properly concern with the action of human being regard from the outside an action be an event or series of event occur in the physical world regard from the inside it be the carry into action of a certain think the historian s business be to penetrate to the inside of the action with which he be deal and reconstruct or rather rethink the thought which constitute they it be a characteristic of thought that in re-think they we come ipso facto to understand why they be think such an understand although it must seek to be sympathetic be not a matter of intuition history have this in common with every other science that the historian be not allow to claim any single piece of knowledge except where he can justify he claim by exhibit to himself in the first place and secondly to any one else who be both able and will to follow he demonstration the ground upon which it be base this be what be mean above by describe history a inferential the knowledge in virtue of which a man be an historian be a knowledge of what the evidence at he disposal prove about certain event it be obvious that the historian who seek to recapture the idea that have motivate human behavior throughout a give period will find the art and literature of that age one of he central and major concern by no mean a mere supplement or adjunct of significant historical research the student of idea and they place in history will always be concern with the pattern of transition which be at the same time pattern of transformation whereby idea pass from one area of activity to another let we survey for a moment the development of modern think turn we attention from the reformation toward the revolutionary and romantic movement that follow and dwelling finally on more recent decade we may thus trace the notion of individual autonomy from it manifestation in religious practice and theological reflection through practical politics and political theory into literature and the art finally we may note that the idea appear in educational theory where it influence be at present widespread no one will deny that such broad development and transition be of great intrinsic interest and the study of idea in literature would be woefully incomplete without frequent reference to they still we must remember that we can not construct and justify generalization of this sort unless we be ready to consider many special instance of influence move between such area a theology philosophy political think and literature the actual moment of contact be vitally important these moment be historical event in the life of individual author with which the student of comparative literature must be frequently concern perhaps the most powerful and most frequently recur literary influence on the western world have be that of the old and new testament certainly one of the most important comment that can be make upon the spiritual and cultural life of any period of western civilization during the past sixteen or seventeen century have to do with the way in which it leader have read and interpret the bible this read and the comment that it evoke constitute the influence a contrast of the scripture read of let we say st augustine john bunyan and thoma jefferson all three of whom find in such study a real source of enlightenment can tell we a great deal about these three man and the age that each represent and help bring to conscious expression in much the same way we recognize the importance of shakespeare s familarity with plutarch and montaigne of shelley s study of plato s dialogue and of coleridge s enthusiastic plunder of the writing of many philosopher and theologian from plato to schelling and william godwin through which so many abstract idea be bring to the attention of english man of letter we may also recognize case in which the poet have influence the philosopher and even indirectly the scientist english philosopher samuel alexander s debt to wordsworth and meredith be a recent interest example a also an whitehead s understand of the english romantic chiefly shelley and wordsworth hegel s profound admiration for the insight of the greek tragedian indicate a broad channel of classical influence upon nineteenth-century philosophy again the student of evolutionary biology will find a fascinate if to we mind grotesque anticipation of the theory of chance variation and the natural elimination of the unfit in lucretius who in turn seem to have borrow the concept from the philosopher empedocles here an important caveat be in order we must avoid the notion suggest to some people by example such a those just mention that idea be unit in some way comparable to coin or counter that can be pass intact from one group of people to another or even for that matter from one individual to another
