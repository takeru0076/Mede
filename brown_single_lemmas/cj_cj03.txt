a band viscometer be show in figure 2 it consist of two block with flat surface hold apart by shim there be a small well in the top in which the fluid or paste to be test be place a tape of cellulose acetate be pull between the block and the tape pull the fluid or paste with it between the parallel face of the block in normal use weight be hang on the end of the tape and allow to pull the tape and the material to be test between the block after it have reach terminal velocity the time for the tape to travel a know distance be record by the use of various weight data for a force-rate of shear graph can be obtain the instrument use for this work be a slight modification of that previously describe in this test a afj tape be pull between the block with a motor and pulley at a rate of afj with a clearance of 0002 on each side of the tape this give a rate of shear of afj this however can only be consider approximate a the diameter of the pulley be increase by the build-up of tape and the tape be occasionally remove from the pulley during the run the face of one block contain a hole 116 in diameter which lead to a manometer for the measurement of the normal pressure although there be only four fluid test it be apparent that there be two distinct type two of the fluid show a high-positive normal pressure when undergo shear and two show small negative pressure which be negligible in comparison with the amount of the positive pressure generate by the other two figure 3 show the data on a silicone fluid label 12500 cps which give a high positive normal pressure although the tape be run for over 1 hr a steady state be not reach and it be conclude that the reason for this be that the back pressure of the manometer be build up from the material feed from between the block and this be available at a very slow rate a system have to be use which do not depend upon the feed of the fluid into the manometer if measurement of the normal pressure be to be make in a reasonable time a back pressure be then introduce and the rise or fall of the material in the manometer indicate which be great the normal pressure in the block or the back pressure by this method it be determine that the normal pressure exert by a sample of polybutene molecular weight report to be 770 be over half an atmosphere the actual pressure be not determine because the pressure be beyond the upper limit of the apparatus on hand the two fluid which give the small negative pressure be polybutenes with molecular weight which be state to be 520 and 300 these be fluid which one would expect to be less viscoelastic or more newtonian because of they low molecular weight the maximum suction be 325 of test fluid measure from the top of the block and steady state be apparently reach with these fluid it be presume that this negative head be associate with some geometric factor of the assembly since different reading be obtain with the same fluid and the only apparent difference be the assembly and disassembly of the apparatus this negative pressure be not explain by the velocity head afj since this be not sufficient to explain the reading by several magnitude these experiment can be consider exploratory only however they do demonstrate the presence of large normal pressure in the presence of flat shear field which be forecast by the theory in the first part of the paper they also give information which will aid in the design of a more satisfactory instrument for the measurement of the normal pressure such an instrument would be useful for the characterization of many commercial material a well a theoretical study the elasticity be a parameter of fluid which be not subject to simple measurement at present and it be a parameter which be probably vary in an unknown manner with many commercial material such an instrument be expect to be especially useful if it could be use to measure the elasticity of heavy paste such a print ink paint adhesive molten plastic and bread dough for the elasticity be relate to those various property term length shortness spinnability etc which be usually judge by subjective method at present the actual change afj cause by a shear field be calculate by multiply the pressure differential time the volume just a it be for any gravitational or osmotic pressure head if the volume be the molal volume then afj be obtain on a molal basis which be the customary terminology of the chemist although the afj calculation be obvious by analogy with that for gravitational field and osmotic pressure it be interest to confirm it by a method which can be generalize to include relate effect consider a shear field with a height of h and a cross-sectional area of a oppose by a manometer with a height of h refer to the same base a h and a cross-sectional area of a if afj be the change per unit volume in gibbs function cause by the shear field at constant p and t and \*\* yr be the density of the fluid then the total potential energy of the system above the reference height be afj afj be the work necessary to fill the manometer column from the reference height to h the total volume of the system above the reference height be afj and h can be eliminate to obtain an equation for the total potential energy of the system in term of h the minimum total potential energy be find by take the derivative with respect to h and equate to zero this give afj which be the pressure this be interest for it combine both the thermodynamic concept of a minimum gibbs function for equilibrium and minimum mechanical potential energy for equilibrium this method can be extend to include the concentration difference cause by shear field the relation between osmotic pressure and the gibbs function may also be develop in an analogous way in the above development we have apply the thermodynamics of equilibrium refer to by some a thermostatics to the steady state this can be justify thermodynamically in this case and this will be do in a separate paper which be be prepare this have an interest analogy with the assumption state by philippoff that the deformational mechanic of elastic solid can be apply to flow solution there be one exception to the above statement a have be point out and that be that fluid can relax by flow into field of low rate of shear so the statement should be modify by state that the mechanic be similar if the mechanic be similar we can also infer that the thermodynamics will also be similar the concept of the strain energy a a gibbs function difference afj and exert a force normal to the shear face be compatible with the information obtain from optical birefringence study of fluid undergo shear essentially these birefringence study show that at low rate of shear a tension be present at 45-degrees to the direction of shear and a the rate of shear increase the direction of the maximum tension move asymptotically toward the direction of shear accord to philippoff the recoverable shear s be give by afj where \*\* yc be the angle of extinction from this and the force of deformation it should be possible to calculate the elastic energy of deformation which should be equal to the afj calculate from the pressure normal to the shear face there be another mean which should show the direction and relative value of the stress in viscoelastic fluid that be not mention a such in the literature and that be the shape of the suspend drop of low viscosity fluid in shear field these droplet be distort by the normal force just a a balloon would be pull or press out of shape in one s hand these droplet appear to be ellipsoid and it be mathematically convenient to assume that they be if they be not ellipsoid the conclusion will be a reasonable approximation the direction of the tension of minimum pressure be of course give by the direction of the major axis of the ellipsoid mason and taylor both show that the major axis of the ellipsoid be at 45-degrees at low rate of shear and that it approach the direction of shear with increase rate of shear some suspension break up before they be near to the direction of shear and some become asymptotic to it without breakup this be of course a similar type of behavior to that indicate by birefringence study the relative force can be calculate from the various radius of curvature if we assume a the surface tension be uniform on the surface of the drop b that because of the low viscosity of the fluid the internal pressure be the same in all direction c the kinetic effect be negligible d since the shape of the drop conform to the force field it do not appreciably affect the distribution of force in the fluid these be reasonable assumption with low viscosity fluid suspend in high viscosity fluid which be subject to low rate of shear just a the pressure exert by surface tension in a spherical drop be afj and the pressure exert by surface tension on a cylindrical shape be afj the pressure exert by any curve surface be afj where \*\* yg be the interfacial tension and afj and afj be the two radius of curvature this formula be give by rumscheidt and mason if a be the major axis of an ellipsoid and b and c be the other two ax the radius of curvature in the ab plane at the end of the axis afj and the difference in pressure along the a and b ax be afj there be no data publish in the literature on the shape of low viscosity drop to confirm the above formula however there be photograph of suspend drop of cyclohexanol phthalate viscosity 155 poise suspend in corn syrup of 71 poise in a paper by mason and bartok this viscosity of the material in the drop be of course not negligible measurement on the photograph in this paper give afj at the maximum rate of shear of afj if it be assume that the formula give by lodge of cosec afj apply the pressure difference along the major ax can be calculate from the angle of inclination of the major axis and from this the interfacial tension can be calculate it value be afj from the above data this appear to be high a would be expect from the appreciable viscosity of the material in the drop it be appropriate to call attention to certain thermodynamic property of an ideal gas that be analogous to rubber-like deformation the internal energy of an ideal gas depend on temperature only and be independent of pressure or volume in other word if an ideal gas be compress and keep at constant temperature the work do in compress it be completely convert into heat and transfer to the surround heat sink this mean that work equal q which in turn equal afj there be a well-known relationship between probability and entropy which state that afj where \*\* zq be the probability that state ie volume for an ideal gas could be reach by chance alone this be know a conformational entropy this conformational entropy be in this case equal to the usual entropy for there be no other change or other energy involve note that though the ideal gas itself contain no additional energy the compress gas do exert an increase pressure the energy for any isothermal work do by the perfect gas must come a thermal energy from it surroundings
