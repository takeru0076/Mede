missouri golf s golden boy arnold palmer have be a blaze figure in golf over the past twelve month he win the master the unite state open and a record $ 80738 in prize money he be herald a sportsman of the year by sport illustrate and last night be acclaim in rochester a the professional athlete of the year a distinction that earn for he the $ 10000 diamond-studded hickok belt but he also achieve something that endear he to every duffer who ever flubbed a shoot a couple of week ago he score a monstrous 12 on a par-5 hole it make he human and it also stay the hand of thousands of brood incompetent who be meditate the abandonment of a sport whose frustration be drive they to despair if such a paragon of perfection a palmer could commit such a score sacrilege there be hope leave for all it be neither a spirit of self-sacrifice nor a yen to encourage the downtrodden that motivate arnold he merely become victimize by a form of athletics that respect no one and aggravate all the world s good golfer shoot below par come to the last hole of the open round of the los angeles open with every intention of deliver a final crusher he boom a 280-yard drive then the pixy and the zombies take over while the banshee wail in the distance no margin for error on the narrow fairway of a 508-yard hole arnold whip into he second shoot the ball go off in a majestic arc an out-of-bounds slice he try again and once more slice out of bound he hook the next two out of bound on the opposite side it be possible that i over-correct he say ruefully each of the four wayward shot cost he two stroke so he wind up with a dozen it be a nice round figure that 12 he say a he head for the clubhouse not too much perturb from the standpoint of the army of duffer however this be easily the most heartening exhibition they have have since ben hogan fall upon evil way during he heyday and score an 11 in the texas open the idol of the hacker of course be ray ainsley who achieve a 19 in the unite state open they secondary hero be another pro willie chisholm who drink he lunch during another open and try to blast he way out of a rock-strewn gully willie s partner be long jim barne who try to keep count stickler for rule how many be that jim ask willie at one stage of he excavation project thirteen say long jim nae man say willie you must be countin the echo he have a 16 palmer s dozen be honestly earn nor be there any rule to save he if there have be he would have find a loophole because arnold be one golfer who know the code a thoroughly a the man who write the book this knowledge have come in handy too he first shoot in the open last year land in a brook that flow along the right side of the fairway the ball float downstream a spectator pick up the ball and hand it to a small boy who drop this suddenly hot potato in a very playable lie arnold send for joe dey the executive secretary of the golf association joe naturally rule that a ball be drop from alongside the spot where it have originally enter the stream i know it all along confess arnold with a grin but i just happen to think how much nice it would be to drop one way up there for a serious young man who play golf with a serious intensity palmer have such an inherent sense of humor that it relieve the strain and keep he nerve from jangle like banjo string yet he remain the fierce of competitor he ll even bull head-on into the rule when he be sure he s right that s how he first win the master in 1958 it happen on the twelfth hole a 155-yarder arnold s iron shoot from the tee burrow into the bunker guard the green an embankment that have become soft and spongy from the rain thereby bring local rule into force rule from on high i can remove the ball can nt i ask palmer of an official no say the official you must play it where it lie you re wrong say arnold a man who know the rule i ll do a you say but i ll also play a provisional ball and get a rule he score a 4 for the embed ball a 3 with the provisional one the golfing father rule in he favor so he pick up a stroke with the provisional ball and win the tournament by the margin of that stroke until a few week ago however arnold palmer be some god-like creature who have nothing in common with the duffer but after that 12 at los angeles he become one of the boy a big hero than he ever have be before a formula to supply player
