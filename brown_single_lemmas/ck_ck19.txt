there be one fact which rector could not overlook one truth which he could not deny a long a there be two human being work together on the same project there would be competition and you could no more escape it than you could expect to escape the grave no matter how devote a man be no matter how fully he give he life to the lord he could never extinguish that one spark of pride that give he definition a an individual all of the job in the mission might be equal in the eye of the lord but they be certainly not equal in the eye of the lord s servant it be only natural that fletcher would strive for a position in which he could make the decision even rector himself be prey to this spirit of competition and he know it not for a more exalt office in the hierarchy of the church he ambition for the bishopry have die very early in he career but for the one clear victory he have talk about to the colonel he be not sure how much of this desire be due to he devotion to the church and how much be he own ego demand to be satisfy for the two be intertwine and could not be separate he want desperately to see kayabashi defeat the communist in the village root out the mission stand triumphant for in the triumph of the lord he himself would be triumphant too but perhaps this be a part of the eternal plan that man s ambition when link with god would be a drive indefatigable force for good in the world he sigh how foolish it be to try to fathom the truth in an area where only faith would suffice he would have to work without question the motive which make he work and content himself with the think that the eventual victory however it be bring about would be sweet indeed he first move be to send hino to the village to spend a few day he arm have be give he some trouble and rector be not enough of a medical expert to determine whether it have heal improperly or whether hino be simply rebel against the tedious work in the print shop use the stiffness in he arm a an excuse in any event rector send he to the local hospital to have it check tell he to keep he ear open while he be in the village to see if he could find out what kayabashi be plan hino be elate at the prospect he be allow to spend he night at an inn near the hospital and he be give some extra money to go to the pachinko parlor an excellent place to make contact with the enemy he leave with all the joyous spirit of a child go on a holiday nod attentively a rector give he he final instruction he be to get involve in no argument he be to try to make no convert he be simply to listen and report back what he hear it be a ridiculous situation and rector know it for hino frankly partisan openly gregarious would make a poor espionage agent if he want to know anything he would end up ask about it point-blank but in this guileless manner he would probably receive more truthful answer than if he try to get they by indirection in all of he experience in the mission field rector have never see a convert quite like hino from the moment that hino have first walk into the mission to ask for a job any job he qualification neatly write on a piece of paper in a precise hand he have be ready to become a christian he have already be study the bible he know the fundamental and after study with fletcher for a time he approach rector announce that he want to be baptize and that be that rector have never be able to find out much about hino s past hino talk very little about himself except for the infrequent time when he use a personal illustration in connection with another subject put the piece of this mosaic together rector have the vague outline of a biography hino be the fourth son of an elderly farmer who live on the coast in chiba and divide he life between the land and the sea supplement the marginal livelihood on he small rent farm with seasonal employment on a fish boat without exception hino s brother turn to either one or both of they father s occupation but hino show a talent for neither and instead spend most of he time on the beach where he repair net and prove immensely popular a a storyteller he have go into the japanese navy have be train a an officer have participate in one or two battle he never go into detail regard he military experience and at the age of twenty-five quite a a bolt out of the blue he have walk into the mission a if he belong here and have become a christian rector be often curious often tempt to ask question but he never do if and when hino decide to tell he about he experience he would do so unasked rector have no doubt that hino would come back from the village burst with information ready to impart it with he customary gusto liberally embellish with he active imagnation when the telephone ring on the day after hino go down to the village rector have a hunch it would be hino with some morsel of information too important to wait until he return for there be few telephone in the village and the phone in rector s office rarely ring unless it be important he be surprise to find kayabashi s secretary on the other end of the line he be even more startle when he hear what kayabashi want the oyabun be entertain a group of dignitary the secretary say businessman from tokyo for the most part and kayabashi wish to show they the mission they have never see one before and have express a curiosity about it oh rector say i guess it will be all right when would the oyabun like to bring he guest up here this afternoon the secretary say at three oclock if it will be of convenience to you at that time all right rector say i will be expect they he be about to hang up the phone but a note of hesitancy in the secretary s voice leave the conversation open he have something more to say i beg to inquire if the back be now safe for traveler he say rector laugh despite himself unless the oyabun have be work on it he say then check himself and add you can tell kayabashi-san that the back road be in very good condition and will be quite safe for he party to use arigato gosaimasu the secretary sigh with relief and then the telephone click in rector s hand rector have no idea why kayabashi want to visit the mission for the oyabun to make such a trip be either a sign of great weakness or an indication of equally great confidence and from all the available information it be probably the latter kayabashi must feel fairly certain of he victory in order to make a visit like this a trip which could be so easily misinterpret by the people in the village at the same time it be unlikely that any businessman would spend a day in a christian mission out of mere curiosity no kayabashi be bring he associate here for a specific purpose and rector would not be able to fathom it until they arrive when he have give the call a few moment think he go into the kitchen to ask mrs yamata to prepare tea and sushi for the visitor use the formal english china and the silver tea service which have be donate to the mission then he go outside to inspect the ground fujimoto have a pile of cutting near one side of the lawn rector ask he to move it for the time be he want the mission compound to be effortlessly spotless a good initial impression would be important now he go into the print shop where fletcher have just finish clean the press how many pamphlet do we have in stock rector say i should say about a hundred thousand fletcher say why i would like to enact a little tableau this afternoon rector say he explain about the visit and the effect he wish to create the picture of a very busy mission he do not wish to deceive kayabashi exactly just to display the mission activity in a graphic and impressive manner fletcher nod a he listen to the instruction and say he would arrange the thing rector request rector s next stop be at the schoolroom where mavis be monitor a test he beckon to she from the door and she slip quietly outside he tell she of the visitor and then of he plan how many child do you have present today he say she look back toward the schoolroom fifteen she say no only fourteen the little ito girl have have to go home she have a pretty bad cold i would like they to appear very busy today not busy exactly but joyous exuberant full of life i want to create the impression of a compound full of child do you think you can manage it mavis smile i ll try a rector be walk back toward the residential hall johnson come out of the basement and bound up to he the altercation in the coffee house have do little to dampen he spirit but he be still a little wary around rector for they have not yet discuss the incident i think i ve fix the pump so we will nt have to worry about it for a long time he say i ve adjust the gauge so that the pump cut out before the water get too low fine rector say he look out over the expanse of the compound it be go to take a lot of activity to fill it have you ever operate a transit he say no sir johnson say you be about to become a first-class surveyor rector say when konishi get back with the jeep i want you to round up two or three japanese boy konishi can help you you ll find an old transit in the basement the glass be out of it but that will nt matter it look pretty efficient and that s the important thing he go on to explain what he have in mind johnson nod he say he could do it rector be warm to he over-all strategy by the time he get back to the residential hall it be rather a childish game all in all but everybody seem to be get into the spirit of the thing and he could not remember when he have enjoy plan anything quite so much he be not sure what effect it would have but that be really beside the point when you get right down to it he be not go to lose the mission by default and whatever reason kayabashi have for bring he little sight-seeing group to the mission he be go to be in for a surprise he find elizabeth in the parlor and ask she to make sure everything be in order in the residential hall and then to take charge of the office while the party be here when everything have be do rector go back to he desk to occupy himself with he monthly report until three oclock at two thirty he send fujimoto to the top of the wall at the northeast corner of the mission to keep an eye on the ridge road and give a signal when he first glimpse the approach of kayabashi s party then rector attire in he good blue serge suit sit in a chair out on the lawn in the shade of a tree smoke a cigarette and wait the air be cool here and the lacy pattern of the tree throw a dapple shadow on the grass an effect which he find pleasant
