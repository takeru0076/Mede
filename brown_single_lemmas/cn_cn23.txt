he just a he know that she have stop love he the brahmaputra have it headwater in the tableland of the world the tower white headwalls of the himalayas that be unknown to man a any other space on the planet for a brief period each year the ray of the sun be warm enough to melt some of the snow pile a mile deep at the base of the headwalls and then the pinnacle glisten in the daytime at high noon and billions of gallon of water begin they slow seepage under the glacier and across the rockstrewn hang valley on they long meander journey to the sea run east past the sky-carving massif of gurla mandhata and kemchenjunga then turn south and curl down through the jungle of assam past the khasi hill and into bengal past sirinjani and madaripur until the hard water of the melt snow mingle with the soft drainage of field and at length fan out to meld with the teem salt depth of the bay of bengal keith sterling have look down on the brahmaputra more time than he could remember during the war day when he fly over the hump of the world think it high adventure in those time before man be guide himself through outer space but keith look down more than up he think of the jungle below he and of the wild strange untracked beauty there and he promise himself that someday he would return on foot perhaps to hunt in this last corner of the world where man be sometimes himself the hunt and animal the lords at first it have be just a romantic dream of he the same a the idea of finish oxford after the war but after the war be a luxury of a phrase he do not permit himself wing commander in the raf do not imply survival in the future either in they order or in they attitude to they man or to themselves and keith s record of kill make he a man to listen to a man paradoxically who might even survive he become a fighter pilot after the stint over the hump in the big crate the raf be britain s weapon of attrition and fly a fighter plane be the way she son could serve she good at this point in the war he know how to shoot down nazi and he know that the man talk about he behind he back say that he be one up on everybody else include the pilot of the plane with the swastika on it because he be chemically incapable of fear that be true but only half the truth the other half he do nt like to recognize even to himself he enjoy the kill not defend england or be an ace or fight for humanity he enjoy kill and he would have enjoy it just a much if he have be a nazi nowadays we talk a though the blitz be just a short skirmish the nazi bomb britain so the raf retaliate and shoot they all down not quite it be a war of nerve of stamina of dog endurance in which the stupid insistence of the british on they right to they own country become ultimately an unsurmountable obstacle to the nazi who be good organize and technically superior it take a long time before the british tip the balance keith learn too much about air combat and air kill to be risk they ground he over he protest not include he true reason for want to fly and put he in the command office that be where he meet penny he be aware of she a a frightfully good-looking american wac a second lieutenant assign to do the paper work regardless of how important she might have think she be in the command office but that be all penny know he good on she part he have a war reputation but this be the kind of man woman like even without medal they do nt go for bull-like muscle a a rule he have strength in he six-foot frame but it be like the tensile steel in a rapier he be on the thin side with big hand and the kind of wrist that give away the power in forearm and bicep he hair be black already grey at the temple in the classic beauty-idiom the only one permit to a man the pretty little twitter wacs say he have the look of eagle and penny hate the cliche have to admit that in this case it apply keith be an eagle penny and keith have no romance no date or hand-holding but they meet in one sear moment that give they to one another instantly the command office be in the border country up north where the radar system centralize they intelligence report and the fighter be dispatch to harry the enemy the nazi know this of course and while they chief quarry be the industrial center they let a few drop every time they go over hope for a lucky hit this time they have be lucky the command post be underground and well camouflage but there have nt be enough time to build it for keep there be a measure of protection in it concrete wall and ceiling but the engineer who hastily install it be well aware that concrete be not much good than prayer if a efficacious when a direct hit come along this one be actually more of a near miss the bomb plunge into the ground near the post but not precisely into the command room itself there be a shatter crack sound a the concrete start to buckle the air fill with dust and fly debris and everyone in the room man and woman hit the floor and use the desk a turtlebacks a order that be everyone but keith and penny they stand there just the two of they in the rock shatter blast keith be on he foot because he do nt care at all about life any more penny on

paradise for hunter this be the land of the sladang the great water buffalo with horn forty inch across the spread the great black leopard the sambur buck the jungle stag that be even more noble than the scottish elk he even hunt elephant although the asian elephant be not quite a ferocious a he african cousin but there be big rogue in both country these be the one keith seek out the loner the one who kill for the joy of it like himself he and penny would go out on tame elephant raise from babyhood in the keddah and while he be ever alert for game and most particularly a tiger penny marvel at the eden they be traverse they come upon cheetal deer at woodland pool peacock strut across they path preen there be fantastic flower without perfume and gaudy bird without song mouse deer play around
