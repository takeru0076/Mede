if i tell you first of the old one it be in 1814 that abraham wharf and he sister sit by a meager fire in they house on dogtown common a desolate place even then he be sharpen he razor sister say he do you think people who commit suicide go to heaven and she answer i do nt know but i hope you ll never do such a thing without a tremor god forbid he say and go out and cut he throat in the cave near granny day s swamp what have this to do with the present much i assure you you must know what get into people even such a red and handley before you can tell what come out of they they have learn both of they about abraham wharf that s why i beg you not to forget he he ghost be not lay red and handley god help they know the old dogtown lore and i know they know it for i d tell they a lot of it and be nt it true that you get a deep perception about a man and he motive when you know what it be he know yes gentleman i be get to the point to i point you know the fact they be set forth in you own newspaper you want from i the story but a story be about why and then perhaps about how the when you know yesterday morning so what i be try to tell you be the why that be i point and that concern the spirit of the matter there be an inwardness and a luster to old furniture look at that mahogany highboy behind you which have a provocative emanation if i may say so place too have they haunt quality even people and i point in this sad story be the spirit of the matter when you hold the spirit of a thing then somehow you know the truth you know a fake antique from the real thing and the truth be what you ve come for be it not now dogtown be one of those place that creep into the marrow a worm get into old wood under the veneer in fact all the folk who live on the back of cape ann they be not just like other there s a different hall-mark on they there be no witch burning here because everyone have a witch in the family just think of old granther stannard who pull the tooth of dark young she real name be dorcas and because he bungle the job and leave two protrude tusk she put such a hex on he that he think he leg be make of glass after that he be never know to run or even walk fast today dogtown be the only desert village in all new england that i know of there it sit a small highland with town like gloucester near by but now it s the most lose and torture place in the world those who live in that desolation of rocky deformity take on some of the moraine s stony character scientist say it be the last spewings of a great glacier but one rather feel that only a malevolent giant could have pile up those crouch monster of granite which still seem to preserve a sort of suspend ominous life in they we ll walk up there late it s perhaps a mile from here where we sit and not one single dwelling leave there though once in the early eighteenth century there be close to a hundred house i myself have identify about sixty site from the old map and register a fascinate pursuit i assure you even i can remember nothing but ruine cellar and tumble pillar and nobody have live there in the memory of any live man it be now a sweep of boulder and ledge with oak walnut and sumac creep across the common and everywhere the ruin and the long long shadow that s you set and a sinister one please get that in you report it account for so many thing both red mciver and handley walker live nearby almost a near a i do red live at lanesville and from he house he could be up on the common in a half hour s brisk walk handley live far on at pigeon cove i d often find one or other of they up around dogtown sketch they be both painter they be they be what should one say well anyhow dogtown common be so much off the beat track nowadays that only sunday picnicker still stray up there from time to time sea-road railroad lack of water kill dogtown dead dead a a brass door nail and i sometimes feel like the sexton for i m about the last to be even interest i know red and handley well a i say they be both painter they d come separately to gloucester some twenty year ago there s always be an artist colony somewhere on cape ann and each marry here they marry cousin anta and freya norberg there be a lot of scandinavian in this neck of the wood and many still make paint furniture and take steam-bath pretty girl among they with blonde hair and pert face handley marry freya and red of the red beard marry anta and it be because of an old norberg inheritance that i get to understand they all so well the quarrel end in a ridiculous draw but i must tell you about it oh yes i m quite sure it s important because of the beech pasture what s that why that s what give i the feel give i as-it-were the spirit the demoniac evil spirit of this whole affair you see besides be custodian of antiquity i be also registrar no i do nt hold with those who live entirely among dead thing i know a well a the next man that a ship be call from the rig she carry where the live wind blow and not from the hull but you ve get to know both what s below the water-line interest i also a i be say i ve know all about the old record include the old norberg deed some ten year ago that page be tear out i do nt know by whom about five year ago handley come to ask i if he could see the tattered register he be courteous and casual about it a though it be of no consequence he s always like that in spite of be a big man when you see he you ll notice he habit of finger i might almost say stroke a large mole with black hair on it by he right temple a sensual man but very courteous some would say slick like he glossy black hair too many outside manner to i taste he be the sort who with an appraise eye would cross the street to help a strange woman on to a bus and then pinch she a real gentleman i feel would do neither he s always wear a broad-brimmed hat and i ve notice in i small study at the society that he rather smell of cosmetic the next week cousin red wander in a casually but curt and untidy red be small and fine-boned like ivory-inlay he too ask to see the same page when i tell he someone have tear it out he shout by god it s that damn handley the sneak and late in the same week they both come together to examine the register fortunately we be alone in the build so few people nowadays be interest even in they own past or in the lovely craft of other day for they begin to abuse each other in the foul language red thrust out he tawny beard handley glower under he suddenly rumple black hair they actually bristle le rouge et le noir violent man both red always be morose yet that day the dapper handley be the loud of the two but for i presence they would have be at each other throat during the quarrel i learn what the trouble be from the accusation each hurl at the other the beech pasture have suddenly become valuable there s a fine granite quarry there and granite s come back for public building both man know it be in the norberg family holding but to which of the cousin do it belong anta or freya fortunately i know almost exactly what the will have say it begin with a preamble of course this explain that the judge of probate of essex county 1785 or 1786 appoint three free-holders of gloucester to divide and establish the norberg estate after the usual honorable sir it go on to say that there have be set off to the widow one full third part of the real estate of the deceased salu norberg one low room on the western side privilege to the well and bake-oven and to one third of the cellar i can show you the cellar when we go up also one cow right and lastly they set off to the widow she own land that she bring with she a dower namely the beech pasture and i remember that the whole of the privilege not count the beech pasture be value at twenty pound i wish you could have see the crest fall on these two spar coxcombs when i tell they that obviously the pasture belong to they wife jointly that battle scene ridiculous a it be remain in i mind a disturb picture of bad blood to be far heighten with illicit if buccolic color for on a subsequent day i see handley escort anta red s wife up on dogtown common i feel it would be inopportune to disclose i presence not that i intentionally go unperceived but the boulder up there be very high and i be a small woman one other cause of jealousy between they i must tell you paint gloomy and unkempt a red mciver be he be much the good painter i suppose handley know it if red have a show at gloucester handley would hurry to hang he picture in rockport you may say this have little pertinence but gentleman remember that all this prepare i mind alert i intelligence by such touch the pattern take shape you would call these the motive of crime i would call they the pattern of life perhaps even the design of destiny yet with all this knowledge i have nothing of substance to unravel we case a you would call it till yesterday one month ago on the 20th of october be the open of the gun season in massachusetts not much to shoot but there be a few pheasant rabbit too if you care for they which most of the folk around here have nt the sense to appreciate any more than they have the sense to eat mussel that be the day red be say to have go away oh yes he d talk about do so in fact he often disappear from time to time off to paint the sea aboard a dragger out from gloucester anta he wife never seem to mind i suppose these absence give she more clearance for she embrace with cousin handley anyhow i be nt surprise early that morning to see handley himself cross from dogtown common road to the back road no he do nt have he gun which he should have it would have be a good excuse for he be there at all i myself have be up there by seven oclock after mushroom since there d be a week of rain which have stop early that morning and the day be a clear a sandwich glass
