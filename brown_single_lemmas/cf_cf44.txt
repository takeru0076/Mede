in general religious interest seem to exist in all part of the metropolis congregational membership however be another thing a congregation survive only if it can sustain a socially homogeneous membership that be when it can preserve economic integration religious faith can be consider a necessary condition of membership in a congregation since the decision to join a worshiping group require some motive force but faith be not a sufficient condition for join the presence of other member of similar social and economic level be the sufficient condition the breakdown of social homogeneity in inner city area and the spread of inner city blight account for the decline of central city church central city reveal two adverse feature for the major denomination 1 central city tend to be area of residence for low social class 2 central city tend to be more heterogeneous in social composition the central city area in other word exhibit the two characteristic which violate the life principle of congregation of the major denomination they have too few middle-class people they mix middle-class people with lower-class resident central city area have become progressively poor locale for the major denomination since the exodus of middle-class people from most central city with few exception the major denomination be rapidly lose they hold on the central city the key to protestant development therefore be economic integration of the nucleus of the congregation member of high and low social status often cluster around this nucleus so that protestant figure on social class give the impression of spread over all social class but this be deceptive for the core of membership be concentrate in a single social and economic stratum the congregation perish when it be no long possible to replenish that core from the neighborhood moreover residential mobility be so high in metropolitan area that church have to recruit constantly in they core stratum in order to survive they can lose high - and lower-status member from the church without collapse but they need adequate recruit for the core stratum in order to preserve economic integration the congregation be first and foremost an economic peer group it be secondarily a believe and worshiping fellowship if it be primarily a believe fellowship it would recruit believer from all social and economic rank something which most congregation of the new protestantism with a few notable exception have not be able to do they survive only when they can recruit social and economic peer the vulnerability of protestant congregation to social difference have often be attribute to the folksy spirit of protestant religious life in fact a contrast be often draw in this regard with the impersonal roman catholic parish we have see that the folksy spirit be confine to economic peer consequently the vulnerability to social difference should not be attribute to the stress on personal community in protestant congregation actually there be little evidence of such personal community in protestant congregation a we shall see in another connection the vulnerability of protestantism to social difference stem from the peculiar role of the new religious style in middle-class life where the congregation be a vehicle of social and economic group identity and must conform therefore to the principle of economic integration this fact be evident in the recruitment of new member mission a co-optation the rule of economic integration in congregational life can be see in the missionary outreach of the major denomination there be much talk in theological circle about the church a mission and the church s mission theologian have be stress the fact that the church do not exist for it own sake but a a testimony in the world for the healing of the world a crucial question therefore be what evangelism and mission actually mean in metropolitan protestantism if economic integration really shape congregational life then evangelism should be a process of extend economic integration the task of a congregation would be define accord to economic integration a the work of co-opt individual and family of similar social and economic position to replenish the nuclear core of the congregation co-optation mean to choose by joint action in order to fill a vacancy it can also mean the assimilation of center of power from an environment in order to strengthen an organization in a mobile society congregational health depend on a constant process of recruitment this recruitment however must follow the pattern of economic integration or it will disrupt the congregation therefore the recruitment or missionary outreach of the congregation will be co-optation rather than proclamation like element will have to be assimilate evangelism and congregational outreach have not be carefully study in the church one study in pittsburgh however have illuminate the situation in a sample of new member of pittsburgh church almost 60 per cent be recruit by initial contact with friendly member if we add to these contact with friendly member the contact with an organization of the church 112 per cent of the case then a substantial two thirds of all recruitment be through friendly contact on the surface this seem a sound approach to christian mission member of the congregation show by they friendly attitude that they care for new people the new people respond in kind by join the church missionary outreach by friendly contact look somewhat different when one reflect on what be know about friendly contact in metropolitan neighborhood the majority of such contact be with people of similar social and economic position association by level of achievement be the dominant principle of informal relation this mean that the antennae of the congregation be extend into the community pick up the wave length of those who will fit into the social and economic level of the congregation the mission of the church be actually a process of informal co-optation the lie ministry be a mean to recruit like-minded people who will strengthen the social class nucleus of the congregation church can be strengthen through this process of co-optation so long a the environs of the church provide a sufficient pool of people who can fit the pattern of economic integration once the pool of recruit diminish the congregation be helpless friendly contact no long keep it go the transmutation of mission to co-optation be far indicate by the insignificance of educational activity worship preach and publicity in reach new member the proclamation of the church be almost totally confine to pastoral contact by the clergy 173 per cent of new member and friendly contact by member over two thirds if organizational activity be include publicity account for 11 per cent of the initial contact with new member in general friendly contact with a member follow by contact with a clergyman will account for a major share of recruitment by the church make it quite evident that the extension of economic integration through co-optation be the principal form of mission in the contemporary church economic integration and co-optation be the two method by which protestant associate with and recruit from the neighborhood the inner life of congregation will prosper so long a like-minded people of similar social and economic level can fraternize together the outer life of congregation the suitability of the environment to they survival will be propitious so long a the people in the area be of the same social and economic level a the membership economic integration cease when the social and economic statuses in an area become too mix or conflict with the status of the congregation in a rapidly change society congregation will run into difficulty repeatedly since such nice balance of economic integration be hard to sustain in the metropolis for more than a single generation the fact that metropolitan church of the major denomination have move approximately every generation for the last hundred year become somewhat more intelligible in the light of this struggle to maintain economic balance the expense of this type of organization in religious life when one recall the number of city church which deteriorate beyond repair before be abandon raise fundamental question about the principle of protestant survival in a mobile society nonetheless the prevalence of economic integration in congregation illumine the nature of the protestant development it be observe in the introductory chapter that metropolitan life have split into two trend expand interdependence on an impersonal basis and grow exclusiveness in local communal grouping these trend seem to be work at cross-purpose in the metropolis residential association struggle to insulate themselves against intrusion the motif of impersonal interdependence and insulation of residential community have polarize the schism between central city and suburb negro and white blue collar and white collar can be view a symptomatic of this deep polarization of trend in the metropolis it now become evident that the denominational church be intimately involve with the economy of middle-class culture for it serve to crystallize the social class identity of middle-class residential grouping the accelerate pace of metropolitan change have accentuate the drive to conformity in congregation of the major denomination this conformity represent a desperate attempt to stabilize a hopelessly unstable environment more than creature of metropolitan force the church have take the lead in counteract the interdependence of metropolitan life crystallize and perpetuate the stratification of people give form to the struggle for social homogeneity in a world of heterogeneous people since american life be commit above all to productivity and a high standard of economic life the countervailing force of residential and religious exclusiveness have fight a desperate rearguard action against the expand interdependence of the metropolis consumer community have suffer at the hand of the productive interest negroes puerto rican and rural newcomer be slowly make they way into the city soon they will fight they way into the low middle-class suburb and the church will experience the same decay and rebuild cycle which have characterize they history for a century the identification of the basic unit of religious organization the parish or congregation with a residential area be self-defeating in a modern metropolis for it simply mean the close of an iron trap on the outreach of the christian fellowship and the transmutation of mission to co-optation mission to the metropolis contradict survival of the congregation in the residential community because the middle class be fight metropolitan interdependence with residential exclusion this interpretation of the role of residence in the economy of middle-class culture could lead to various projection for the church it could be argue that any fellowship which center in residential neighborhood be doom to become an expression of the panic for stable identity among the middle class it could be argue that only such neighborhood can sustain religious activity since worship presuppose some local stability whatever projection one make the strike fact about congregational and parochial life be the extent to which it be a vehicle of the social identity of middle-class people attention will be give in the next chapter to the style of association in the denominational church this style be characteristically an expression of the communal style of the middle class the keynote of this style be activism and emphasis on achievement in gain self-esteem these value give direction to the life of the middle-class man or woman dictate the method of child rear determine the pattern of community participation set the style for the psychiatric treatment of middle-class illness and inform the congregational life of the major denomination fellowship by likeness and mission by friendly contact form the iron cage of denominational religion it content be another matter for they reveal the kind of interest pursue by the congregation what go on in the cage will occupy we attention under the rubric of the organization church an understand of the new role of residential association in an industrial society serve to illuminate the force which have fashion the iron cage of conformity which imprison the church in they suburban captivity the perplex question still remain a to why the middle class turn to the church a a vehicle of social identity when they club and charity should fill the same need
