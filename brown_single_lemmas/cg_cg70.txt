we often say of a person that he look young for he age or old for he age yet even in the more extreme of such case we seldom go very far astray in guess what he age actually be and this mean i suppose that almost invariably age reveal itself by easily recognizable sign engrave on both the body and the mind young for he age mean only the presence of some minor characteristic not quite usual stigmata quite sufficient for diagnosis be nevertheless there an assumption of youth or the presence of a few youthful characteristic deceive no more successfully than rouge or dye hair look young for you age mean for you age and it mean no more a mind express itself in word may reveal itself a little less obviously a old or young it surface lose it bloom and submit to it wrinkle in way less immediately obvious than the body do youth may be and often be skeptical cynical or despair age may be idealistic believe and much give to profession of optimism but there be nevertheless always a subtle difference in the way in which supposedly similar opinion be hold the pessimism of the young be defiant anxious to confess or even exaggerate it ostensible gloom and so exuberant a to reveal the fact that it regard it ability to face up to the awful truth a more than enough to compensate for the awfulness of that truth similarly the optimism of age protest too much if it proclaim that the good be yet to be it always arouse at least in the young either a suspicious question or perhaps the exclamation of the negro youth who see on a tombstone the inscription i be not dead but sleep boy you ai nt fool nobody but yourself we may say of some unfortunate that they be never young we can not truthfully say of anyone who have succeed in enter deep into he sixties that he be never old those famous line of the greek anthology with which a fade beauty dedicate she mirror at the shrine of a goddess reveal a wise attitude venus take i votive glass since i be not what i be what from this day i shall be venus let i never see no good can come of contemplate the sad inevitable fact that once youth have pass a bad and bad time still succeed the former but there be at least two reason for contemplate one s mind in even a crack mirror one be that there sometimes be real although inadequate compensation in grow old serenity if one be fortunate enough to achieve it be not so good a joy but it be something even to be from hope and fear set free be at least good than to have lose the first without have get rid of the second the other reason and the one with which i be here concern be that one thus become incline to inquire of any opinion or change of opinion whether it represent the wisdom of experience or be only the result of the difference between youth and age which be a inevitable a the all too obvious physical difference one may be exasperatingly aware that if the answer be favorable it will be judge such only by those of one s own age but at least the question have be raise many reader of this department no doubt discount certain of i opinion for the simple reason that they can guess pretty accurately even if they have never actually be tell what i age be at least i should like they to know that i know these discount be be make let i then and in public glance into the mirror i have know some man and woman who say that the self they be tell about or even remember seem utter stranger to they now that they remote past be a discontinuous with they present self a lack in any conscious likeness to they mature personality a the self of a butterfly may be imagine discontinuous with that of the caterpillar it once be for i part i find it difficult to conceive such a state of affair i have change and i have reverse opinion but i be so aware of an uninterrupted continuity of the persona or ego that i see only a absurd the tendency of some psychologist from heraclitus to pirandello and proust to regard consciousness a no more than a flux amid which nothing remain unchanged so far a i be concern the child be unmistakably father to the man despite the obvious fact that child and father differ greatly sometimes for the good and sometimes for the bad fundamental value temperament and the way in which one approach a conviction change less of course than specific opinion that fact be very clearly illustrate in the case of the many present-day intellectual who be communist or near-communists in they youth and be now so extremely conservative or reactionary a many would say that they can define no important political conviction that do not seem so far from even a centrist position a to make the distinction between mr nixon and mr khrushchev for they hardly worth note but in way more fundamental than specific political opinion they be still what they always be passionate sure without a shadow of doubt of whatever it be that they be sure of capable of see black and white only and therefore commit to the logical extreme of whatever it be they be temporarily commit to to those of i reader who find many of i opinion morally or politically or sociologically antiquated and i have reason to know that there be some such i would like to say what i have already hint namely that some of i opinion may indeed be subject to some discount on the simple ground that i be no long young and therefore incapable of be youthful of mind but i will also remind they that i have always be incline to skepticism to a kind of laodicean lack of commitment so far a public affair be concern so that although not a eager a i once be to be disapprove of i can still resist prevail opinion at about the age of twelve i become a spencerian liberal and i have always consider myself a liberal of some kind even though the definition have change repeatedly since spencer become a reactionary several time in i youth i vote the socialist ticket but less because i be socialist than because i be not either a republican or a democrat and i vote for franklin roosevelt every time he be a candidate yet during the year when i be on the staff of the nation i try to the limit the patience of the editor on almost every occasion when i be permit to write an editorial have a bear on a political or social question never once during the try thirties do i come so close to succumb to the private climate of opinion a to grant russian communism even that most weasel-worded of encomium an interest experiment there be few thing of which i be proud than of that unblemished record many of i friend at the time think that i have receive a well-deserved condemnation when lincoln steffens denounce i in a review of one of i book a a perfect example of the obsolete man who could understand and sympathize only with the dead past but he a i can now retort be the man who could see so short a distance ahead that after a visit to russia he give voice to the famous exclamation i have see the future and it work the favorite excuse of those who have now recant they approval of communism be that they do not know how thing would develop with this excuse i have never be much impress there be it seem to i enough in the openly declare principle and intention of russian leader to alienate honorable man without they have to wait to see how it would turn out once many year ago i sit at dinner next to arthur train and the subject of the nation come up he ask i suddenly what be you political opinion well i reply some of i colleague on the paper regard i a a rank reactionary after a moment s think he reply that still leave you a lot of latitude and i suppose it do i never have be and be not now any kind of utopian when i first come across samuel johnson s pronouncement the remedy for the ill of life be palliative rather than radical it seem to i to sum up the profound of political and social truth it will probably explain more of i attitude toward society than any other phrase or principle could why do i choose to fill these page in this particular issue with this mixture of rather tenuous reflection and autobiography the reason be i think i awareness that i remark last quarter on pacifism may well have serve to confirm the opinion of some that i tendency to skepticism and dissent get we nowhere and that i be simply too old to hope i would however like to suggest that wrong though i may be the tendency to see dilemma rather than solution be one of which i have be a victim ever since i can remember and therefore not merely a senile phenomenon i know that one must act but one need not always be sure that the action be either wise or conclusive apropos of what some would call cynicism i remember an anecdote the source of which i forget it concern a small-town minister who stage an impressive object lesson by confine a lion and a lamb together in the same cage outside he church door not only he parishioner but the whole town and ultimately the whole county be enormously impress by this object lesson one day he be visit by a delegation of would-be imitator who want to know he secret how on earth do you manage it what be the trick why he reply it be perfectly simple there be no trick involve all you have to do be put in a fresh lamb from time to time cynical blasphemous not really it seem to i the promise that the lion and the lamb will lie down together be give in the future tense it be not something that can be expect to happen now without really change the general subject i take this opportunity to confess that i be trouble by doubt not only about pacifism but also when ask to join in the protest against a law that most of those who consider themselves humane and liberal seem to regard a obviously barbarous namely the law that prescribe the death penalty for murder when there seem to be no extenuate circumstance it be not that i be unaware of the force of they strong contention life they say should be regard a sacred and therefore a something that neither an individual nor he society have a right to take away in fact i can not imagine myself condemn a man to the noose or the electric chair if i have to take a an individual the responsibility for he death just a i know i would make a bad soldier even though i can not sincerely call myself a pacifist so too i would not be either a hangman by profession or if i could avoid it even a member of a hang jury despite these fact the question should no murderer ever be execute seem to i to create a dilemma not to be satisfactorily dispose of by a simple negative answer punishment of the wrongdoer so liberal be incline to say can have only three possible justification revenge reformation or deterrent example
