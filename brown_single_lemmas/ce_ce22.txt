witty mercurial full of prank and bonheur and very capable a a professional musician these quality endear he to both the musician and the social-economic haute monde which support the concert world of the post-world war 1 era prokofieff s outlook a a composer-pianist-conductor in america be indeed brilliant prokofieff s classical symphony be hail a an ingenious work from a naturally gift and well-trained musician still in he twenties to the traditionalist it be a brilliant satire on modernism to the neo-classicist it be a challenge to the pre-war world what be it to prokofieff a tongue-in-cheek stylization of 18th-century idea a trial balloon to test the aesthetic climate of the time a brilliant piece de resistance certainly it composer be an ascend star on a new world horizon i hear the classical symphony for the first time when koussevitzky conduct it in paris in 1927 all musical paris be there some musician be enthusiastic some skeptical i myself be one of the skeptics 35 year ago i remember erne bloch in the foyer shout in he high-pitched voice it may be a tour de force mais mon dieu can anyone take this music seriously the answer be yes certainly america take prokofieff and he classical symphony seriously and with a good deal of pleasure he life-long friend serge koussevitzky give unreservedly of he praise and brilliant performance in boston new york and washington dc to which he add broadcastings and recording for the whole nation chicago be also a welcome host there in 1921 prokofieff conduct the world premiere of the love for three orange and play the first performance of he third piano concerto uncle sam be indeed a rich uncle to prokofieff in those opulent post-war victory year of peace and prosperity bold speculation and extravaganza enjoyment and pleasure the golden twenties we attend the premiere of he concerto symphony and suite we study teach and perform he piano sonata chamber music gavotte and march we buy he record and play they in we school and university we unanimously agree that prokofieff have win he right a a world citizen to the first rank of twentieth-century composer nevertheless prokofieff be much influence by paris during the twenties the paris which be the artistic center of the western world the social paris to which russian aristocracy migrate the chic paris which attract the tourist dollar of rich america the avant-garde paris of diaghileff stravinsky koussevitzky cocteau picasso the laissez-faire paris of dadaism and ultramodern art the paris sympathique which take young composer to she bosom with such quick and easy enthusiasm so young prokofieff be the darling of success in he motherland in the spacious hunt ground of uncle sam in the exciting salon of he lovely brilliant paris mistress of gaiety excess and abandon world theatre of new-found freedom in tone color dance design and think meanwhile three great terrible force be coagulate and crystallize in this world-wide conscription of man mind and machine prokofieff be recall to he native land the world explode when fascism challenge all concept of peace and liberty and the outraged freedom-loving people of the capitalist and socialist world combine force to stamp fascist tyranny into cringe submission after this holocaust a change world occupy the mind of man a world beset with new boundary new treaty and government new goal and method and the age-old fear of aggression and subjugation hunger and exposure in this change world prokofieff settle to find himself and to create for large national purpose here this happy roving son of good fortune prove that he could accept the discipline of a new social-economic order fight for it very existence and ideal in a truculent world here prokofieff become a workman in the vineyard of socialism produce music for the mass it be at this point in he life that the mature prokofieff emerge one might have expect that such a violent epoch of transition would have destroy the creative flair of a composer especially one whose work be so fluent and spontaneous but no prokofieff grow he accept the environment of he destiny take root and grow to fulfill the stature of he early promise by 1937 he have clarify he intention to serve he people i have strive for clarity and melodious idiom but at the same time i have by no mean attempt to restrict myself to the accept method of harmony and melody this be precisely what make lucid straightforward music so difficult to compose the clarity must be new not old how right he be how clearly he see the cultural defection of experimentation a an escape for those who dare not or prefer not to face the discipline of modern traditionalism and with what resource do prokofieff back up he credo of word with torrent of powerful music compare the vast difference in scope and beauty between he neat and witty little classical symphony and he big muscular passionate and eloquent fifth symphony or the love for three orange gay a it be with the wonderful imaginative colorful and subtle tenderness of the magnificent ballet the stone flower this masterpiece have gaiety too but it be the gaiety of dance people earthy salty and humorous of course these work be not comparable even though the same brain conceive they the early work be conceive for a sophisticate international audience the late work be conceive to affirm a way of life for fellow citizen however in all of prokofieff s music young or mature we find he profile he signature he craftsman s attitude prokofieff never forsake he medium for the cause of experimentation per se in orchestration he stretch the limit of instrumentation with good judgment and a fine imagination for color he sense for rhythmic variety and time be impeccable he creative development of melodic design of slavic dance tune and love song be captivate witty clever adroit and subtle he counterpoint be pertinent skillful and rarely thick also it should be note that the polytonal freedom of he melody and harmonic modulation the brilliant orchestration the adroitness for evade the heaviness of figure bass the skill in florid counterpoint be not lose in he mature output even in the spectacular historical drama of the stage and cinema where a large dramatic canvas of sound be require that prokofieff s harmony and form sometimes seem professionally routine to we ear may or may not indicate that he be less of an original than we prefer to believe need for novelty may be a symptom of cultural fatigue and instability prokofieff might well emerge a a cultural hero who by the force of he creative life help preserve the main stream of tradition to which the survive idiom of current experimentalism may be eventually add and integrate at this date it seem probable that the name of serge prokofieff will appear in the archive of history a an effective traditionalist who be fully aware of the lure and danger of experimentation and use it a it serve he purpose yet be never catch up in it never a slave to it academic dialectic certainly it be the traditional clarity of he music which have endear he to the western world not he experimentation so prokofieff be able to cultivate he musical talent and harvest a rich reward from they nor can anyone be certain that prokofieff would have do good or even a well under different circumstance he fellow-countryman igor stravinsky certainly do not why do prokofieff expand in stature and fecundity while stravinsky who leap into fame like a young giant dwindle in stature and fruitfulness i think the answer be to be find in prokofieff s own word the clarity must be new not old when prokofieff forge he new clarity of lucid straightforward music so difficult to compose he shape he talent to he purpose when stravinsky shape he purpose to the shift scene of many culture many salon many dialectic many personality he try to refashion himself into a stylist of many style determine by many disparate culture prokofieff be guide in a consistent direction by the life of he own people by the compass of they national idea but stravinsky be sway by the attitude of whatever culture he be reflect in all he miscalculation stravinsky make the fatal historical blunder of presume that he could transform other composer inspiration represent many people time period and style into he own music by warp the harmony melody or form to verify he own experiment because of the authentic homogeneity of he early nationalistic material and he flair for orchestration he brilliant petruchka he savage sacre do printemps he incisive les noces the world keep hope that he could recapture the historical direction for which he native talent be predispose but time be run out and many of stravinsky s admirer begin to fear that he will never find terra firma he various aesthetic postulate remain a landmark of a house divide against itself supra-expressionism neo-paganism neo-classicism neo-romanticism neo-jazz neo-ecclesiasticism neo-popularism and most recently post-serialism all compete with each other within one composer what a patchwork of proclamation and renunciation meager and shabby by-product linger to haunt we memory of a once mighty protagonist a maladroit reharmonization of we national anthem the star-spangled banner a poor attempt to write an idiomatic jazz concerto a circus polka for elephant he hope that the tune from he old music might be use for popular american commercial song stravinsky near the age of eighty be like a lose and frantic bird flit from one abandon nest to another search for a home how differently prokofieff s life unfold prokofieff be able to adjust he creative personality to a swiftly change world without lose he particular force and direction in the process he native endowment be stretch strengthen and discipline to serve they human purpose with a large and circumspect 20th-century technique he weave the material of national hero and event national folklore and child s fairy tale slavic dance and love song into a solid musical literature which serve he people well and be provide much enjoyment to the world at large of course it must not be forget that in achieve this historical feat prokofieff have the vast resource of he people behind he time and economic security symphony orchestra opera and ballet company chorus chamber music ensemble soloist recording broadcastings television large and eager audience it must be concede that he native land provide prokofieff with many of the necessary condition for great creative incentive economic security and cultural opportunity incisive idiom social fermentations for a new national ideology a sympathetic public and a large body of performer especially train to fulfill he purpose thus in prokofieff the union of soviet socialist republic produce one of the great composer of the twentieth century that he mood even in he early year be those of he people do he honor a he music honor those who inspire it that he master every aspect of he medium accord to he own great talent and contemporary judgment be a good and solid symbol of he people under the tremendous pressure of proclaim and practise the rigor of a new culture and perhaps of even great significance he music be strong 20th-century evidence of the effectiveness of evolution base on a
