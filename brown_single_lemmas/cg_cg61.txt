the turn of the century or to be more precise the two decade preceed and follow it mark a great change in the history of early english scholarship at the bottom of this change be great stride forward in the technical equipment and technical standard of the historian in archaeology for example the contribution of frederick haverfield and reginald smith to the various volume of the victoria county history raise the discipline from the status of an antiquarian pastime to that of the most valuable single tool of the early english historian and with the publication of et leed archaeology of the anglo-saxon settlement the student be present with an organize synthesis of the archaeological data then know what be true for archaeology be also true of place-name study the value of place-name in the reconstruction of early english history have long be recognize place-name in fact have be extensively utilize for this purpose from the time of camden onwards without a precise knowledge of germanic philology however it be debatable whether they use be not more often a source of confusion and error than anything else even in the nineteenth century such accomplish philologist a kemble and guest be lead into what now seem ludicrous error because of they failure to recognize that modern form of place name be not necessarily the result of logical philological development it be therefore not until the publication of jh round s the settlement of the south and east saxon and wh stevenson s dr guest and the english conquest of south britain that a scientific basis for place-name study be establish diplomatic be another area for which the dawn of the twentieth century mark the begin of modern standard of scholarship although because of the important achievement of nineteenth century scholar in the field of textual criticism the advance be not so strike a it be in the case of archaeology and place-name the editorial principle lay down by stevenson in he great edition of asser and in he crawford charter be a distinct improvement upon those of he predecessor and remain unimproved upon today in sum it can be say that the technique and standard of present day have they origin at the turn of the century and it be this particularly the establishment of archaeology and place-name study on a scientific basis which be immediately pertinent to the saxon shore almost inevitably the first result of this technological revolution be a reaction against the method and in many case the conclusion of the oxford school of stubbs freeman and particularly green regard the nature of the anglo-saxon conquest of britain even before the century be out the tide of reaction have set in charles plummer in the introduction and note to he splendid edition of bede voice some early doubt concern the elaborate superstructure they raise up over the slim foundation afford by the traditional narrative of the conquest it be plummer in fact who coin the much quote remark mr green indeed write a if he have be present at the land of the saxon and have watch every step of they subsequent progress sir henry howorth write in 1898 put himself firmly in the lappenburg-kemble tradition by attack the veracity of the west saxon annal early in the present century wh stevenson continue the attack with a savage article against guest follow he in vary degree of scepticism be tw shore hm chadwick thoma hodgkin and fg beck by 1913 ferdinand lot could begin an article subtitle la conquete de la grande-bretagne par les saxon with the word il est difficile aujourdhui dentretenir des illusion sur la valeur do recit traditionnel de la conquete de la grande-bretagne it be also worthy of note that lot cite both kemble and lappenberg with favor in that article it would seem that the wheel have turn full circle in fact modern scholarly opinion in the main have not retreat all the way back to the destructive scepticism of the first half of the nineteenth century although one meet with occasional extremist like zachrisson or very recently arthur wade-evans the majority of scholar have take a middle position between the extreme of scepticism and gullibility most now admit that bede gildas nennius and the anglo-saxon chronicle can not be the infallible guide to early english history that guest freeman and green think they to be a rh hodgkin have remark the critical method of the nineteenth century shatter most of this picturesque narrative on the other hand the consensus of opinion be that use with caution and in conjunction with other type of evidence the native source still provide a valid rough outline for the english settlement of southern britain a sir charles oman once say it be no long fashionable to declare that we can say nothing certain about old english origin therefore in one way kemble and lappenberg have be vindicate they conclusion concern the untrustworthiness of the west saxon annal the confuse chronology of bede the unreliability of the early position of the anglo-saxon genealogy and the mythological element contain in nennius be now mostly accept nevertheless in another way modern historian still labor in the vineyard of the oxford school for it be they catastrophic concept of the anglo-saxon invasion rather than kemble s gradualist approach which dominate the field despite the rejection of the traditional account on many point of detail a late a 1948 it be still possible to postulate a massive and comparatively sudden begin in can 450 influx of german a the type of invasion at this point of course the issue have become complicate by a development unforeseen by lappenberg and kemble they however much they be in disagreement with the late victorian over the method by which britain be germanized agree with they that the end result be the complete extinction of the previous celtic population and civilization but begin for all practical purpose with frederick seebohm s english village community scholar have have to reckon with a theory involve institutional and agrarian continuity between roman and anglo-saxon time which be completely at odds with the reign concept of the anglo-saxon invasion against seebohm formidable foe have take the field notably fw maitland whose domesday book and beyond be write expressly for this purpose and sir paul vinogradoff whose the growth of the manor have a similar aim largely due to they effort the catastrophic invasion-theory have maintain it position although seebohm have always find supporter hl gray in he english field system and zachrisson s roman kelt and saxon defend in part the seebohm thesis while at the present time hpr finberg and gordon copley seem to fall into the celtic survivalist camp this be nevertheless a minority view most scholar while will to accept a survival revival of celtic art form and a considerable proportion of the celtic population reject any institutional legacy from pre-anglo-saxon britain therefore it be plain that the clear distinction of the nineteenth century be no long with we in the main stream of historical think be a group of scholar hm chadwick rh hodgkin sir frank stenton et al who be in vary degree sceptical of the native tradition of the conquest but who defend the catastrophic type of invasion suggest by they they in effect have compromise the oppose position of the nineteenth century on the other side be the celtic survivalist who have take a tack divergent from both these school of nineteenth century think a a group they should be favorable to a concept of gradual germanic infiltration although the specialist nature of much of they work eg seebohm gray and finberg tend to obscure they sympathy those who do have occasion to deal with the invasion in a more general way like tw shore and arthur wade-evans be on the side of a gradual and often peaceful germanic penetration into britain wade-evans in fact deny that there be any anglo-saxon invasion at all other than a minor jutish foray in ad 514 now omit for a moment some recent development we can say the saxon shore hypothesis of lappenberg and kemble have undergo virtual eclipse in this century it be no long possible to say that a sceptical attitude towards the receive account of the invasion almost automatically produce a shore occupy by interpretation everyone be more or less sceptical and virtually no one have be will to accept lappenberg or kemble s position on that point one reason be of course that the new scepticism have be will to maintain the general picture of the invasion a portray in the traditional source the few scholar who have adopt the shore occupy by interpretation howorth shore and wade-evans have all be celtic survivalist moreover they have do so in rather special circumstance the primary reason for the abandonment of the shore occupy by thesis have be the assimilation and accumulation of archaeological evidence the most strike feature of early english study in this century again omit recent development et leed dictum of 1913 have stand unchallenged so far a archaeology be concern there be not the least warrant for the second shore occupy by of these theory even early haverfield have come to the same conclusion what they mean be that there be no evidence to show that the south and east coast of britain receive germanic settler conspicuously early than some other part of england that be there be no trace of anglo-saxon in britain a early a the late third century to which time the archaeological evidence for the erection of the saxon shore fort be begin to point in the face of a clear judgment from archaeology therefore it become impossible for a time for scholar to re-adopt the shore settle by theory in recent year however a wind of change seem to be blow through early english historical circle the great increase in the amount of archaeological activity and therefore information in the year immediately preceed and follow the second world war have bring to light data which have change the complection of the saxon shore dispute where there be none fifteen year ago several scholar currently be edge they way cautiously towards the acceptance of the shore occupy by position we must therefore have a look at the new archaeological material and re-examine the literary and place-name evidence which bear upon the problem what exactly be we try to prove we know that the saxon shore be a phenonenon of late roman defensive policy in other word it existence belong to the period of roman britain so whenever the roman finally withdraw from the island the saxon shore disappear in the first decade of the fifth century we also know that the saxon shore a reflect in the notitia be create a a part of the theodosian reorganization of britain post ad 369 i argument be that there be no saxon shore prior to that time even though the fort have be in existence since the time of carausius therefore what we must prove or disprove be that there be saxon in the broad sense in which we must construe the word in the area of the saxon shore at the time it be call the saxon shore that be we must find saxon in east anglia kent sussex and hampshire in the last half of the fourth century the problem in other word be strictly a chronological one in gaul the saxon element on it saxon shore be plainly visible because there the saxon be an intrusive element in the population in britain obviously the archaeological and place-name characteristic of the saxon shore region be bind to be saxon it be a matter of try to sort out an early fourth-century saxon element from the late fifth-century mainstream of anglo-saxon invasion this naturally will be difficult to do since both the archaeological and place-name evidence in this period with some fortunate exception be insufficient for precise chronological purpose it might be well to consider the literary evidence first because it can provide we with an answer to one important question namely be the idea that there be saxon mercenary in england at all reasonable
