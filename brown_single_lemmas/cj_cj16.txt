purification of the conjugate in attempt to improve specificity of stain the fluorescein-labeled antisera use in both direct and indirect method be treat in one of several way 1 they be pass through dowex-2-chloride twice and treat with acetone insoluble powder coon 1958 prepare from mouse liver or from healthy sweet clover stem or crown gall tissue produce by agrobacterium tumefaciens ef smith & townsend on sweet clover stem 2 the conjugate a well a the intermediate sera be absorb for 30 minute with 20 - 50 mg of protein extract from healthy sweet clover stem the protein be extract with 3 volume of afj in afj to give a nearly neutral extract and precipitate by 80 % saturation with afj the precipitate be wash twice with an 80 % saturate solution of afj dissolve in a small quantity of 01 m neutral phosphate buffer dialyzed against cold distil water till free from ammonium ion and lyophilized use liquid nitrogen 3 in other experiment the indirect conjugate be treat with 3 volume of ethyl acetate a recommend by dineen and ade 1957 4 the conjugate be pass through a diethylaminoethyl deae cellulose column equilibrate with neutral phosphate buffer pbs contain afj potassium phosphate and afj preparation of freeze section the technique of cut section be essentially the same a that describe by coon et al 1951 root and stem tumor from sweet clover plant infect with wtv be quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen embed in ice and cut at 3 - 6 \*\* ym in a cryostat maintain at -16-degrees to -20-degrees the section be mount on cold slide smear with haupts adhesive johansen 1940 in early experiment and in late experiment with a different mixture of the same component report by schramm and rottger 1959 the latter adhesive be find to be much more satisfactory the section be then thaw by place a finger under the slide and dry under a fan for 30 minute until use they be store for a long a 2 week stain technique indirect method the section be fix in acetone for 15 minute and dry at 37-degrees for 30 minute some of they be then cover with a drop of afj in a moist chamber at 24-degrees for 30 - 40 minute a control other section be similarly cover with afj section be then wash with pbs for 15 - 30 minute after blot out most of the saline around the section a drop of afj be layer over each of the section allow to react for 30 minute and then wash with pbs for 15 - 30 minute after blot out most of the liquid around the section the latter be mount in buffer glycerine 7 part glycerine to 3 part of pbs direct method after dry the section under the fan fix in acetone and dry at 37-degrees a in the indirect method the section be treat with conjugate afj or afj undiluted unless mention otherwise for 5 - 30 minute a control other section be similarly treat with afj or conjugate antiserum to the new york strain of potato yellow-dwarf virus wolcyrz and black 1956 the section be then wash with pbs for 15 - 30 minute and mount in buffer glycerine fluorescence microscopy stain or unstained section be examine under dark field illumination in a zeiss fluorescence microscope equip with a mercury vapor lamp osram hbo 200 the light beam from the lamp be filter through a half-standard thickness corn 1840 filter in the eyepiece a wratten 2 b filter be use to filter off residual ultra-violet light a red filter zeiss barrier filter with the code schott designation bg 23 be also use in the ocular lens assembly a it improve the contrast between specific and nonspecific fluorescence result specificity of stain indirect method in the first few experiment afj be pass through dowex-2-chloride twice and absorb twice with 50 - 100 mg sweet clover tissue powder the intermediate sera be also similarly absorb with tissue powder section of sweet clover stem and root tumor be treat with 1 10 solution of afj for 30 minute wash in buffer saline for 15 minute stain with afj for 30 minute and wash for 15 minute in afj such section show bright yellow-green specific fluorescence in the cell of the pseudophloem tissue lee and black 1955 this specific fluorescence be readily distinguish from the light green nonspecific fluorescence in consecutive section stain with 1 10 dilution of ns and afj or with afj alone unstained section mount in buffer glycerine or section treat only with ns or afj do not show such green fluorescence section of crown gall tissue similarly stain with either afj and afj or ns and afj also show only the light green nonspecific fluorescence however the nonspecific stain by the afj in tumor section be consider bright enough to be confuse with the stain of small amount of wtv antigen two absorption of afj with ethyl acetate or two absorption of afj which have be pass through dowex-2-chloride ns and afj with crown gall tissue powder or mouse liver powder do not far improve the specificity of stain treatment of all the sera with sweet clover protein greatly reduce nonspecific fluorescence especially when the treat conjugate be dilute to 1 2 with 085 % saline in all the above procedure when the intermediate sera be dilute to 1 10 or 1 100 with 085 % saline the specific and nonspecific fluorescence be not appreciably reduce whereas a dilution of the intermediate sera to 1 500 or dilute the afj to 1 5 greatly reduce specific fluorescence rinse the section with pbs before layer the intermediate sera do not improve the stain reaction in addition to other treatment treat the section with normal sheep serum for half an hour before layer afj do not reduce nonspecific stain the only treatment by which nonspecific stain could be satisfactorily remove be by pass the conjugate through a deae-cellulose column when 1 ml of conjugate be pass through a column afj the first and second milliliter fraction collect be the most specific and give no nonspecific stain in some experiment and very little in other in the latter case an additional treatment of the deae-cellulose-treated afj with 50 mg of sweet clover stem tissue powder far improve the specificity after these treatment the conjugate do not stain healthy or crown gall sweet clover tissue or stain they a very faint green which be easily distinguishable from the bright yellow-green specific stain with this purify conjugate the good stain procedure consist of treat the section with 1 10 dilution of afj for 30 minute wash with pbs for 15 minute stain with afj for 30 minute and wash with pbs for 15 minute the specificity of stain in wtv tumor with afj and afj but not with ns and afj or with antiserum to potato yellow-dwarf virus and afj and the absence of such stain in crown gall tumor tissue from sweet-clover indicate that an antigen of wtv be be stain direct method afj be first conjugate with 50 mg of fitc per gram of globulin this conjugate be pass twice through dowex-2-chloride and treat with various tissue powder in the same manner a describe for the indirect method in all case a disturb amount of nonspecific stain be still present although it be still distinguishable from specific fluorescence in late experiment afj and afj be prepare by conjugate 8 mg of fitc per gram of globulin these conjugate afj have much less nonspecific stain than the previous conjugate with 50 mg fitc per gram of globulin while the specific stain be similar in both case nonspecific stain could be satisfactorily eliminate by pass these conjugate through a deae-cellulose column a describe for afj the good stain procedure with this purify afj consist of stain with the conjugate for 30 minute and wash in pbs for 15 minute the specificity of stain with afj be establish a follow afj specifically stain tumor section but not section of healthy sweet clover stem or of crown gall tumor tissue from sweet clover section of tumor incited by wtv be not similarly stain with conjugate normal serum or conjugate antiserum to potato yellow-dwarf virus after pass afj through deae-cellulose the titer of antibody to wtv in the specific fraction be 1 4 of the titer before such passage precipitin ring test by rf whitcomb but mere dilution of the conjugate to 1 4 do not satisfactorily remove nonspecific stain this indicate that increase in specificity of afj after pass it through deae-cellulose be not merely due to dilution specific stain by deae-cellulose treat afj and afj although clearly distinguishable under the microscope from either nonspecific stain or autofluorescence of cell be not satisfactorily photograph to show such difference in spite of many attempt with black and white and color photography this be chiefly because of the bluish white autofluorescence from the cell the autofluorescence from the wall of the xylem cell be particularly brilliant distribution of virus antigen result of specific stain by the direct and the indirect method be similar and show the localization of wtv antigen in certain tissue of tumor the virus antigen be concentrate in the pseudophloem tissue frequently a few isolate thick-walled cell or rarely group of such cell in the xylem region be also specifically stain but there be no such stain in epidermis cortex most xylem cell ray cell or pith within the pseudophloem cell the distribution of wtv antigen be irregular in the cytoplasm no antigen be detectable in certain dark spherical area in most cell these area be think to represent the nucleus in some tumor section small spherical body possibly inclusion body littau and black 1952 stain more intensely than the rest of cytoplasm and probably contain more antigen in all case study tissue of the stem on which the tumor have develop do not contain detectable amount of wtv antigen discussion in both the direct and indirect method of stain the conjugate have nonspecifically stain fraction in the indirect method this be evident from the fact that tumor section be stain light green even when stain with ns and afj or with afj only in the direct method afj not far treat stain certain tissue of healthy sweet clover stem nonspecifically and wtv tumor section be similarly stain by comparable afj after afj and afj be pass through dowex-2-chloride twice and treat twice with healthy sweet clover tissue powder nonspecific stain be greatly reduce but a disturb amount of such stain be still present treatment of the conjugate with ethyl acetate and the conjugate which have be pass through dowex-2-chloride with mouse liver powder sweet clover crown gall tissue powder or healthy sweet clover protein do not satisfactorily remove nonspecifically stain substance in the conjugate such treatment of the conjugate have usually be successful in eliminate nonspecific stain in several other system coon 1958 schramm and rottger 1959 do not report any such nonspecific stain of plant tissue with fluorescein isocyanate-labeled antiserum to tobacco mosaic virus the reason for the failure of these treatment to eliminate nonspecific stain in the conjugate in we system be not know in we work the good procedure for remove substance cause nonspecific stain in order to obtain specific conjugate be to pass the conjugate through a deae-cellulose column and in some case to absorb the first and second milliliter fraction with sweet clover tissue powder the specific stain by both direct and indirect method show that wtv antigen be concentrate in the pseudophloem tissue and in a few thick-walled cell in the xylem region but be not detectable in any other tissue of the root and stem tumor a study of the distribution of wtv antigen within the pseudophloem cell indicate that it be irregularly distribute in the cytoplasm wound-tumor virus be a leafhopper transmit virus not easily transmissible by mechanical inoculation black 1944 brakke et al 1954 the concentration and apparent localization of the wtv antigen in pseudophloem tissue of the tumor may indicate that the virus preferentially multiply in the phloem and may need to be directly place in this tissue in order to infect plant
