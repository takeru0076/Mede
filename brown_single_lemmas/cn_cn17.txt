fun one i ll bet it be fun for i all right i do nt mean to pry but do they hide the swimsuit with the bubble i mean be advertise honest it depend on who do it i never wear anything at all it would nt would nt seem fair somehow i could nt agree with you more i really do have something important to tell you mr scott about the murder murder oh yeah i say tell i about the murder she tell i ze be the creation of two man louis thor and bill blake partner in ze inc they d peddle the soap virtually alone and without much success until about a year ago when with the addition of sx-21 to they secret formula and the inauguration of a high-power advertise campaign sales have soar practically into orbit they product have be endorse by good housekeeping the ama and the veterinary journal among other repository of high wisdom and before much long if you do nt have a cake of they soap in the john even you good friend would think you do nt bathe i lovely caller joyce holland be she name have previously do three film commercial for ze and this even the fourth a super production have be film at the home of louis thor the water in thor s big swim pool have be cover with a blanket of thick foamy soapsuds fashion of course from ze joyce have dive from the board into the pool then swirl and cavort in she luxurious bath while camera roll the finish and drastically cut product would begin with a hazy longshot of joyce enter the sud then burst above the pool s surface clad in layer of lavender lather and i have a hunch this item be go to sell ton and ton of soap even to clean man and boy joyce go on when we d finish lou mr thor ask i to stay a little long he want a few still for magazine ad he say everybody leave and i stay in the pool then lou come back alone and leap into the pool too and he do nt have any clothe on he do nt yes he do nt do i mean she pause do leap into the pool and do nt have anything on anyway it be evident what he have in mind you get away do nt you yes he catch up with i once and grab i but i be all cover with ze it s very slippery you know i do nt know i would nt have the stuff in the house but i m please to hear so i just scoot out of he clutch i swim like mad get out of the pool grab i robe and run to the car the key be still in it and i be mile away before i remember that i clothe and purse and everything be still in the little cabana where i d change she d drive around for a while joyce say then think louis thor would have calm down by that time she d go back to he home on bryn mawr drive park in front and walk toward the pool while several yard from it still conceal by the shrubbery she d see two man on she leave at the pool s edge she go on a man be hold onto lou hold he up maybe lou be only unconscious but right then i think he must be dead the man shove he into the water then run past the cabana there s a walk there that go out to quebec drive i be so scare well i just run to i car and come here you know who the other man be no i never do see he face i do nt get a good look at he at all he back be to i and i be so scare it be just somebody in a man s suit but i m sure the other one be lou what joyce want i to do be go to thor s house and do whatever detective do and get she clothe and handbag contain she identification she realize i d have to notify the police but fervently hope i could avoid mention she name she impact in the ze commercial have lead to she be consider for an excellent part in an upcoming tv series underwater western eye a documentary-type show to be sponsor by oatnut grit but if joyce get involve in murder or salacious scandal the role would probably go to the sponsor s wife mrs oatnut grit or at least not to joyce and i so want the part she say the commercial have just be for money there have nt be any real incentive for i to do they but in underwater western eye i d have a chance to act i could show what i can do a far a i be concern she have already and have dandily show what she could do but i promise joyce i would mention she name if at all only a a last resort seem much relieve she smile one of those worth-waiting-for smile and i smile all the way into the bedroom there i get i colt special and shoulder harness slip i coat on and go back into the front room joyce squirm a little on the divan i m start to itch she say itch yes i m still all cover with that soap i be load with sud when i run away and i have nt have a chance to wash it off mmmm it sure itch you might a well wait here while i m go so you can use i shower if you d like oh i d love to i show she the

one of i virtue or vice be a sort of three-dimensional imagination complete with sound effect and glorious live color soak a long a you want joyce it ll probably be at least an hour or two before i can check back with you so you ll have everything all to yourself doggone i look at i watch ten after nine time to go i suppose well goodbye i say goodbye you d good hurry oh you can count on that she smile slightly softly warmly do nt hurry too much i ll be soak for at least half an hour that be all she say but suddenly those hot-honey eye seem to have everything but swarm of bee in they however when there s a job to be do i m a monstrosity of grim determination i like to think i spin about and clatter through the front room to the door a i go out i could hear water pour in the shower hot water she would nt be take a cold shower hell she could nt bryn mawr drive be only two or three mile from the spartan and it take i less than five minute to get there but the scene be not the quiet
