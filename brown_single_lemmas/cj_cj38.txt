unemployed old worker who have no expectation of secure employment in the occupation in which they be skilled should be able to secure counseling and retrain in an occupation with a future some vocational train school provide such train but the current need exceed the facility current program the present federal program of vocational education begin in 1917 with the passage of the smith-hughes act which provide a continue annual appropriation of $ 7 million to support on a match basis state-administered program of vocational education in agriculture trade industrial skill and home economics since 1917 some thirteen supplementary and relate act have extend this federal program the george-barden act of 1946 raise the previous increase in annual authorization to $ 29 million in addition to the $ 7 million under the smith act the health amendment act of 1956 add $ 5 million for practical nurse train the late major change in this program be introduce by the national defense education act of 1958 title 8 of which amend the george-barden act annual authorization of $ 15 million be add for area vocational education program that meet national defense need for highly skilled technician the federal program of vocational education merely provide financial aid to encourage the establishment of vocational education program in public school the initiative administration and control remain primarily with the local school district even the state remain primarily in an assist role provide leadership and teacher train federal assistance be limit to half of the total expenditure and the state or local district must pay at least half the state may decide to encourage local program by pay half of the cost or the state may require the local district to bear this half or some part of it throughout the history of the program state government expenditure in the aggregate have usually match or exceed the federal expenditure while local district all together have spend more than either federal or state government today federal fund account for only one-fifth of the nation s expenditure for vocational education the great impact of the matching-fund principle have be in initially encourage the poor state and school district to spend enough to obtain they full allocation of outside fund national defense consideration have be the major reason behind most federal train expenditure in recent decade during world war 2 about 75 million person be enrol in course organize under two special program administer by state and local school authority 1 vocational education for national defense and 2 war production train the total cost of the five-year program be $ 297 million for the smith-hughes george-barden and national defense act of 1958 the cumulative total of federal expenditure in 42 year be only about $ 740 million no comparable measure be available of enrollments and expenditure for private vocational education train there be a great number and variety of private commercial school trade school and technical school in addition many large corporation operate they own formal train program a recent study indicate that 85 per cent of the nation s large corporation conduct educational program involve some class meeting and examination most skilled industrial worker nevertheless still acquire they skill outside of formal train institution the national manpower council of columbia university have estimate that three out of five skilled worker and one out of five technician have not be formally train there be little doubt that the student benefit from vocational education employer prefer to hire youth with such train rather than those without and most graduate of vocational train go to work in job relate to they train vocational educator do not claim that school train alone make skilled worker but it provide the essential groundwork for develop skill in most state trade and industrial train be provide in a minority of the high school usually locate in the large city in arkansas fewer than 6 per cent of the high school offer trade and industrial course in illinois about 13 per cent of the school have program and in pennsylvania 11 per cent an important recent trend be the development of area vocational school for a number of year kentucky louisiana and several other state have be build state-sponsored vocational education school that serve nearby school district in several county these school be intend to provide the facility and specialize curriculum that would not be possible for very small school district transportation may be provide from nearby school district course be provide mainly for post high school day program but sometimes arrangement also be make for high school student to attend and even extension course also may be conduct the title 8 program of the national defense education act of 1958 be a great spur to this trend toward area school by 1960 there be such school in all but 4 state they be operate in 10 of the 17 major area of chronic labor surplus and in 10 of the minor area an extension of this program into the other distress area should be undertake relation to new industry some of this trend toward area vocational school have be relate to the problem of persistent labor surplus area and they desire to attract new industry the major train need of a new industrial plant be a short period of pre-employment train for a large number of semi-skilled machine operator a few key skilled worker experience in the company s type of work usually must be bring in with the plant manager or hire away from a similar plant elsewhere a prospective industry also may be interest in the long-run advantage of train program in the area to supply future skilled worker and provide supplementary extension course for it employee the existence of a public school vocational train program in trade and industry provide a base from which such need can be fill additional course can readily be add and special cooperative program work out with any new industry if the basic facility staff and program be in be thus besides the train provide to youth in school the existence of the school program can have supplementary benefit to industry which make it an asset to industrial development effort few state make effective use of they exist vocational education program or fund for the purpose of attract new industry the opportunity exist for state to reserve some of they vocational education fund to apply on an ad hoc flexible basis to subsidize any local preemployment train program that may be quickly set up in a community to aid a new industrial plant local focus of program the major weakness of vocational train program in labor surplus area be they focus on serve solely local job demand this weakness be not unique to labor surplus area for it be inherent in the system of local school district in this country plan of vocational education program and course be orient to local employer need for train worker all the manual for set up vocational course stress the importance of first make a local survey of skill need of estimate the growth of local job and of consult with local employer on the type of course and they content furthermore there be a cautious conservatism on the part of those make local skill survey local job can be see and count while opportunity elsewhere be regard a more hypothetical while the we department of labor have a program of project industry and occupational employment trend and publish current outlook statement there be little tangible evidence that these projection have be use extensively in local curriculum plan the we office of education continue to stress local survey rather than national survey this procedure be extremely shortsighted in chronic labor surplus area with a long history of decline employment elaborate study have be make in labor surplus area in order to identify sufficient number of local job vacancy and future replacement need for certain skill to justify train program for those skill no effort be make in the same study to present information on regional or national demand trend in these skill or to consider whether regional or national demand for other skill might provide much good opportunity for the youth to be train moreover the current information on what type of train be need and possible be too limit and fragmentary there simply be not enough material available on the type of job skill that be in demand and the type of train program that be require or most suitable much of the available information come not from the federal government but from an exchange of experience among state proposal state and local agency in the vocational education field must be encourage to adopt a wide outlook on future job opportunity there be a need for an expand federal effort to provide research and information to help guide state education department and local school board in exist program a relate question be whether unemployed worker can be motivate to take the train provide there be little evidence that exist public or private train program have any great difficulty get student to enroll in they program even though they must pay tuition receive no subsistence payment and be not guarantee a job however there always be some limit to the number who will spend the time and effort to acquire train again one major difficulty be the local focus a train program in a depress area may have few enrollees unless there be some apparent prospect for good employment opportunity afterwards and the prospect may be poor if the train be aim solely at job in the local community if there be adequate information on job opportunity for skilled job elsewhere many more worker can be expect to respond another problem be who will pay for the train local school district be hard press financially and unenthusiastic about vocational train program usually be expand only when outside fund be available or local business leader demand it even industrial development leader find it hard to win local support for train unless a new industry be in sight and request it state government have be take the lead in establish area vocational school but they focus be still on area job opportunity only the federal government be likely to be able to take a long-run and nation-wide view and to pay for train to meet national skilled manpower need if only state fund be use to pay for the vocational education it could be argue that the state should not have to bear the cost of vocational train which would benefit employer in other state however if federal fund be use it would be entirely appropriate to train worker for job which could be obtain elsewhere a well a for job in the area of chronic unemployment such train would increase the tendency of worker to leave the area and find job in other locality a far possibility be suggest by the example of the g bill and also by some recent trend in attitude toward improve college education that be to provide financial assistance to individual for vocational train when local facility be inadequate this probably would require some support for subsistence a well a for tuition but the total would be no great than for the proposal of unemployment compensation or a youth conservation corps a maximum of $ 600 per year per student would enable many to take train away from home a program of financial assistance would permit place emphasis on the national interest in train highly skilled labor instead of be limit to the poor train facility in remote area the student would be able to move to large institution of concentrate specialize train such specialize train institution could be locate near the most rapidly grow industry where the equipment and job experience exist and where the future employment opportunity be locate this would heighten possibility for part-time cooperative on-the-job and extension train personal financial assistance would enable more emphasis to be place on the interest of the individual he aptitude and preference could be give more weight in select the proper train
