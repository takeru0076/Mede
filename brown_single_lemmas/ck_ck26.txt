but they all say no you time will come enjoy be a bride while you can there be no room for company in the tiny wean house where the albright boy always take they bride till they could get a house and a farm of they own so when the big house fill up and run over the sisters-in-law find bed for everyone in they own home and there be still not anything that linda kay could do so linda kay give up ask and accept she reprieve without say so she be really grateful for to attend the die be something she have never experience and certainly have not imagine when she think of the duty she would have a bobby joe s wife she have make curtain for all the window of she little house and she have keep it spotless and neat shabby a it be and cook good meal for bobby joe she have do all the thing she have promise herself she would do but she have not think of this people die she would have say in hospital or in car on the highway at night bobby joe be go all day now not come in for dinner and sometimes not for supper when they first marry he have be work in the field all day and she would get in the car and drive to wherever he be work to take he a fresh hot meal now there be no work in the field nor would there be till it rain and she do not know where he go not that she complain or have any cause to four or five of the cousin from east texas be about he age so naturally they run around together there be no reason for she to ask what they do thus a new pattern of day begin to develop for granny albright do not die she lie still on the bed she head hardly dent the pillow sometimes she open she eye and look around and sometimes she take a little milk or soup they stop expect she to die the next minute but only in the next day or two those who have drive hundreds of mile for the burial would not go home for she might die any time but they might a well unpack they suitcase for she might linger on so the pattern be establish when linda kay have put up she breakfast dish and mop she linoleum rug she would go to the big house there be not anything she could do there but that be where everyone be or would be bobby joe and the boy would come by say how s granny and sit on the porch a while the old man would be there at noon and maybe rest for a time before they take they gun off to the creek or drive down the road towards town the woman and child stay at the albrights the woman keep they voice low a they work around the house or sit in the live room sound like chicken shut up in a coop for the night the child have to play away from the house in the barn loft or the pasture behind the barn to maintain a proper quietness off and on all day someone would be wipe at the powdery gray dust that settle over everything the evaporative cool have be move to granny s room and she door be keep shut so that the rest of the house stay open though there be a question a to whether it be hot or cool that way the dust clog they throat and the heat parch they so that the woman be always make ice water they have clean up an old ice box and begin to buy fifty-pound block of ice in town a the electric refrigerator come nowhere near provide enough ice for the crowd who eat and drink there one afternoon a the woman sit cluck softly a new carload of people pull up at the gate it be a cadillac black grayed with the dust of the road it window close tight so you know that the
