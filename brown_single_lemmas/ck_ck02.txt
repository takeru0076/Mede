much time to think so many lull somehow he have forget what he must have be tell that combat be an intermittent activity now he know that the moment illuminate by the vision on the train would have to be approach it could take place tomorrow night or it might occur month from now there be just too much time time to become afraid white s suggestion flatter but he do not like the identity he do not spill over with hatred for the enemy he have nt even see he yet press he cigarette out in the earth warren walk to the slit and scan the jagged hill he see no life but still stand there for a time peer at the unlovely hill he gaze continually return to papa-san he have come here in order to test himself while most of he belief be still unsettle he know that he do not believe in kill yet he be

little one hand grenade size booby trap to fill the head with chunk of metal warren try to shake off the jumble of he fear by look at the sky it be dark prevot have say that the searchlight would be bounce off the cloud at 2230 hour which give we time to get settle in position because they be new man and to be sure that they do nt get lose prevot have place warren and white in the center of the patrol a it file out he eye now fix on white s solid figure warren could hear behind he the tread of another he could also hear the stream which he have see from he position they be go to follow it for part of they journey it s safe prevot have say and it provide cover for we noise soon they be pick they way along the edge of the stream which glow in the night on they right rise the embankment cover with brush and tree if a branch extend out too far each man hold it back for the next and if they meet a low overhang each warn the other thus stealthily they advance upstream then they turn to the right climb the embankment and walk into the valley again there be no cover here only grass sigh against pant-legs and with each sigh like a whip in the hand of an expert the grass strip something from warren the gentle whir of each footstep leave he more naked than before until he feel he unprotected flesh tremble chill by each new sound the shape of the man ahead of he lack solidity a if the whip have strip they of they very flesh the dark form move like mourner on some nocturnal pilgrimage they dirge unsung for want of vocal chord the warp break tree in the valley assume wraith-like shape clump of brush that they pass be so many enchained demon strain in anger to tear and gnaw on he bone loom over all papa-san leer down at he threaten a hundred hide malevolencies off in the distance a searchlight flash on it beam slash the sky the sharp ray be absorb by a cloud then reflect to the earth in a soft diffuse radiance somewhere over there another patrol have need of light warren think of all the man out that night who like himself have leave they protective ridge and fear work at they guts pick they way into the area beyond from the east to the west coast of the korean peninsula be a strip of land in which fear-filled man be at that same moment furtively crawl through the night sit in sweaty anticipation of any movement or sound or shout amidst confuse rifle flash and muzzle blast white s arm go up and warren raise he own the patrol be stop prevot come up take that spot over there he whisper point to a small clump of blackness give i you machine gun ammo warren hand he the metal box and prevot quietly disappear down the line lie in the grass behind the brush clump warren look about the other likewise have hide themselves in the grass and the brush over he shoulder he could see prevot with the machine gun crew even at this short distance they be only vague shape set up the machine gun on a small knoll so that it could fire above the head of the rest of the patrol warren ease he rifle s safety off and gently slowly sneak another clip of ammunition from one of the cloth bandoleer that mark the upper part of he body with an afj this he place within quick reach the walk and he fear have serve to overheat he and he sweaty armpit cool at the touch of the night air although the armored vest fit the upper part of he body snugly he feel no security figure seem to crouch in the surround dark in the distance he see a band of man who seem to advance and retreat even a he watch certain this menace be only imaginary he yet stare in fascinate horror he hand sticky against the stock of he weapon he be aware of insistent inner beating a if prisoner within seek release from he rigid body above the glow ivory baton of they searchlight point at the cloud dilute the valley s dark to a pallid light then the figure which hold he attention become a group of shatter tree stand like the grotesque of a medieval damnation scene even so he could not ease the tension of he body the rough surface of the earth itself seem to resist every attempt on he part to relax sense the unseen presence of the other man in the patrol he feel mutely unite to these nine near-stranger share this pinpoint of be with he he sense something precious in the perilous moment something akin to the knowledge gain on he bicycle trip through the french countryside a knowledge imprison in speechlessness in france he have puzzle the mean of the great stone monument man have throw up to the sky and always a he wander he feel a strange to they exultation they be poem in a strange language of which he could barely touch a mean enough to make he be ache with the desire for the fullness he sense there brittany that stone-gray mystery through which he travel for
