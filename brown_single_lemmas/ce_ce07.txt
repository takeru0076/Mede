the design of a mechanical interlocking frame be much like a mechanical puzzle but once understand the principle can be apply to any track and signal arrangement in the frame be two set of bar which interact with each other to prevent the operator from make dangerous move the main set of bar be the tappet and one tappet be connect to each lever if the lever be pull to clear a signal or move a switch the tappet move a short distance lengthwise at the same time close behind the plane of the tappet be the lock bar these can also move a short distance but at right angle to the tappet the number of lock bar require depend on how many false move must be prevent in the side of the tappet be notch with slope side and connection between the tappet and lock bar consist of cam call dog two or more dog be mount on each lock bar these slide into and out of the notch in the tappet a the tappet be move lock and unlock they here s how the scheme work suppose the operator pull the lever to clear a particular signal this also pull the tappet connect to the particular lever and force any dog seat in the notch to the side thus move one or more lock bar the dog on the other end of these lock bar be thus force into notch in other tappet by this scheme pull one signal to clear lock all the other switch and signal lever in safe position until the first signal be again restore to normal interlocking signal be normally at stop or red position and a lever must be pull to clear the signal this be not necessarily to green however for in some situation only a yellow indication be give to a train to let it into the plant there be other basic rule a turnout may have two lever one to actually move the switch point the other to lock the point a signal can not be clear until all the relate turnout be properly throw and lock such lock be nearly always use where the switch point face oncoming traffic the lock insure that the point be throw all the way with no chance that a wheel flange will snag on a partly throw point if the point be nt throw all the way the turnout can not be lock and in turn the signal can not be clear generally these lock on turnout be call face point lock fig 1-6 show typical arrangement of track and signal each diagram be accompany by a dog chart a list of the lever that show which other lever any particular lever will lock if pull the line connect the wedge-shaped dog represent the lock bar at right angle to the tappet bar by study the track-signal diagram you ll note several other detail derail mechanical track device that actually guide the wheel off the rail if a train pass a stop signal be use in many instance home signal have two blade the blacked-in blade indicate a fix aspect the blade do not move a an engineer approach the plant the position of the home signal be see in advance when he pass the distant signal locate beyond the limit of the interlocking plant in some low-speed situation the distant signal be fix at caution in other instance where there be no automatic block signale the distant have only green and yellow aspect so much for the prototype the interlocking frame we build at the model railroader workshop and then install on paul larson s railroad follow the fig 1 scheme and be show begin in fig 7 page 65 and in the photo here s how it can be build frame the size of piece need for the interlocking frame be show in the note within fig 7 most of the bar be 18 brass in 14 and 12 width you may change the dimension to suit a frame for more or fewer lever and lock a you wish we instruction assume you be build this particular frame which be for a junction when cut the piece dress the end smooth and square with a smooth file or sand disk start with the right-hand piece b afj solder it to the low piece a of the same material but 12 long let exactly 1 of a extend beyond b and use a square to check you angle to exactly 90 degree now lie 12 piece of afj cut 5-34 long side by side but separate by 12 piece of the same material 12 sq this give you the space for locate the left-hand piece b compress the assembly when you make the mark to show the location for b solder this second b to a at right angle there should be 10 between the two parallel member and each should be 1 from an end of the long piece cap this assembly with space bar in place with a afj bar tack-solder all the 12 sq piece to the 10 and 12 member these will be drill and tap late on now cut five afj lock bar spacer which run horizontally position these use six intermediate temporary afj spacer and locate the upper 12 bar a solder it and the five lock bar spacer to the frame now place 12 piece 12 sq on this edge a we do before and space they with the 5-34 long tappet a they be call cap with a afj bar and tack-solder in place cap the lock bar spacer with two afj directly under the first two b piece remove all the loose space bar mark and center-punch all the hole require for screw to hold this assembly together see fig 7 placement of these hole be not critical but they should be locate so that the center be about 18 from any edge drill all no 50 and counter-drill all except the a piece size 43 tap the a piece 2-56 now unsold and disassemble the frame except for the two 12 and the first two 3-34 bar a and b piece which be solder together either lie the component aside in proper order or code they with number and letter so they may be replace in they proper position dress all surface with a file clean off all solder and drill burr drill 20 no 47 hole in the upper piece a a show in fig 7 tap these 3-48 for mount the electrical contact late on note 6 and 8 lock lever do nt require hole for contact now reassemble the frame use afj roundhead steel screw and nut put the 12 tappet and some afj lock bar spacer in the frame to help align all the component before you tighten the screw be sure the tappet be not pinch by a twist 12 sq spacer a an anchor for the spring lock insert a afj bar in the low leave corner of the frame a show in fig 7 drill a no 43 hole through the piece and secure with a 2-56 nut and screw drill two no 50 hole one in the insert and one in the lock bar spacer directly above it and tap 2-56 number all the tappet bar before remove they so they can be replace in the same slot remove all other loose piece and file the edge of the basic frame smooth cut five piece of afj brass bar stock 3-34 long these be support member for the short lock bar locate they position in fig 7 and drill no 43 to match the correspond hole in the frame cut off excess screw length and file flush with either frame or nut drill four no 19 and four no 28 hole in the 12 long a piece locate the position from fig 7 tappet and lock bar draw-file no 1 tappet to a smooth fit in it respective slot and square the end break the end corner with a slight 45 degree chamfer drill a no 50 hole 1-14 from one end and tap 2-56 see fig 7 put a 2-56 roundhead screw into the hole cut off the excess thread and file flush with the underside of the bar to find the other stop screw position insert the tappet into the frame and hold the screw head tight against the frame edge scribe a line across the bar on the other end of the tappet 14 plus half the diameter of the 2-56 screw head about 564 away from the frame edge total distance be about 2164 tend to make this dimension slightly undersize so you can file the screw head to get exactly 14 tappet movement drill a no 50 hole tap 2-56 and insert a roundhead 2-56 screw a you do on the first end drill a no 47 hole crosswise through the tappet at the position show in fig 7 and 8 repeat these drill and tap operation for each of the tappet bar to each tappet except 6 and 8 solder a afj piece of brass and file to the taper shape show in fig 6 and 8 these will serve a lift pad for the electrical contact fit the lock bar and make the lock piece be a rather tedious job since stop screw tappet and lock bar must be remove and replace many time a the work progress the frame and move part become a sort of chinese puzzle where several piece must be remove before the part you be work on be accessible a little extra work here will pay off with a smooth snug-fitting machine when you be finish each complete lock bar should remain in place a the work progress to insure snug fit the order of fit be not too important however we start with the first row of bar and work we way back since the same method of shape and fit the dog and notch be use throughout we will only describe the construction of one lock bar fig 7 and 8 give all pertinent dimension all the bar be cut from afj brass the length of each piece be list at the bottom of fig 7 bar c be 2-34 long draw-file the edge square up the end and put a slight chamfer on the edge so they will not snag in the frame fig 8 give the dimension for locate the dog-pin hole center-punch and drill the no 31 hole 716 from one end of the bar chuck a length of 18 dia drill rod into a drill press or some similar turn device and while it be rotate file the end square and then file a slight taper 18 long cut the piece about 932 or 516 long and drive it into the no 31 hole drill in the lock bar file the bottom edge flush with the bar and the top 18 above the bar this dog will engage a notch to be cut in tappet 3 place the lock bar in proper position and insert tappet 3 scribe a line through the center of the pin and across the face of tappet 3 parallel to piece a see the drawing for the shape of the notch scribe v-shaped line on the bar and rough out with either a hack see or a cut disk in a hand power tool we use the latter equip with a carborundum disk about thick and 1 dia fit on a 18 dia mandrel such disk be very handy for cut and shape small part file to a smooth finish a barrette swiss pattern file be handy since it triangular shape with only one cut face will allow you to work a surface without mar an adjoin one endeavor to get the notch a much alike a possible the notch should have a smooth finish so that the steel dog will slide easily over it assemble the part in the frame and test the slide action of the mate piece all match surface should be check frequently and mate on a cut and fit basis chuck a 2 or 3 piece of 18 dia drill rod in a drill press or electric hand tool fashion a sharp scribe point about 364 long on one end use swiss pattern file this tool can also be make with a lathe
