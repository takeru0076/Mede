public s response at the next concert be a stand ovation now that bruno walter be virtually in retirement and i dear friend dimitri mitropoulos be no long with we i be probably the only one with the possible exception of leonard bernstein who have this special affinity for and champion the work of bruckner and mahler since he introduce so much modern music i could not resist ask how he feel about it there be always and at all time a contemporary music and it express the era in which it be create but i usually stick to the old phrase ich habe ein amt aber keine meinung i hold an office but i do not feel entitle to have an opinion i consider it to be i job to expose the public to what be be write today with all he musical activity do he have the time and inclination to do anything else he have just pay a brief visit to the frick collection to admire he favorite painting by rembrandt and franz hal he be not enthusiastic over the newly acquire claude lorrain but reminisce with pleasure

comment a i wife put it he say again with a twinkle in he eye all you know be you music but after all you never learn anything else what do he do for relaxation like he late colleague mitropoulos he read mystery story in particular sir arthur conan doyle he cite heine and stendhal a favorite in literature but he prime interest apart from music he insist seriously be he family he wife daughter and son at the moment he be excite about he son s have receive the prix de rome in archaeology and be look forward to be present this summer at the excavation of an etruscan tomb both child be musical and i wife be a music lover of unfailing instinct and judgement be the attitude of german youth comparable to that of the angry young man of england be the topic for a round-table discussion at the bayerische rundfunk in munich i be chairman the only not youthful participant since attack serve to stimulate interest in broadcast i add to i open statement a sentence in which i claim that german youth seem to lack the enthusiasm which be a necessary ingredient of anger and might be classify a uninterested and bore rather than angry i be far from convince of the truth of i statement but could not think of anything that might evoke response more quickly it be easy for you to talk counter a twenty year old law student you travel around the world we would like to do that too but you want a job guarantee when you return i continue i attack you must have some security say a young clerk when i mention that for i first long voyage i do not even have the money for the return fare but have trust to luck that i would earn a sufficient amount the young people look at i doubtingly one girl express what be obviously in they mind would you advise we to act the same way you might have fail i think it be rather foolhardy to trust to luck other mention that i might have have to ask friend or even stranger for help and that to be strand in a foreign country without sufficient fund do not contribute to international understand the debate need no additional controversy and soon i could ask each individually what he expect from life what he hope be and what he fear though the four boy and two girl the young nineteen year of age the old twenty-four come from vary background and have different professional and personal interest there be surprise agreement among they what they wish for most be security what they fear most be war or political instability in they own country the ideal home they agree would be a small private house or a city apartment of four to five room just enough for a family consist of husband wife and two child no one want a large family or no child and none hope for a castle or say that live in less settle circumstance would be satisfactory all express interest in world affair but no one offer to make any sacrifice to satisfy this interest
