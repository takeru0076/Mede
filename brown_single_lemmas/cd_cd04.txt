the death of a man be unique and yet it be universal the straight line would symbolize it uniqueness the circle it universality but how can one figure symbolize both christianity declare that in the life and death of jesus christ the unique and the universal concur perhaps no church father see this concurrence of the unique and the universal a clearly or formulate it a precisely a irenaeus to be the savior and the lord jesus christ have to be a historical individual with a biography all he own he dare not be a cosmic aeon that swoop to earth for a while but never identify itself with man s history yet this utterly individual historical person must also contain within himself the common history of mankind he history be he alone yet each man must recognize he own history in it he death be he alone yet each man can see he own death in the crucifixion of jesus each man can identify himself with the history and the death of jesus christ because jesus christ have identify himself with human history and human death come a the head of a new humanity not a circle then nor a straight line but a spiral represent the shape of death a irenaeus see it for a spiral have motion a well a recurrence a represent by a spiral history may in some sense be say to repeat itself yet each historical event remain unique christ be both unique and universal the first turn of the spiral be the primeval history of humanity in adam a origen interpret the end of history on the basis of it begin so irenaeus portray the story of adam on the basis of the story of christ whence then come the substance of the first man from god s will and wisdom and from virgin earth for god have not rain say the scripture before man be make and there be no man to till the earth from this earth then while it be still virgin god take dust and fashion the man the begin of humanity irenaeus do not regard adam and eve merely a private individual but a universal human being who be and be all of humanity adam and eve be perfect not in the sense that they possess perfection but in the sense that they be capable of development toward perfection they be in fact child irenaeus do not claim pre-existence for the human soul therefore there be no need for he a there be for origen to identify existence itself with the fall existence be create and will by god and be not the consequence of a pre-existent rebellion or of a cosmic descent from eternity into history historical existence be a create good the biblical symbol for this affirmation be express in the word so god create man in he own image in the similitude of god he create he there be some passage in the writing of irenaeus where the image of god and the similitude be sharply distinguish so most notably in the statement if the holy spirit be absent from the soul such a man be indeed of an animal nature and be leave carnal he will be an imperfect be possess the image of god in he formation but not receive the similitude of god through the spirit thus the image of god be that which make a man a man and not an oyster the similitude of god by contrast be that which make a man a child of god and not merely a rational creature recent research on irenaeus however make it evident that he do not consistently maintain this distinction he do not mean to say that adam lose the similitude of god and he immortality through the fall for he be create not exactly immortal nor yet exactly mortal but capable of immortality a well a of mortality therefore irenaeus describe man s creation a follow so that the man should not have thought of grandeur and become lift up a if he have no lord because of the dominion that have be give to he and the freedom fall into sin against god he creator overstep he bound and take up an attitude of self-conceited arrogance towards god a law be give he by god that he might know that he have for lord the lord of all and he lay down for he certain condition so that if he keep the command of god then he would always remain a he be that be immortal but if he do not he would become mortal melt into earth whence he frame have be take these condition man do not keep and thus he become mortal yet he do not stop be human a a result there be no justification for systematize the random statement of irenaeus about the image of god beyond this nor for read into he imprecise usage the late theological distinction between the image of god humanity and the similitude of god immortality man be create with the capacity for immortality but the devil s promise of immortality in exchange for disobedience cost adam he immortality he be in the word of irenaeus beguile by another under the pretext of immortality the true way to immortality lie through obedience but man do not believe this eve be disobedient for she do not obey when a yet she be a virgin and even a she have indeed a husband adam but be nevertheless a yet a virgin have become disobedient be make the cause of death both to herself and to the entire human race so also do mary have a man betroth to she and be nevertheless a virgin by yield obedience become the cause of salvation both to herself and the whole human race because he interpret the primitive state of man a one of mere potentiality or capacity and believe that adam and eve be create a child irenaeus often seem incline to extenuate they disobedience a be due no doubt to carelessness but still wicked he interpretation of the begin on the basis of the end prompt he to draw these parallel between the virgin eve and the virgin mary that parallelism affect he picture of man s disobedience too for a it be christ the word of god who come to rescue man so it be disobedience to the word of god in the begin that bring death into the world and all we woe with this act of disobedience and not with the inception of he individual existence man begin the downward circuit on the spiral of history descend from the create capacity for immortality to an inescapable mortality at the nadir of that circuit be death along with the fruit they do also fall under the power of death because they do eat in disobedience and disobedience to god entail death wherefore a they become forfeit to death from that moment they be hand over to it this lead irenaeus to the somewhat startle notion that adam and eve die on the same day that they disobey namely on a friday a a parallel to the death of christ on good friday he see a parallel also to the jewish day of preparation for the sabbath in any case though they have be promise immortality if they eat of the tree they obtain mortality instead the wage of sin be death man s life originally shape for immortality and for communion with god must now be conform to the shape of death nevertheless even at the nadir of the circuit the spiral of history belong to god and he still rule even death therefore have a providential a well a a punitive function wherefore also he god drive he man out of paradise and remove he far from the tree of life not because he envy he the tree of life a some venture to assert but because he pity he and do not desire that he should continue a sinner for ever nor that the sin which surround he should be immortal and evil interminable and irremediable but he set a bind to he state of sin by interpose death and thus cause sin to cease put an end to it by the dissolution of the flesh which should take place in the earth so that man cease at length to live in sin and die to it might live to god this idea which occur in both tatian and cyprian fit especially well into the scheme of irenaeus theology for it prepare the way for the passage from life through death to life that be achieve in christ a man can live only by die so it be only by he die that christ could bring many to life it be probably fair to say that the idea of death be more profound in irenaeus than the idea of sin be this apply to he picture of adam it be bear out also by the absence of any develop theory about how sin pass from one generation to the next it become most evident in he description of christ a the second adam who do indeed come to destroy sin but whose work culminate in the achievement of immortality this emphasis upon death rather than sin a man s fundamental problem irenaeus share with many early theologian especially the greek-speaking one they speak of the work of christ a the bestowal of incorruptibility which can mean though it do not have to mean deliverance from time and history death remind man of he sin but it remind he also of he transience it represent a punishment that he know he deserve but it also symbolize most dramatically that he life he life within the process of time these two aspect of death can not be successfully separate but they dare not be confuse or identify the repeat effort in christian history to describe death a altogether the consequence of human sin show that these two aspect of death can not be separate such effort almost always find themselves compel to ask whether adam be create capable of grow old and then old and then still old in short whether adam s life be intend to be part of the process of time if it be then it must have be god s intention to translate he at a certain point from time to eternity one night so some of these theory run adam would have fall asleep much a he fall asleep for the creation of eve and thus he would have be carry over into the life eternal the embarrassment of these theory over the naturalness of death be an illustration of the thesis that death can not be only a punishment for some termination seem necessary in a life that be live within the natural order of time and change on the other hand christian faith know that death be more than the natural termination of temporal existence it be the wage of sin and it sting be the law if this aspect of death a punishment be not distinguish from the idea of death a natural termination the conclusion seem inevitable that temporal existence itself be a form of punishment rather than the state into which man be put by the will of the creator this seem to have be the conclusion to which origen be force if death receive more than it share of attention from the theologian and if sin receive less than it share the gift of the life eternal through christ begin to look like the divinely appoint mean of rescue from temporal ie create existence such an interpretation of death radically alter the christian view of creation for it teach salvation from not salvation in time and history because christianity teach not only salvation in history but salvation by the history of christ such an interpretation of death would require a drastic revision of the christian understand of the work of christ
