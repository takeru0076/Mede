color be delay until 1935 the wide screen until the early fifties movement itself be the chief and often the only attraction of the primitive movie of the nineties each film consist of fifty foot which give a run time of about one minute on the screen a long a audience come to see the movement there seem little reason to adventure far motion-picture exhibition take place in store in a general atmosphere like that of the penny arcade which can still be find in such urban area a time square brief snip of actual event be show parade dance street scene the sensational and frighten enjoy popularity a train rush straight at the audience or a great wave threaten to break over the seat an early edison production be the execution of mary queen of scot the unfortunate queen mount the scaffold the headsman swing he axe the head drop off end of film an early film by a competitor of the wizard of menlo park simply show a long kiss perform by two actor of the contemporary stage in the field of entertainment there be no spur to financial dare so effective a audience boredom and the first decade of the new device be not over before audience begin stay away in large number from the simple-minded one-minute show in response the industry allow the discovery of the motion picture a a form of fiction and thus give the movie the essential form they have have to this day despite the sheer beauty and spectacle of numerous documentary art film and travelogue despite the impressive financial success of such a recent development a cinerama the movie be at heart a form of fiction like the play the novel or the short story moreover the most artistically successful of the nonfiction film have invariably borrow the narrative form from the fiction feature thus such great american documentary a the river and the plow that break the plain be compose a visual story rather than a illustrate lecture the discovery that movie be a form of fiction be make in the early year of this century and it be make chiefly by two man a french magician georges melies and an american employee of edison edwin s porter of the two porter be justly the good know for he go far beyond the vital find of fiction for film to take the first step toward fashion a language of film toward make the motion picture the intricate efficient time machine that it have remain since even in the most inept hand narrative time and film time melies however out of he professional instinct a a magician discover and make use of a number of illusionary technique that remain part of the vocabulary of film one of these be the dissolve which make possible a visually smooth transition from scene to scene a the first scene begin to fade the succeed scene begin to appear for a moment or two both scene be present simultaneously one grow weak one grow strong in a series of fairy tale and fantasy melies demonstrate that the film be superbly equip to tell a straightforward story with begin middle and end complication resolution climax and conclusion immediately the film improve and it improve because in narrative it find a content base on time to complement it own unbreakable connection with time physically a movie be possible because a series of image be project one at a time at such a speed that the eye remember the one that have go before even a it register the one now appear link the smoothly change image together the eye itself endow they with the illusion of movement the projection time of painting and sculpture be highly subjective vary from person to person and even vary for a give person on different occasion so be the time of the novel the drama in the theater and the concert in the hall both have a fix time but the time be fix by the director and the player the conductor and the instrumentalist subject therefore to much variation a record collector well know the time of the motion picture be fix absolutely the film consist of a series of still transparent photograph or frame 35-mm-wide each frame come between the light and the lens and be individually project on the screen at the rate for silent movie of 16 frame per second and for sound film 24 frame per second this be the rate of projection it be also the rate of photograph time be build into the motion picture which can not exist without time now time be also the concern of the fictional narrative which be at it simple the story of an action with usually a begin a middle and an end element which demand time a the first condition for they existence the move picture of the train or the wave come at the audience be to be sure more intense than a still picture of the same subject but the difference be really one of degree the cinematic element of time be merely use to increase the realism of an object which would still be reasonably realistic in a still photo in narrative time be essential a it be in film almost everything about the movie that be peculiarly of the movie derive from a tension create and maintain between narrative time and film time this discovery of melies be vastly more important than he sometimes dazzle magician s trick produce on film it be porter however who produce the very first movie whose name have live on through the half century of film history that have since ensue the movie be the great train robbery and it effect on the young industry and art be all but incalculable overnight for one thing porter s film multiply the standard run time of movie by ten the great train robbery be a one-reel film one reel from eight to twelve minute become the standard length from the year of robbery 1903 until griffith shatter that limit forever with birth of a nation in 1915 the reel itself become and still be the standard of measure for the movie the material of the porter film be simplicity itself much of it have continue to be use over the year and the heart of it good guy and bad guy in the old west pretty well dominate television toward the end of the 1950 s a band of robber enter a railroad station overpower and tie up the telegraph operator hold up the train and escape a posse be form and pursue the robber who have make they escape be whoop it up with some wild wild woman in a honky-tonk hide-out the robber run from the hide-out take cover in a wooded declivity and be shoot dead by the posse a a finale be append a close-up of one of the band take aim and fire he revolver straight at the audience all this be simple enough but in tell the story porter do two important thing that have not be do before each scene be shoot straight through a have be the universal custom from a camera fix in a single position but in the outdoor scene especially in the capture and destruction of the outlaw porter s camera position break necessarily with the camera position standard until then which have be roughly that of a spectator in a center orchestra seat at a play the plane of the action in the scene be not parallel with the plane of the film in the camera or on the screen if the change at first sight seem minor we may recall that it take the italian painter about two hundred year to make an analogous change and the italian painter by universal consent be the most brilliant group of genius any art have see in that apparently simple shift porter open the way to the sensitive use of the camera a an instrument of art a well a a mechanical record device he do more than that he reveal the potential value of the cut a the basic technique in the art of the film cut of course take place automatically in the creation of a film the mean of the word be quite physical to begin with the physical film be cut with a knife at the end of one complete sequence and the cut edge be join physically by cement to the cut edge of the begin of the next sequence if a a home movie maker you shoot the inevitable footage of you child take it first step you have merely record an historical event if in prepare that shoot for the inevitable show to you friend you interrupt the sequence to paste in a few frame of the child s grandmother watch this event you have begin to be an artist in film you be employ the basic technique of film you be cut this be what porter do a the robber leave the loot train the film suddenly cut back to the station where the telegrapher s little daughter arrive with she father s dinner pail only to find he bind on the floor she dash around in alarm the two event be take place at the same time time and space have both become cinematic we leap from event to event include the formation of the posse even though the event in reality be take place not in sequence but simultaneously and not near each other but at a considerable distance the chase a a standard film device probably date from the great train robbery and there be a reason for the continue popularity of the device the chase in itself be a narrative it presume both speed and urgency and it demand cut both from pursue to pursuer and from stage to stage of the journey of both the simple naked idea of one man chase another be of it nature good fit for the film than it be for any other form of fiction the cowboy film the cop and robber film and the slapstick comedy film culminate in an insane chase be not only cater to what critic may assume to be a vulgar taste for violence these film and these sequence be also seek out instinctively or by design the peculiarly cinematic element of narrative the creator of the art of the film dw griffith there still remain the need for one great film artist to explore the full potential of the new form and to make it an art the man be dw griffith when he come to the movie more or less by accident they be still cheap entertainment capable of enthral the unthinking for an idle few minute in about seven year griffith either invent or first realize the possibility of virtually every resource at the disposal of the film maker before he be forty griffith have create the art of the film not that there have not be attempt mostly european to do exactly that but in general the european effort to make an art of the entertainment have ignore the slowly emerge language of the film itself staggeringly condense version of famous novel and famous play be present great actor and actress the most notable be sarah bernhardt be hire to repeat they stage performance before the camera in all of this extensive and expensive effort the camera be downgrade to the status of record instrument for art work produce elsewhere by the actor or by the author the phonograph today for all it high fidelity and stereophonic sound be precisely what the early art purveyor in the movie wish to make of the camera not surprisingly this approach do not work the effort produce a valuable record of stage technique in the early year of the century and some interest record of great theater figure who would otherwise be only name but no art at all be bear of the art effort in the early movie
