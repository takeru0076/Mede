five four three two one fire the tremendous energy release by giant rocket engine perhaps can be feel much good than it can be hear the pulsate vibration of energy clutch at the pit of you stomach never before have the introduction of a weapon cause so much apprehension and fear nuclear weapon be fearsome but the long-range ballistic missile give they a stealth and merciless swiftness which be much more terrify a great many writer be bewitch by the apparently overwhelming advantage an attacker would have if he be to strike with complete surprise use nuclear rocket it be relatively easy to go a step far and reason that an attacker in possession of such absolute power would simultaneously destroy he opponent s city and people with a nation defenseless before it why would the attacker spare the victim s people would nt the wanton destruction of city and people be the logical act of complete subjugation the nation would be utterly devastate the will of it people so crucial in time of peril would be break nuclear weapon have give the world the mean for self-destruction in hour or day and now rocket have give it the mean to destroy itself in minute at this point it should be painfully obvious that city be soft and the people within they be ideally suit to destruction by nuclear weapon however because this vulnerability be mutual it be to the advantage of neither side to destroy the opponent s city at least so long a the opponent have nuclear weapon with which to effect reprisal it should be appallingly apparent that city-trading be not a profitable military tactic icbm have give we a capability which could be use in two different way they could be use to attack a nation s people which would inevitably mean the loss of the attacker s own people or they could be use with discrimination to destroy the enemy s military force if we national interest lie in be able to fight and win a war rather than commit national suicide then we must take a much more penetrate look at ballistic missile we must determine whether missile can win a war all by themselves we must make certain that the aircraft be finish before we give the entire job to the missile missile be very valuable weapon but they also have they too little know limitation because of a missile s ballistic trajectory the location of a fix target must be know quite accurately place missile in submarine on barge railroad highway surface vessel and in the air provide they with passive protection by take advantage of the grave weakness of long-range ballistic missile today the extreme difficulty of destroy a mobile or move target with such weapon one must first detect a fleet mobile or move target decide that it be worthy of destruction select the missile to be fire against the target compute ballistic for the flight and prepare the missile for fire even if all these operation could be perform instantaneously the icbm still have a time of flight to the target of about 30 minute therefore if the target can significantly change it location in something less than 30 minute the probability of have destroy it be drastically lower because of this it would appear inevitable that an increase percentage of strategic missile will seek self-protection in mobility at least until missile defense be perfect which have an exceedingly high kill probability in order to destroy the enemy s mobile move or imprecisely locate strategic force we must have a hunter-killer capability in addition to we missile until this hunter-killer operation can be perform by spacecraft man aircraft appear to be the only mean available to we it seem reasonable that if general nuclear war be not to be one cataclysmic act of burn each other s citizen to cinder we must have a man strategic force of long-endurance aircraft capable of go into china or russia to find and destroy they strategic force which continue to threaten we let we suppose the russian decide to build a rail-mobile icbm force it be entirely feasible to employ aircraft such a the b-52 or b-70 in hunter-killer operation against soviet railway-based missile if we stop think in term of tremendous multimegaton nuclear weapon and consider employ much small nuclear weapon which may be more appropriate for most important military target it would seem that the b-52 or b-70 could carry a great many small nuclear weapon an aircraft with a load of small nuclear weapon could very conceivably be give a mission to suppress all train operate within a specify geographic area of russia provide that we have use some of we icbm to degrade russia s air defense before we bomber get there the aircraft could be use to destroy other mobile fleet and imprecisely locate target a well a the know fix and harden target which can also be destroy by missile why then be nt we plan a large more important role for man military aircraft be there any other way to do the job survivability of we strategic force polaris mobile and harden minuteman harden atlas and titan and airborne skybolt mean that it will take some time perhaps week to destroy a strategic force war under these circumstance can not be one massive exchange of nuclear devastation force will survive a surprise attack and these force will give depth or considerable duration to the conflict the force which survive the initial attack must be find and destroy even mobile force must be find and destroy but how do one go about the job of find and destroy mobile force they be not susceptible to wholesale destruction by ballistic missile some day many year in the future true spacecraft will be able to find and destroy mobile target but until we have an effective spacecraft the answer to the hunter-killer problem be man aircraft however the aircraft which we have today be tie to large soft airfield nuclear rocket can destroy airfield with ease here then be we problem aircraft be vital to win a war today because they can perform those mission which a missile be totally incapable of perform but the airfield on which the aircraft be completely dependent be doom by the missile this make today s aircraft a one-shot or one mission weapon aircraft be mighty expensive if you can use they only once this be the point on which so many people have write off the aircraft in favor of the missile but remember this it be nt the aircraft which be vulnerable to nuclear rocket it be the airfield eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground and you have essentially eliminate it vulnerability to long-range ballistic missile there be four rather obvious way to reduce or eliminate the vulnerability of aircraft on the ground put aircraft in bomb-proof hangar when they be on the ground build long-range aircraft which can take off from small 3000-foot airfield with runway if we could use all the small airfield we have in this country we could disperse we strategic aircraft by a factor of 10 or more use nuclear propulsions to keep we long-range military aircraft in the air for the majority of they useful life use very high thrust-to-weight ratio engine develop a vertical-takeoff-and-landing vtol long-range military aircraft we have the technology today with which to build aircraft shelter which could withstand at least 200 afj we could put a portion of we strategic bomber in such shelter large long-range bomber can be develop which would have the capability to take off from 3000-foot runway but they would require more powerful engine than we have today there be little enthusiasm for spend money to develop more powerful engine because of the erroneous belief that the aircraft have be make obsolete by the missile this same preoccupation with missile at the expense of aircraft have result in we half-hearted effort to develop nuclear propulsion for aircraft one seldom hear the analogy nuclear propulsion will do for the aircraft what it have already do for the submarine if for some reason such a economy we be not go to develop aircraft nuclear propulsion with a sense of national urgency then we should turn we effort to develop jet engine with a thrust-to-weight ratio of 12 or 15 to one with powerplant such a these vertical takeoff and land combat aircraft could be build for example a 12-to-one engine would power a supersonic vtol fighter with a 15-to-one engine a supersonic aircraft weigh 300000 pound could rise vertically the reason that we be not go ahead full speed to develop high thrust-to-weight engine be that it would cost perhaps a billion dollar and you do nt spend that sort of money if aircraft be obsolete when aircraft be no long helpless on airfield they be no long vulnerable to afj if we sac bomber be today capable of survive a surprise missile attack and because of infinite dispersion or long endurance have the capability to strike at russia again and again and again those bomber would unquestionably assure we military dominance we would have the mean to seek out and destroy the enemy s force whether it be fix or mobile with such a force of man bomber we could bring enormous pressure to bear on an enemy and this pressure would be selective and extremely discriminate no need to kill an entire city and all it people because we lack the precision and reconnaissance to selectively disarm the enemy s military force we first necessity at the very outset of war be post-attack reconnaissance in a few year we will have samo semiautomatic missile observation system but in the case of move target and target which have limit mobility what will they location be when it be time to destroy they what target have we successfully knock out a ballistic missile can not today tell you if it be successful or unsuccessful what target still remain to be hit these crucial question must be answer by post-attack reconnaissance samo will be hard put to see through cloud and to see in the dark even if this be some day possible there remain the 30-minute time of flight of a missile to it overseas target if the target can change it position significantly during the 30 minute the missile be in the air on it way the probability of the missile destroy the target be drastically reduce pre-attack reconnaissance be vital but only post-attack reconnaissance will allow we to terminate the war favorably it would be priceless to have an aircraft to gather that post-attack reconnaissance it could operate under the cloud and perform infrared photography through cloud and at night it would be even more valuable because that same aircraft could immediately destroy any target it discover no need to wait for a missile to come all the way from the unite state with the chance that the target if it be mobile would be go a large aircraft such a the b-52 or b-70 could carry perhaps 50 or 100 small nuclear weapon few people realize that one kiloton of nuclear explosive power will create 1000 psi overpressure at 100 foot or put another way the hard missile site plan today could be destroy by place a one-kiloton warhead 120th the size of those use in hiroshima and nagasaki within 100 to 200 foot of the target it be we lack of extreme accuracy which force the use of very large yield nuclear weapon today we have side-looking radar which have such high resolution that the radar picture clearly show individual building runway taxi-ways separate span of bridge etc with these keen eye and small nuclear weapon deliver with accuracy military force can be directly attack with minimum damage to urban area if we fail to develop the mean to hunt down and destroy the enemy s military force with extreme care and precision and if war come in spite of we most ardent desire for peace we choice of alternative will be truly frighten
