the recent experiment in the new poetry-and-jazz movement see by some a part of the san francisco renaissance have be a popular a they be notorious it might well start a craze like swallow goldfish or pee-wee golf write kenneth rexroth in an explanatory note in the evergreen review and he may have be right under the general head poetry-and-jazz widely divergent experiment have be carry out lawrence ferlenghetti and bruce lippincott have concentrate on write a new poetry for read with jazz that be very closely relate to both the musical form of jazz and the vocabulary of the musician even musician themselves have take to write poetry judy tristano now have poem a well a ballad write for she but the good know exploiter of the new medium be kenneth rexroth and kenneth patchen rexroth and patchen be far apart musically and poetically in they experiment rexroth be a longtime jazz buff a name-dropper of jazz hero and a student of traditional a well a modern jazz in san francisco he have work with brew moore charlie mingus and other swing musician of secure reputation thus place himself within establish jazz tradition in addition to be a part of the san francisco school although patchen have give previous evidence of an interest in jazz the musical group that he work with the chamber jazz sextet be often ignore by jazz critic downbeat do not mention the los angeles appearance of patchen and the sextet although the engagement last over two month the state goal of the cjs be the synthesis of jazz and serious music patchen s musician be outsider in establish jazz circle and patchen himself have remain outside the san francisco poetry group maintain a self-imposed isolation even though he conversion to poetry-and-jazz be not a extreme or a sudden a it may first appear he have read he poetry with musician a early a 1951 and he entire career have be characterize by radical experiment with the form and presentation of he poetry however he subject matter and basic theme have remain surprisingly consistent and these together with certain key poetic image may be trace through all he work include the new jazz experiment from the begin of he career patchen have adopt an anti-intellectual approach to poetry he first book before the brave 1936 be a collection of poem that be almost all communistic but after publication of this book he reject communism and advocate a pacifistic anarchy though retain he revolutionary idiom he speak for a proletariat that include all the lose and sick and hunt of the earth patchen believe that the world be be destroy by power-hungry and money-hungry people run counter to the destroy force in the world be all the virtue that be innate in man the capacity for love and brotherhood the ability to appreciate beauty beauty a well a love be redemptive and patchen preach a kind of moral salvation this salvation do not take the form of a christian heaven in patchen s eye organize church be a odious a organize government and christian symbol have be take over by the money class be now agent of corruption patchen envision a dark kingdom which stand above the water a a sentinel warn man of danger from he own kind the dark kingdom send angel of death and other fateful messenger down to we with stern tenderness actually heaven and the dark kingdom overlap they form two aspect of heavenly life after death patchen have almost never use strict poetic form he have experiment instead with personal myth-making much of he early work be conceive in term of a pseudo-anthropological myth reference which be concern with imaginary place and being describe in grandiloquent and travelogue-like language these early experiment be evidently not altogether satisfy to patchen begin in cloth of the tempest 1943 he experiment in merge poetry and visual art use drawing to carry long narrative segment of a story a in sleeper awake and construct elaborate poems-in-drawing-and-type in which it be impossible to distinguish between the art and the poetry art making or pseudo-anthropological myth do not meet all of patchen s requirement for a poetic frame of reference many of he poem purport to be exactly contemporary and political so during the period approximately from 1941 to 1946 patchen often use private detective story a a myth reference and the private eye a a myth hero speak in term of sociological stereotype the private eye might appeal to the poet in search of a myth for many reason the private detective at least in the mind of listener and reader all over the country be an individual hero fight injustice he be usually something of an underdog he must battle the organize police force a well a recognize criminal the private detective must rely a the young son or trickster hero do in primitive myth on he wit the private detective be militant against injustice a humorous and ironic explorer of the underworld most important to patchen he be a non-literary hero and very contemporary in 1945 probably almost every american not only know who sam spade be but have some kind of emotional feel about he in the memoir of a shy pornographer 1945 patchen exploit this national sentiment by make he hero albert budd a private detective but since 1945 sam spade have undergo a metamorphosis he have become friday on dragnet a mouthpiece of arbitrary police authority he have like so many other secular and religious culture symbol go over to the side of the rule class obviously the private eye can have no more appeal for patchen to fill the job of contemporary hero in 1955 patchen need someone else it be logical that he would come up with the figure of the modern jazz musician the revolution in jazz that take place around 1949 the evolution from the bebop school of dizzy gillespie to the cool sound of mile davis and lennie tristano lee konitz and the whole legend of charlie parker have make an impression on many academic and literary man the differentiation between the east coast and west coast school of jazz the difference between the hard bop school of rollins and the cerebral experiment of tristano konitz and marsh the general difference in the more of white and negro musician all have become fairly well know to certain segment of the public the immense amount of interest that the new jazz have for the young generation must have impress he and he begin work toward the merger of jazz and poetry a he have previously attempt the union of graphic art and poetry in addition to he experiment in read poetry to jazz patchen be begin to use the figure of the modern jazz musician a a myth hero in the same way he use the figure of the private detective a decade ago in this respect he approach to poetry-and-jazz be in mark contrast to kenneth rexroth s rexroth use many of he early poem when he read to jazz include many of he chinese and japanese translation he usually draw some kind of comparison with the jazz tradition and the poem he be read for instance he draw the parallel between a poem he read about an oriental courtesan wait for the man she love and who never come and the old blue chant of ma rainy and other negro singer but usually the comparison be specious rexroth may sometimes achieve an effective juxtaposition but he rarely make any effort to capture any jazz feel in the text of he poem rely on he very competent musician to supply this feel patchen do read some of he early work to music but he have write an entire book of short poem which seem to be especially suit for read with jazz these new poem have only a few direct reference to jazz and jazz musician but they show change in patchen s approach to he poetry for he have try to enter into and understand the emotional attitude of the jazz musician it be difficult to draw the line between stereotype and the reality of the jazz musician everyone know that private detective in real life be not like sam spade and pat novak but the real and the imaginary musician be closely link see by the public the musician be the underdog par excellence he be force to play for little money and must often take another job to live he approach to music be highly individualistic the accent be on improvisation rather than arrangement while he be worldly the musician often cultivate public attitude of childlike astonishment and naivete the musician be non-intellectual and non-verbal he be far from be a literary hero yet be a creative artist many of these aspect will be see a comparable to those of the ideal detective but where the detective be active and militant the jazz musician be passive almost a victim of society in order to write with authority either about musician or a a musician patchen would have to soft pedal he characteristically outspoken anger and change at least for the purpose of this poetry from a revolutionary to a victim he must become one who know all about the injustice in the world but who decline do anything about it this involve a shift in patchen s attitude and it be a first step toward write a new jazz poetry he have show considerable ingenuity in adapt he early symbol and device to the new work and the fact that he have keep a body of constant symbol through all of he experiment give an unexpect continuity to he poetry perhaps trace some of these more important symbol through the body of he work will show that patchen s new poetry be well think out and remain within the mainstream of he work while be suit to a new form henry miller characterize patchen a a man of anger and light he revolutionary anger be apparent in most of he early poem the follow passage from the hangman s great hand illustrate the directness of this anger anger will nt help i be bear angry angry that i father be be burn alive in the mill angry that none of we know anything but filth and poverty angry because i be that very one somebody be suppose to be fight for this angry and exasperate stance which patchen have maintain in he poetry for almost fifteen year have be successfully modulate into a kind of woe that be a effective a anger and still express he disapproval of the modern world in he recent book hurray for anything 1957 one of the most important short poem and it be the title poem for one of the long jazz arrangement be write for recital with jazz although it do not follow the metrical rule for a blue to be sing the phrase themselves carry a blue feel i go to the city and there i do weep man a-crowing like ass and live like sheep oh can nt hold the han of i love can nt hold she little white han yes i go to the city and there i do bitterly cry man out of touch with the earth and with never a glance at the sky oh can nt hold the han of i love can nt hold she pure little han patchen be still the rebel but he write in a doleful mournful tone neither of these poem be an aberration each be so typical that it represent a prominent trend in the poet s development patchen be repeatedly preoccupy with death in many of he poem death come by train a strongly evocative visual image perhaps patchen be once involve in a train accident and this passage from first will and testament may have be how the accident appear to the poet when he first see it if he do lord love we look at all the disconnect limb float hereabouts like bloody feather at that and all the eye be talk and all the hair be move and all the tongue be in all the cheek
