in the past the duty of the state a sir henry maine note long ago be only two in number internal order and external security by prevail over other claimant for the loyalty of man the nation-state maintain an adequate measure of certainty and order within it territorial border outside those limit it assert a against other state a position of sovereign equality and a against the inferior people of the non-western world a position of dominance it become the sole subject of international law a term which it be pertinent to remember be coin by bentham a body of legal principle which by and large be make up of what western nation could do in the world arena that corpus of law be a reflection of the power system in existence during the eighteenth and nineteenth century speak generally it further and still tend to far the interest of the western power the enormous change in world politics have however throw it into confusion so much so that it be safe to say that all international law be now in need of reexamination and clarification in light of the social condition of the present era beyond the two basic task mention above no attention be pay by statesman or scholar to an idea of state responsibility either internally or externally this be particularly true in the world arena which be an anarchical battleground characterize by strife and avaricious competition for colonial empire that any sort of duty be owe by he nation to other nation would have astonish a nineteenth-century statesman he duty be to he sovereign and to he nation and an extension to people beyond the territorial boundary be not to be contemplate thus to cite but one example the pax britannica of the nineteenth century whether with the british navy rule the sea or with the city of london rule world finance be strictly national in motivation however much other nation eg the unite state may have incidentally benefit at the same time all suggestion that some sort of societal responsibility exist for the welfare of the people within the territorial state be strongly resist social darwinism be able to stave off the incipient socialist movement until well into the present century however in recent decade for what doubtless be multiple reason an unannounced but nonetheless readily observable shift have occur in both facet of national activity a concept of responsibility be in process of articulation and establishment already firmly implant internally it be a grow factor in external matter a little more than twenty year ago the american people turn an important corner in what have aptly be call a constitutional revolution the basic nature of government be transform from one essentially negative in nature the night-watchman state to one with affirmative duty to perform the positive state come into existence for lawyer reflect perhaps they parochial preference there have be a special fascination since then in the role play by the supreme court in that transformation the manner in which it decision alter in the switch in time that save nine president roosevelt s ill-starred but in effect victorious court-packing plan the imprimatur of judicial approval that be finally place upon social legislation of great importance however be the content of those program which have have and be have enormous consequence for the american people labor relation have be transform income security have become a standardize feature of political platform and all the many facet of the american version of the welfare state have become part of the conventional wisdom a national consensus of near unanimity exist that these governmental effort be desirable a well a necessary ratify in the republican party victory in 1952 the positive state be now evidence by political campaign be wage not on whether but on how much social legislation there should be the general acceptance of the idea of governmental ie societal responsibility for the economic well-being of the american people be surely one of the two most significant watershed in american constitutional history the other of course be the civil war the conflict which a century ago insure national unity over fragmentation a third one of at least equal and perhaps even great importance be now be traverse american immersion and involvement in world affair internal national responsibility now a truism need not be document nevertheless it may be helpful to cite one example that of employment for a will be show below it cut across both facet of the new concept thirty year ago while the nation be wallow in economic depression the prevail philosophy of government be to stand aside and allow natural force to operate and cure the distress that guide principle of the hoover administration fall to the siege gun of the new deal less than a score of year late congress enact the employment act of 1946 by which the national government assume the responsibility of take action to insure condition of maximum employment hands-off the economy be replace by conscious guidance through plan the economic side of the constitutional revolution in 1961 the first important legislative victory of the kennedy administration come when the principle of national responsibility for local economic distress win out over a states-responsibility proposal provision be make for payment for unemployment relief by nation-wide taxation rather than by a levy only on those state afflict with manpower surplus the american people have indeed come a long way in the brief interval between 1930 and 1961 internal national responsibility be a societal response to the impact of the industrial revolution reduce to it simple term it be an assumption of a collective duty to compensate for the inability of individual to cope with the rigor of the era national responsibility for individual welfare be a concept not limit to the unite state or even to the western nation a measure of it widespread acceptance may be derive from a statement of the international congress of jurist in 1959 meet in new delhi under the auspices of the international commission of jurist a body of lawyer from the free world the congress redefine and expand the traditional rule of law to include affirmative governmental duty it be noteworthy that the majority of the delegate to the congress be from the less develop former colonial nation the rule of law historically a principle accord everyone he day in court before an impartial tribunal be broaden substantively by make it a responsibility of government to promote individual welfare recognize that the rule of law be a dynamic concept which should be employ not only to safeguard the civil and political right of the individual in a free society the congress assert that it also include the responsibility to establish social economic educational and cultural condition under which he legitimate aspiration and dignity may be realize the idea of national responsibility thus have become a common feature of the nation of the non-soviet world for good or for bad we all now live in welfare state the organize principle of which be collective responsibility for individual well-being whether a concept analogous to the principle of internal responsibility operate in a nation s external relation be less obvious and more difficult to establish the hypothesis venture here be that it do and that evidence be accumulate validate that proposition the content be not the same however rather than individual security it be the security and continue existence of an ideological group those in the free world that be basic external national responsibility involve a burgeon requirement that the leader of the western nation so guide they decision a to far the viability of other friendly nation if internal responsibility suggest acceptance of the socialist ideal of equality then external responsibility imply adherence to principle of ideological supranationalism reference to two other concept nationalism and sovereignty may help to reveal the contour of the new principle in it beginning the nation-state have to struggle to assert itself internally against feudal group and externally against the power and influence of such other claimant for loyalty a the church the breakup of the holy roman empire and the downfall of feudalism lead not more than two century ago to the surge of nationalism since the time-span of the nation-state coincide roughly with the separate existence of the unite state a an independent entity it be perhaps natural for american to think of the nation a representative of the high form of order something permanent and unchanging the concept of nationalism be the political principle that epitomize and glorify the territorial state a the characteristic type of socal structure but it be more than that for it include the emotional tie that bind man to they homeland and the complex motivation that hold a large group of people together a a unit today a new nation rise from the former colonial empire nationalism be one of the hurricane force loose in the world almost febrile in intensity the principle have become worldwide in application unfortunately at the very time that nationalist fervors can wreak great harm historically however the concept be one that have be of mark benefit to the people of the western civilizational group by subdue disparate lesser group the nation have to some degree at least broaden the capacity for individual liberty within they confine moreover technological and industrial growth have proceed at an accelerate pace thus increase the cornucopia from which material want can be satisfy while the pattern be uneven some have gain more than other nationalism have in fact serve the western people well whether historical nationalism help the people of the remainder of the world and whether today s nationalism in the former colonial area have equally beneficial aspect be other question it be one of the ironic quirk of history that the viability and usefulness of nationalism and the territorial state be rapidly dissipate at precisely the time that the nation-state attain it high number approximately 100 but it be more than irony one of the main reason why nationalism be no long a tenable concept be because it have spread throughout the planet in other word nationalism work well enough when it have limit application both a to geography and a to population it become a perilous anachronism when adopt on a world-wide basis complement the political principle of nationalism be the legal principle of sovereignty the former receive it legitimacy from the latter operate side by side together they help shore up the nation-state while sovereignty have root in antiquity in it present usage it be essentially modern jeans bodin write in the sixteenth century may have be the seminal thinker but it be the vastly influential john austin who set out the main line of the concept a now understand austin s nineteenth-century view of law and sovereignty still dominate much of today s legal and political think to he law be the command of the sovereign the english monarch who personify the power of the nation while sovereignty be the power to make law ie to prevail over internal group and to be free from the command of other sovereign in other nation these fundamental idea the indivisibility of sovereignty and it dual internal-external aspect still remain the core of that concept of ultimate political power the nation-state then exemplify the principle of nationalism and exercise sovereignty supreme power over domestic affair and independence from outside control in fact however both principle have always be nebulous and loosely define high-level abstraction be always difficult to pin down with precision that be particularly true of sovereignty when it be apply to democratic society in which popular sovereignty be say to exist and in federal nation in which the job of government be split nevertheless nationalism and sovereignty be repute in the accept wisdom to describe the modern world be there a different reality behind the facade do the surface hide a quite different picture the short answer to those question be yes both concept be undergo alteration to some degree they be be supplant by a concept of national responsibility a evidence to support that view consider the follow illustrative instance
