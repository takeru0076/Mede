television have yet to work out a live arrangement with jazz which come to the medium more a an uneasy guest than a a relax member of the family there seem to be an unfortunate assumption that an hour of chicago-style jazz in prime even time for example could not be justify without the trimming of a portentous documentary at least this seem to be the work hypothesis for chicago and all that jazz present on nbc-tv nov 26 the program come out of the nbc special project department and be slot in the do pont show of the week series perhaps special project necessarily think along documentary line if so it might be worth while to assign a future jazz show to a different department one with enough confidence in the musical material to cut down on the number of performer and give they a little room to display they talent a a matter of fact this latter approach have already be try and with please result a few year ago a timex all-star jazz show offer a broad range of style range from lionel hampton s big band to the free-wheeling duke of dixieland an enthusiastic audience confirm the live character of the hour and provide the interaction between musician and hearer which almost always seem to improve the quality of performance about that same time john crosby s tv series on the popular art prove again that give jazz ample breathe space be one of the most sensible thing a producer can do in an hour remember for it almost rudderless movement a score of jazz luminary go before the camera for lengthy period the program have be arrange to permit the establishment of a mood of intense concentration on the music camera stare at soloist face in extreme closeup then considerately pull back for full view of ensemble work chicago and all that jazz could not be fault on the choice of artist some of the in-person performer be jack teagarden gene krupa bud freeman pee we russell johnny st cyr joe sullivan red allen lil armstrong blossom seeley the jazz buff could hardly ask for more furthermore garry moore make an ideal master of ceremony he play host at the timex show already mention one of the script s big problem be how to blend picture and music of the past with live performance by musician of today nbc have gather a lot of historical material which it be eager to share for example there be sheet music with the word jazz in the title to illustrate how a word of uncertain origin take hold sample zoom into closeup range in regular succession like telephone pole pass on the highway while representative music reinforce the mood of the late teen and 1920 s however well choose and cleverly arrange such memorabilia unfortunately amount to more of an interruption than an auxiliary to the even s main business which consider the talent at hand should probably have be the gather of fresh sample of the chicago style another source of nbc pride be it rare film clip of bix beiderbecke but this view of the great trumpete fly by so fast that a prolong wink would have blot out the entire glimpse similarly in present still photograph of early jazz group the program allow no time for a close perusal chicago and all that jazz may have wind up satisfy neither the confirm fan nor the inquisitive newcomer by try to be both a serious survey of a bygone era and a showcase for today s artist the program turn out to be a not-quite-perfect example of either still the network s willingness to experiment in this musical field be to be commend and future essay happily anticipate even joan sutherland may not have anticipate the tremendous reception she receive from the metropolitan opera audience attend she debut a lucia in donizetti s lucia di lammermoor sunday night the crowd stage it own mad scene in salvo of cheer and applause and finally a stand ovation a miss sutherland take curtain call after curtain call follow a fantastic mad scene create on she own and with the help of the composer and the other performer she entrance in scene 2 act 1 bring some disconcert applause even before she have sing a note thereafter the audience wax applause-happy but discriminate operagoers reserve judgment a she sing show sign of strain she musicianship some questionable procedure and she act uncomfortable stylization a she gain composure during the second act she technical resourcefulness emerge strong though she have already reveal a trill almost unprecedented in year of performance of lucia she top the sextet brilliantly each high note have the crowd in ecstasy so that it stop the show midway in the mad scene but the real reason be a realization of the extraordinary performance unfold at the moment miss sutherland appear almost a another person in this scene a much more girlish lucia a sensational coloratura who run across stage while sing and an actress immerse in she role what follow the outburst bring almost breathless silence a miss sutherland reveal she mastery of a voice probably unique among soprano today this big flexible voice with uncommon range have be superbly discipline nervousness at the start must have cause the blemish of she first scene or she may warm up slowly in the fullness of she vocal splendor however she could sing the famous scene magnificently technically it be fascinate aurally spell-binding and dramatically quite realistic many year have pass since a metropolitan audience hear anything comparable she debut over perhaps the early scene will emerge equally fine the performance also mark the debut of a most promise young conductor silvio varviso he inject more vitality into the score than it have reveal in many year he may respect too much the italian tradition of let singer hold on to they note but to restrain they in a singer opera may be quite difficult richard tucker sing edgardo in glorious voice he bel canto style give the performance a special distinction the remainder of the cast fulfil it assignment no more than satisfactorily just a the old production and limit stage direction prove only serviceable miss sutherland first sing lucia at covent garden in 1959 the first metropolitan opera broadcast on dec 9 will introduce she a lucia she have since turn to bellini whose opera beatrice di tenda in a concert version with the american opera society introduce she to new york last season she will sing la sonambula with it here next week anyone for musical ping-pong it s really quite fun a long a you like game you will need a stereo music system with speaker preferably place at least seven or eight foot apart and one or more of the new london phase 4 record there be 12 of these to choose from all of they of popular music except for the star release pass in review sp-44001 this feature the march song of several nation record a though the various national band be march by you review stand complete with crowd effect interruption by jet plane and sundry other touch of realism this disc display london s new technique to the good effect all of the jacket carry a fairly technical and detail explanation of this new record program no reference be make to the possibility of record other than popular music in this manner and it would not seem to lend itself well to serious music directionality be greatly exaggerate most of the time but when the sound of the two speaker be allow to mix there be excellent depth and dimension to the music you definitely hear some of the instrument close up and other far back with the difference in placement apparently more distinct than would result from the near instrument merely be loud than the one far back this be a characteristic of good stereo record and one of it tremendous advantage over monaural sound london explain that the very distinct directional effect in the phase 4 series be due in large part to they novel method of microphoning and record the music on a number of separate tape channel these be then mix by they sound engineer with the active co-operation of the musical staff and combine into the final two channel which be impress on the record in some of the number the instrumental part have even be record at different time and then late combine on the master tape to produce special effect some clue to the character of london s approach in these disc may be gain immediately from the fact that ten of the 12 title include the word percussion or percussive drum xylophone castanet and other percussive instrument be reproduce remarkably well only too often however you have the feel that you be sit in a room with some of the instrument line up on one wall to you leave and other face they on the wall to you right they be definitely in the same room with you but you head start to swing a though you be sit on the very edge of a tennis court watch a spirit volley the percussive twenties sp-44006 stir pleasant memory with well-known song of that day and johnny keating s kombo give forth with tingle jazz in percussive mood sp-44005 big band percussion sp-44002 seem one of the least attractive disc the arrangement just do nt have so much character a the other there be an extraordinary sense of presence in all of these recording apparently obtain at least in part by emphasize the middle and high frequency the penalty for this be noticeable in the big bold brilliant but brassy piano sound in melody and percussion for two piano sp-44007 all of the release however be record at a gratifyingly high level with resultant mask of any surface noise pass in review practically guarantee enjoyment and be a dramatic demonstration of the potentiality of any stereo music system many hollywood film manage somehow to be authentic but not realistic strange but true authenticity and realism often be nt relate at all almost every film bear the imprimatur of hollywood be physically authentic in fact impeccably so in any give period piece the costume bric-a-brac vehicle and decor bear the stamp of unimpeachable authenticity the major studio maintain a cadre of film librarian and research specialist who look to this matter during the make recently of an important biblical film some 40 volume of research material and sketch not only of costume and interior but of architectural development sport arena vehicle and other paraphernalia be compile consult and comply with but alas the authenticity seem to stop at the set s edge the drama itself and this seem to be lavishly true of biblical drama often have hardly any relationship with authenticity at all the storyline in sort be wildly unrealistic thus in the story of ruth we have ruth naomi and boaz and set that be meticulously authentic but except for a vague adherence to the basic storyline ie that ruth remain with naomi and finally wind up with boaz the film version have little to do with the bible and in the new king of king the plot involve intrigue and twist and turn that can not be trace to the gospel early this month edward r murrow director of the unite state information agency come to hollywood and have dinner with more than 100 leader of the motion picture industry he talk about unauthentic storyline too he intimate that they be nt do the country much good in the cold war and to an industry that pride itself on authenticity he urge great realism in many corner of the globe he say the major source of impression about this country be in the movie they meet would we want a future-day gibbon or macaulay recount the saga of america with movie a he prime source of knowledge yet for much of the globe hollywood be just that prime if not sole source of knowledge if a man totally ignorant of america be to judge we land and it civilization base on hollywood alone what conclusion do you think he might come to
