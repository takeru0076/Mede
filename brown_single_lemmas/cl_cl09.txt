maude s long nose unexpectedly wrinkle up happen to be in the hall happen to hear you quarrel about she oh well you can nt really blame lolotte she lose she beau to you but she be talk of emile when she see the black line of the open door sarah remember it clearly maude go on i ve get to get busy miss celie s take to she bed with the door lock she open it an inch and poke out the key for i to give you here she thrust a bundle of key string on a thick red cord into sarah s hand not that there s much use in lock up the smokehouse and the storehouse now drink you coffee coffee it s cold maude suddenly look quite capable of pour it down she throat i do nt want it sarah say firmly oh well i ll take it down with i a i go maude swoop up the cup and hike up she top hoop a if about to take off with a race start at the door she turn back she roman nose look very long now and satiric i forget ben and lucien have go after they it s just like that book you northern friend write except there be nt any ice floe to cross and no bloodhound i do nt know mrs stowe what can they do if they find they they can nt do anything it s silly childish run after they like that i tell ben so but of course the paterollers will nt be of any help not with everything so upset and that yankee cavalry outfit they say be run around god know where she have swish away she have be go for a long time probably when sarah suddenly realize that she ought to stop she pour out the coffee so no one would drink it but then the so-called coffee be bad enough at good cold it be all but undrinkable especially that cup she be deeply horribly sure that lucien have fill it with opium she have quarreled with lucien she have resist he demand for money and if she die by the provision of she marriage contract lucien would inherit legally not only the immediate sum of gold under the floorboard in the office but late when the war be over she father s entire estate she feel cold and hot sticky and chilly at the same time now wait a minute she tell herself think about it lucien be not the only person in this house who could have put opium in that coffee she have lose a bottle of opium but that be on the trip from new orleans or someone have take it during she first day at honotassa yes she have miss it after she talk with emile after dinner just before emile be shoot rilly or glendora have enter she room while she sleep bring back she wash clothe so somebody else could have come in too then or late while she be out of the room it would have be easy to identify a opium by it odor it be not very reasonable to believe that lucien have procure unprocurable opium and come back to honotassa with a form plan to murder she he do nt even know that she be there and he certainly could nt have guess that she would resist he demand for the gold or that she be not the yield yes and credible fool he have every right to expect no he have be surprise unpleasantly surprise but surprise then somebody else do nt question rev have say do nt invite danger she skin crawl lolotte have tell maude that she be in the hall and the door be open sarah have begin to tell lucien of emile she have begin to question and a little draft have creep across the room from the bedroom door open barely enough to show a rim of blackness in the hall so lolotte or anybody could have listen and that somebody could have already be supply with the miss bottle of opium that be not reasonable either the opium have disappear before emile s death and whoever shoot he could not by any stretch of the imagination have foresee sarah s own doubt and suspicion and question she begin to doubt whether there have be in fact a lethal dose of opium in the cup so suppose somebody only wish to frighten she so she would leave honotassa that make a certain amount of logic add to the argument be the fact that while she might have taste the coffee if it have be still hot she might even have drink some of it she would nt have take enough to kill she for she would have be warn by it taste no it be merely an attempt to frighten she she would nt go back to new york a maude suggest she would nt run like a scare cat but well she d be very careful she dress and the accustom routine restore to she a sense of normal everyday life but before she leave she room she dig into she big moire bag take out the envelope hold she marriage contract and the wax seal have be break so somebody else know what would happen to she father s money if she die rev have know all along rev do nt need to break the wax seal read the contract and find out he could conceivably have wish to make sure rev love honotassa it be like a part of he breath and body rev have stress the need for money rev would never have try to give she poison she thrust the envelope back in the bag there be no point in lock it up in the armoire now it be like lock the barn after the horse be steal and in all likelihood by now there be more than one person in the house who know the term of she marriage contract there be no point either in tell herself again what a fool she d be she go downstairs and receive another curious shock for when glendora flap into the dine room in she homemade moccasin sarah ask she when she have bring coffee to she room and glendora say she have nt too much work this morning miss sarah everybody go like that sarah swallow past another kind of constriction in she throat well then who bring it miss maude she come to the kitchen and say she take it up to you glendora put down a dish of lukewarm rice not much breakfast this morning i do nt know what we re go to do miss sarah we ve get to eat sarah say curtly because a chill crawl over she again maude glendora flap away the rice be nt dose with opium indeed it have no taste at all not a grain of salt she eat what she could and go out along the cover passageway with the rain drip from the vine in the kitchen glendora be despairingly pick chicken get a basket sarah tell she we ll go to the storehouse glendora drop a chicken and a flurry of feather and go with she through the drizzle to the storehouse sarah find the right key and unlock the door it be a long low room like a root cellar for it be bank up with soil and vine have run rampant over that too it be dark but dry and cool she dole out what glendora vaguely guess be the right amount of dry pea egg cornmeal a little salt the shelf look empty than when miss celie have show she the storeroom and since the man from the commissary have call there be certainly now fewer mouth to feed but there be less to feed they with she take glendora to the smokehouse unlock it and see with satisfaction there be still a quantity of ham and side of bacon hang from the smoke-stained rafter they would nt go hungry not yet and the field be green and grow can nt you possibly imagine what life be go to be like here maude have say maude she send glendora back to the house she basket and she apron load she stand for a moment rain drip from the tree over she head think of maude maude have the opportunity to take the bottle of opium from sarah s room maude have the cool ruthlessness to do whatever she make up she mind to do she could nt see how she death could affect maude she could nt see any reason why maude would attempt to frighten she besides there be something hysterical and silly something almost childish about an attempt to frighten she maude be neither hysterical nor silly and sarah rather doubt if she have ever be childish yet maude have suggest that sarah return to new york maude could have shoot emile if she d have a reason to kill he there be no use in stand there in the drizzle try to find a link between emile s murder and opium in a cup of coffee she start back for the house see a light in the office open the door and surprise a domestic little scene which be far outside the dark realm of murder or attempt murder rev george and lolotte be mend shoe a light lamp stand on the table that dusky drizzle day they be all three bend over a shabby ride boot george have a tack hammer lolotte hold a patch of leather rev steady something a tiny brad wait for george s poise hammer george say first thing i do when i get to vicksburg again be get i a yankee with boot on lolotte laugh softly rev look up and see she lolotte look up and stiffen george do nt look up at all there be no way to know no way to guess whether any one of they be surprise at sarah s appearance believe she to be drug and senseless and just possibly dead rev say come in sarah reckon you know the news and what news sarah think a satirically a maude might have say it rev s face be suddenly a little fix and question he turn to george and lolotte take you cobbler s shop somewhere else i want to talk to sarah everything in the office the spread circle of lamplight the patch of leather in lolotte s hand george poise with the tack hammer the homely everyday atmosphere all deny an attempt at murder a rush of panic catch sarah no not now i mean i ve get to to see to the kitchen glendora she word jumble together and she all but run from the office and from the question in rev s face now why do i do that she think a warm drizzle rain touch she face she be no schoolgirl refuse to bear tale a she reach the kitchen door the answer present itself if she tell anyone of the opium it must be lucien she husband it might be indeed it have already prove to be a marriage without love but it be marriage so she could nt choose rev a a confidant it must be lucien always provide that lucien himself have not dose she coffee with opium she think a coldly and sharply again a maude might have say it she pause at the kitchen door catch she breath tell herself firmly that the opium be only an attempt to frighten she and go into the kitchen where glendora be eye the chicken dismally and maude be clean lamp chimney glendora give a gulp miss sarah i can nt cut up no chicken miss maude say she will nt again the homely everyday detail of daily live refute a vicious attempt to frighten she or to murder she the homely everyday detail of live and domestic requirement also press upon she with they immediate urgency no matter what have happen or have nt happen somebody have to see about dinner she eye the chicken with if she have know it something of glendora s dismal look and think with a certain fury of the time she have spend on latin verb
