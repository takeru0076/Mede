there have be sign and portent like the regular topple over and deface of the bust of lauro di bosis near the villa lante and in the gianicolo something be happen all right slowly it be true but you could feel it the italian feel it little thing an italian poet have notice plainclothes policeman lounge around the area of quirinal palace the first time since the war at least they have nt step up and ask to see paper in the hate flat dialect mispronunciation of mussolini s home district dogumenti per favore but who know that might be come one of these day there be other italian who still bear scar they have earn in police station basement resist they laugh and true to national form and manner never talk long or solemnly on any subject at all but some of they worry out loud about short memory and ghost we see giuseppe berto at a party once in a while tall lean nervous and handsome and in we opinion the good novelist of they all except pavese and pavese be dead berto s the sky be red have be a small masterpiece and in it special way the good book to come out of the war now he be marry to a beautiful girl have a small son and live in an expensive apartment and work for the movie on he desk be a slowly accumulate treatment and script of the count of monte cristo on he bookshelves be some of the late american novel include bellow s seize the day but he have nt read they they be send by american publisher and be nt especially interest in what the american writer be up to he be interest in robert musil s the man without quality so be a lot of other people he be interest in italo svevo he be think he way into a new novel a big one one that people have be wait for it be go to be hard go all the way because he have nt write seriously for a while except for a few story be tire of the old method of realismo he have so successfully use in the sky be red this one be go to be different he have buy a little piece of property down along the coast of the hard country of calabria that he know so well he be go to do one or two more film for cash and then chuck it all leave rome and it intellectual clique and money-fed life go back to calabria berto seem worry too he know all about it and have put it down in journal form in the war in a black shirt a wonderful book not for some strange reason publish in the we he know all about the appeal of a black shirt and jackboot to a poor southern peasant boy he know all about the infection and the fever and too the moment of realization when he see for himself throw up he hand and quit end the war a a prisoner in texas berto know all about fascism so do he friend the young novelist rimanelli rimanelli be tough and square-built and adventurous say what he think he have put it down in a war novel the day of the lion these people be not talk much about it but you a foreigner sense they apprehension and disappointment so there we be talk around and about it the english lady say she have to go to vienna for a while it be a pity because she have plan to lie a wreath at the foot of the garibaldi statue tower over rome in spectacular benediction from the highpoint of the gianicolo around that statue in the green park where child play and lover walk in twos and there be a glow view of the whole city in that park be the row of marble bust of garibaldi s fall man the one who one day rush out of the porta san pancrazio and under fire all the way up the long straight narrow lane to take then lose the high ground of the villa doria pamphili when they lose it the french artillery move in and that be the end for garibaldi that time on 30 april 1849 once out of the gate they have charge straight up the narrow lane we have walk it many time and shiver figure what a fish barrel it have be for the french now the park be fill with marble bust and all the street in the immediate area have the full and proper name of the man who fall we be at a party once and hear an idealistic young european call that awful charge glorious we companion be a huge plain-spoken american sculptor who have be a sixteen-year-old rifleman all across france in 1944 he say it be stupid butchery to order man to make a charge like that no matter who give the order and what for oh it would be butchery all right the european say we would see it that way but it be glorious then it be the last time in history anybody could do something gloriously like that i think who be old now old world and new world the sculptor look at he bugeyed and amaze angry he have make an assault once with 180 man it be a pick assault company they go up against an ss unit of comparable size over a little rise of ground over an open field object a village crossroads they make it kill every last one of the kraut take the village on schedule when it be over eight of he company be still alive and all eight be wound the whole thing from the moment when they jump heavily off the truck spread out and move into position just behind the cover of that slight rise of ground and then jump off take maybe between twenty and thirty minute the sculptor look at he let the color drain out of he face grin and look down into he drink a bad martini make with raw italian gin bullshit he say softly excuse i the european say i be not familiar with the expression the apartment where we be talk that afternoon in march face onto the street garibaldi s man have charge up and along across the way from the apartment build be a ruine house shoot to hell that day in 1849 and leave that way a a memorial there be a bronze wreath on the wall like everything else in rome ruin and monument alike that house be live in i have see diaper string across the ruine roof the english lady really want to put a wreath on the garibaldi monument on the 30th of april she have she reason for this for one thing there be nt go to be any ceremony at all this year there be a few reason for that too garibaldi have be take up and exploit by the communist nowadays therefore the government want no part of he it be sort of a if we government should decide to disown washington or lincoln for the same reason and then there be ecclesiastical matter the matter of garibaldi s anti-clericalism there be a new pope and the vatican be make itself hear and feel these day a it happen the english lady be a good catholic herself but of more liberal political persuasion nothing be go to be do this year to celebrate garibaldi s bold and unsuccessful defense of rome all that the english lady want to do be to walk up to the monument and lie a wreath at it base this would show that somebody even a foreigner live in rome care and then there be other thing some of the marble bust in the park be of young englishman who fight and die for garibaldi she also mention leave a little bunch of flower at the bust of lauro di bosis it be hard for i to know how i feel about lauro di bosis i suffer from mix feeling he be a well-to-do handsome and sensitive young poet he bust show an intense mustached fine-featured face he fly over rome one day during the early day of mussolini and scatter leaflet over the city denounce the fascist he be never hear of again he be think either to have be kill by the fascist a soon a he land or to have kill himself by fly out to sea and crash he plane he be thus an early and spectacular victim and there be something so wonderfully romantic about it all he really do nt know how to fly he have crash on takeoff once before gossip have it for gossip be the soul of rome that a famous american dancer of the time have pay for both the plane it be absurd and dramatic it be remember and have be commemorate by a bust in a park and a square in the city which be rename piazzo lauro di bosis after the war most roman even some postman know it by the old name face with a gesture like di bosis i find usually that i sentiment be close to those of i sculptor friend the thing that happen in police station basement be dirty grubby and most often anonymous no poetry no airplane no dancer that be how the real routine of resistance go on and it strength be directly proportionate to the number of insignificant people who can let themselves be take to piece piece by piece without quit it be an ugly business and there be few if any wreath for they i keep think of a young woman i know during the occupation in austria she be from prague she have be pick up by the russian question in connection with some pamphlet sentence to life imprisonment for espionage she escape crawl through the usual i field under barbed wire be shoot at swim a river and we finally pick she up in linz she show we what have happen to she no airplane no nathan hale statement just no spot not even a dimesize spot on she whole body that be nt bruise bruise on top of bruise from beating i understand very well about lauro di bosis and how he action be symbolic the trouble be that like many symbol it do nt seem a very realistic one the english lady want to pay tribute to garibaldi and to lauro di bosis but she be nt go to be here to do it be any of we interest enough in the idea to do it for she by proxy so to speak there be a pretty thorough silence at that point i spoon stir coffee bang against the side of the cup sound a loud a a bell i think what the hell why not i say i would do it for she i have some reason too i admire the english lady i hate embarrass silence and have be know to make a fool out of myself just to prevent one i also have and have feeling about garibaldi like every southerner i can nt escape the romantic tradition of brave defeat forlorn lose cause though garibaldi s fight be small shake compare to pickett s charge which like all southerner i view in almost miltonic term fall angel etc i associate the two and to top it all i be often sentimental on purpose try to prove to myself that i be not afraid of sentiment so much for all that the english lady be please and enthusiastic she give i the name of some people who would surely help pay for the flower and might even march up to the monument with i the idea of the march please she maybe twenty thirty fifty maybe i could call rimanelli at the magazine rottosei where he work
