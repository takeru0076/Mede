over the rattle of fender hum of tire and chatter of gear there be a charm melody of whisper and tiny giggle cool air move slowly through the open or smashed-out side window hint of bloom roadside vegetation and occasionally a faint fragrance of perfume swirl from the back seat moriarty i driver suddenly exclaim with something so definite so final in he tone i once more repeat the absurdity muster all i latent power of hypocrisy to sound convince we be come to an intersection turn right chuff to a stop force to realize that this be the end of a very short line i scan a road marker and

smile with i host s daughter i wave with discretion and moderation to the vague golden face fade through rise dust and the distortion of the back window glass then i see the father s head slightly turn gauche rainbow shape replace the poignant oval of gold auto whizz past white-shirted and conservatively-cravated driver stare conspicuously toward the eastern horizon and past i supplicate and accuse gaze suddenly a treble auto horn tootley-toot-tootled and thumb hopefully i see emergent in windshield flash red lip stream silk of blonde hair and ah tremble confusion of hope apprehension

grandfather of senor moriarty s ford sedan come screech to a dust-swirling stop and a word face appear it nose threaten by shard of what have once be the side window get in buddy get in the straight black hair flop in a vigorous nod the slender nose plunge toward glass tooth and draw safely back johnson unwired the right hand door whose window be like the leave one merely loosely-taped fragment of glass and johnson wad himself into a narrow seat make still more narrow by three case of beer in back buddy the driver say to i quickly but carefully lower i duffel bag over the low side-rack i step on the run board it flop down spring back up and gouge i shin the truck be hurtle forward i seize the rack and make a western-style flying-mount just in time one of i knee mercifully land on i duffel bag and merely wreck i camera i be to discover late i other knee land on the slivery truck floor board and but this be no medical report i be again in motion and at a speed which bely the truck s similarity to senor x s ford turtle maybe i would beat old herry to siberia after all whatever satisfaction that might offer something pull i leg i draw back draw back i foot for a kick but it be only johnson reach around the wire chicken fence which half cover the truck cab s glassless rear window the way he red rubber lip be stretch across he pearly little tooth i think he be only have a little joke but no he want i to bend down from the roar of wind so he could roar something into i ear wann- a beer hell yes i roar back between dusty lip do i want a beer do an anteater want ant bueno amigo gracias i holler i first long swallow fill i with confidence and immediately double the size of i spanish vocabulary at once i ear be drown by a flow of what i take to be spanish but the driver s white tooth flash at i the road wildly veer beyond he glisten hair beyond he gesticulate bottle it could have be the pure oxford english i be half hear i would nt have know the difference johnson be try to grab the wheel though the swerve of the truck be throw he away from it white tooth suddenly vanish the driver slam the side of he bottle against johnson s ear we be off the road gleam barbed wire pull taut i duck just a the first strand break somewhere down the line and come whip over the sideboard we be in a field in a tight screech turn prairie dog be pop up and pop down when i fall on i back i see a vulture hover just a i get to i knee there be again the sound of the fence stretch and i have time only to start take i kneel posture seriously this time no wire come whip into the truck we be back on the road i regain i squat position behind the truck cab s rear window johnson s leave hand be press against the side of he head red cheek whiten beneath he finger tee-wah the driver cackle he black eye glitter behind dull silver chicken fence that be tee-wah i be talk you think i be a mexican do nt you buddy i nod hell that s all right buddy the indian i now guess say drink you beer miraculously the bottle be still in i hand foam still geysering over i luckily waterproof watch no sooner have i start drink than the driver start zigzag the truck the beer foam furiously i drink furiously a long time empty the bottle tooth again flash back at i the driver release a deluge of spanish in which amigo appear every so often like an island in the stormy wave of surround sound i bob i head each time it appear suddenly the spanish become an english in which only one word emerge with clarity and precision son of a bitch sometimes hyphenated by vicious jab of a beer bottle into johnson s quiver rib a big car be approach it chrome tooth grin beyond it the gray road stretch a long long way the car be just about to we it driver s fat solemn face intent on the road ahead on business on a family in sante fe on anything but an old pick-up truck in which two human being desperately need rescue i toss the bottle high so it would only bounce harmlessly but loudly off the car s steel roof too high on unoccupied roadway the bottle shatter into a small amber flash aye-yah-ah-ah the indian be again raise he bottle but to i astonish relief probably only a fraction of johnson s the bottle this time go to the indian s lip another car be come a tiny dark shape on a far hill i start look on the splintery truck bed for a piece of board a dirt clod anything i could throw and with good aim than i have throw the beer bottle we be slow in the ditch sand be white and soft-looking only an occasional pebble discernible faintly gleam but johnson could nt quickly unwire the truck door and if i escape he might suffer the car be approach fast on the truck bed there be nothing small than a piece of rusty machinery with more time i could have loosen a small burr or cotter pin suddenly and not a second too soon i think of the coin in i pocket there be no time to pick out a penny i get a coin between i thumb and forefinger lean i elbow in a very natural and casual manner on top of the truck cab and flip i little missile there be a blur just under i focus of vision a crash the car s far windshield panel turn into a silver web with a dark hole in the center i hear the screech of brake behind i an insane burst of laughter beneath i look back i see a gray-haired man get out of he halt car and try to read we license number s-s-sahjunt johnson s fat hand another bottle be protrude from the truck cab and that self-proclaimed baptist teetotaler have a bottle at he own lip two car come over a crest they chrome and glass flash the indian s arm whip sidewise there be a flash of amber and froth the crash of the bottle shatter against the side of the first car brake shriek behind we i see johnson s bottle snatch from he hand see it go in a swirl of foam just behind the second car this time there be no sound of brake but the shriek of woman i look back at pale oval frame in the elongate oval of the car s rear window drink you son of a bitch i quickly turn around and begin to drink but the indian be jab another bottle toward johnson
