the expense and time involve be astronomical however we send a third vessel out a much small and fast one than the first two we have learn much about interstellar drive since a hundred year ago that be all i can tell you about they but the third ship come back several year ago and report that it have find a planet on which human being could live and which be already inhabit by sentient being say hal forget in he enthusiasm that he have not be ask to speak macneff stop pace to stare at hal with he pale blue eye how do you know he say sharply forgive i sandalphon say hal but it be inevitable do not the forerunner predict in he time and the world line that such a planet would be find i believe it be on page 573 macneff smile and say i be glad that you scriptural lesson have leave such an impression how could they not think hal besides they be not the only impression i still bear scar on i back where pornsen i gapt whip i because i have not learn i lesson well enough he be a good impresser that pornsen be be a i grow old and be promote so be he always where i be he be i gapt in the creche he be the dormitory gapt when i go to college and think i be get away from he he be now i block gapt he be the one responsible for i get such low m r s swiftly come the revulsion the protest no not he for i and i alone be responsible for whatever happen to i if i get a low mr i do so because i want it that way or i dark self do if i die i die because i will it so so forgive i sigmen for the contrary-to-reality thought please pardon i again sandalphon say hal but do the expedition find any record of the forerunner have be on this planet perhaps even though this be too much to wish find the forerunner himself no say macneff though that do not mean that there may not be such record there the expedition be under order to make a swift survey of condition and then to return to earth i cant tell you now the distance in lightyear or what star this be though you can see it with the naked eye at night in this hemisphere if you volunteer you will be tell where you re go after the ship leave and it leave very soon you need a linguist say hal the ship be huge say macneff but the number of military man and specialist we be take limit the linguist to one we have consider several of you professional because they be lamechians and above suspicion unfortunately hal wait macneff pace some more frown then he say unfortunately only one lamechian linguist exist and he be too old for this expedition therefore a thousand pardon say hal but i have just think of one thing i be marry no problem at all say macneff there will be no woman aboard the gabriel and if a man be marry he will automatically be give a divorce hal gasp and he say a divorce macneff raise he hand apologetically and say you be horrify of course but from we read of the western talmud we urielites believe that the forerunner know this situation would arise make reference to and provision for divorce it s inevitable in this case for the couple will be separate for at the least forty year naturally he couch the provision in obscure language in he great and glorious wisdom he know that we enemy the israelite must not be able to read therein what we plan i volunteer say hal tell i more sandalphon six month late hal yarrow stand in the observation dome of the gabriel and watch the ball of earth dwindle above he it be night on this hemisphere but the light blaze from the megalopolises of australia japan china southeast asia india siberia hal the linguist see the glitter disc and necklace in term of the language speak therein australia the philippine island japan and northern china be inhabit by those member of the haijac union that speak american southern china all of southeast asia southern india and ceylon these state of the malay federation speak bazaar siberia speak icelandic he mind turn the globe swiftly for he and he visualize africa which use swahili south of the sahara sea all around the mediterranean sea asia minor northern india and tibet hebrew be the native tongue in southern europe between the israeli republic and the icelandic-speaking people of northern europe be a thin but long stretch of territory call march this be no man s land dispute by the haijac union and the israeli republic a potential source of war for the last two hundred year neither nation would give up they claim on it yet neither wish to make any move that might lead to a second apocalyptic war so for all practical purpose it be an independent nation and by now have it own organize government unrecognized outside it own border it citizen speak all of the world s survive tongue plus a new one call lingo a pidgin whose vocabulary be derive from the other six and whose syntax be so simple it could be contain on half a sheet of paper hal see in he mind the rest of earth iceland greenland the caribbean island and the eastern half of south america here the people speak the tongue of iceland because that island have get the jump on the hawaiian-americans who be busy resettle north america and the western half of south america after the apocalyptic war then there be north america where american be the native speech of all except the twenty descendant of french-canadian live on the hudson bay preserve hal know that when that side of earth rotate into the night zone sigmen city would blaze out into space and somewhere in that enormous light be he apartment but mary would soon no long be live there for she would be notify in a few day that she husband have die in an accident while on a flight to tahiti she would weep in private he be sure for she love he in she frigid way though in public she would be dry-eyed she friend and professional associate would sympathize with she not because she have lose a beloved husband but because she have be marry to a man who think unrealistically if hal yarrow have be kill in a crash he must have want it that way there be no such thing a an accident somehow all the other passenger also suppose to have die in this web of elaborate fraud to cover up the disappearance of the personnel of the gabriel have simultaneously agree to die and therefore be in disgrace they would not be cremate and they ash fling to the wind in public ceremony no the fish could eat they body for all the sturch care hal feel sorry for mary he have a time keep the tear from well to he own eye a he stand in the crowd in the observation dome yet he tell himself this be the good way he and mary would no long have to tear and rend at each other they mutual torture would be over mary be free to marry again not know that the sturch have secretly give she a divorce think that death have dissolve she marriage she would have a year in which to make up she mind to choose a mate from a list select by she gapt perhaps the psychological barrier that have prevent she from conceive hal s child would no long be present perhaps hal doubt if this happy event would occur mary be a freeze below the navel a he no matter who the candidate for marriage select by the gapt the gapt pornsen he would no long have to see that fat face hear that whine voice hal yarrow say the whine voice and slowly feel himself icy yet burn hal turn there be the squat loose-jowled man smile lopsidedly up at he i beloved ward i perennial gadfly say the whine voice i have no idea that you too would be on this glorious voyage but i might have know we seem to be bind by love sigmen himself must have foresee it love to you i ward sigmen love you too i guardian say hal choke how wonderful to see you cherish self i have think we would never again speak to each other 5 the gabriel point towards she destination and under one-gee acceleration begin to build up towards she ultimate velocity 991 percent of the speed of light meanwhile all the personnel except those few need to carry out the performance of the ship go into the suspensor here they would lie in suspend animation for many year some time late after a check have be make of all automatic equipment the crew would join the other they would sleep while the gabriel s drive would increase the acceleration to a point which the unfrozen body of the personnel could not have endure upon reach the desire speed the automatic equipment would cut off the drive and the silent but not empty vessel would hurl towards the star which be it journey s end many year late the photon-counting apparatus in the nose of the ship would determine that the star be close enough to actuate deceleration again a force too strong for unfrozen body to endure would be apply then after slow the vessel considerably the drive would adjust to a one-gee deceleration and the crew would be automatically bring out of they suspend animation these member would then unthaw the rest of the personnel and in the half-year leave before reach they destination the man would carry out whatever preparation be need hal yarrow be among the last to go into the suspensor and among the first to come out he have to study the recording of the language of the chief nation of ozagen siddo and from the first he face a difficult task the expedition that have discover ozagen have succeed in correlate two thousand siddo word with an equal number of american word the description of the siddo syntax be very restrict and a hal find out obviously mistake in many case this discovery cause hal anxiety he duty be to write a school text and to teach the entire personnel of the gabriel how to speak ozagen yet if he use all of the little mean at he disposal he would be instruct he student wrongly moreover even get this across would be difficult for one thing the organ of speech of the ozagen native differ somewhat from earthmen s the sound make by these organ be therefore dissimilar it be true that they could be approximate but would the ozagenians understand these approximation another obstacle be the grammatical construction of siddo consider the tense system instead of inflecting a verb or use an unattached particle to indicate the past or future siddo use an entirely different word thus the masculine animate infinitive dabhumaksanigaluahai mean to live be in the perfect tense ksuupeliafo and in the future maiteipa the same use of an entirely different word apply for all the other tense plus the fact that siddo not only have the normal to earthmen three gender of masculine feminine and neuter but the two extra of inanimate and spiritual fortunately gender be inflect though the expression of it would be difficult for anybody not bear in siddo the system of indicate gender vary accord to tense all the other part of speech noun pronoun adjective adverb and conjunction operate under the same system a the verb
