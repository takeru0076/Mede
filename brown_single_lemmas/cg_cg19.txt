today the private detective will also investigate insurance claim or handle divorce case but he primary function remain what it have always be to assist those who have money in they unending struggle with those who have not it be from this unpromising background that the fictional private detective be recruit the mythological private eye differ from he counterpart in real life in two essential way on the one hand he do not work for a large agency but be almost always self-employed a a free-lance investigator the fictional detective be responsible to no one but himself and he client for this reason he appear a an independent and self-reliant figure whose rugged individualism need not be press into the mold of a 9 to 5 routine on the other hand the fictional detective do not break strike or handle divorce case no client would ever think of ask he to do such thing whatever he original assignment the fictional private eye end up by investigate and solve a crime usually a murder operate a a one man police force in fact if not in name he be at once more independent and more dedicate than the police themselves he catch criminal not merely because he be pay to do so frequently he do not receive a fee at all but because he enjoy he work because he firmly believe that murder must be punish thus the fictional detective be much more than a simple businessman he be first and foremost a defender of public moral a servant of society it be this curious blend of rugged individualism and public service which account for the great appeal of the mythological detective by virtue of he self-reliance he individualism and he freedom from external restraint the private eye be a perfect embodiment of the middle class conception of liberty which amount to do what you please and let the devil take the hindmost at the same time because the personal code of the detective coincide with the legal dictate of he society because he like to catch criminal he be in middle class eye a virtuous man in this way the private detective get the good of two possible world he be an individualist but not an anarchist he be a public servant but not a cop in short the fictional private eye be a specialize version of adam smith s ideal entrepreneur the man whose private ambition must always and everywhere promote the public welfare in the mystery story a in the wealth of nation individualism and the social good be two side of the same benevolent coin there be only one catch to this idyllic arrangement adam smith be wrong not only do the ideal entrepreneur not produce the great good for the great number he end by destroy himself by give birth to monopoly capitalism the rise of the giant corporation in western europe and the unite state date from the period 1880-1900 now although the root of the mystery story in serious literature go back a far a balzac dicken and poe it be not until the close decade of the 19th century that the private detective become an establish figure in popular fiction sherlock holmes the ancestor of all private eye be bear during the 1890s thus the transformation of adam smith s ideal entrepreneur into a mythological detective coincide closely with the decline of the real entrepreneur in economic life drive from the marketplace by the course of history we hero disguise himself a a private detective the birth of the myth compensate for the death of the ideal even on the fictional level however the contradiction which give rise to the mystery story be not fully resolve the individualism and public service of the private detective both stem from he dedication to a personal code of conduct he enforce the law without be tell to do so the private eye be therefore a moral man but he morality rest upon that of he society the basic premise of all mystery story be that the distinction between good and bad coincide with the distinction between legal and illegal unfortunately this assumption do not always hold good a capitalism in the 20th century have become increasingly dependent upon force and violence for it survival the private detective be place in a serious dilemma if he be good he may not be legal if he be legal he may not be good it be the gradual unfold and deepen of this contradiction which create the inner dialectic of the evolution of the mystery story with the advent of sir arthur conan doyle s sherlock holmes the development of the modern private detective begin sherlock holmes be not merely an individualist he be very close to be a mental case a brief list of the great detective s little idiosyncrasy would provide dr freud with ample food for think holmes be addict to the use of cocaine and other refresh stimulant he be prone to semi-catatonic trance induce by the play of the vioiln he be a recluse an incredible egotist a confirm misogynist holmes rebel against the social convention of he day not on moral but rather on aesthetic ground he eccentricity begin a a defense against boredom it be in order to avoid the stuffy routine of middle class life that holmes become a detective in the first place a he inform watson i life be spend in one long effort to escape from the commonplace of existence these little problem help i to do so holmes be a public servant to be sure but the society which he serve bore he to tear the curious relationship between holmes and scotland yard provide an important clue to the deep significance of he eccentric behavior although he be perfectly will to cooperate with scotland yard holmes have nothing but contempt for the intelligence and mentality of the police they for they part be convince that holmes be too unorthodox and theoretical to make a good detective why do the police find holmes unorthodox on the face of it it be because he employ deductive technique alien to official police routine another more interest explanation be hint at by watson when he observe on several occasion that holmes would have make a magnificent criminal the great detective modestly agree watson s insight be verify by the mysterious link between holmes and he arch-opponent dr moriarty the two man resemble each other closely in they cunning they egotism they relentlessness the first series of sherlock holmes adventure end with holmes and moriarty grapple together on the edge of a cliff they be presume to have plunge to a common grave in this fatal embrace link to holmes even in death moriarty represent the alter-ego of the great detective the image of what we hero might have become be he not a public servant just a holmes the eccentric stand behind holmes the detective so holmes the potential criminal lurk behind both in the modern english whodunnit this insinuation of latent criminality in the detective himself have almost entirely disappear hercule poirot and lord peter whimsey the respective creation of agatha christie and dorothy sayer have retain holmes egotism but not he zest for life and eccentric habit poirot and he counterpart be perfectly respectable people it be true that they be also extremely dull they dedication to the status quo have be affirm at the expense of the fascinate but dangerous individualism of a sherlock holmes the latter s real descendent be unable to take root in england they flee from the victorian parlor and make they way across the stormy atlantic in the american hardboiled detective story of the 20s and 30s the spirit of the mad genius from baker street life on like holmes the american private eye reject the social convention of he time but unlike holmes he feel he society to be not merely dull but also corrupt surround by crime and violence everywhere the hardboiled private eye can retain he purity only through a life of self-imposed isolation he alienation be far more acute than holmes he be not an eccentric but rather an outcast with rex stout s nero wolfe alienation be represent on a purely physical plane wolfe refuse to ever leave he own house and spend most of he time drink beer and play with orchid more profound and more disturb however be the moral isolation of raymond chandler s philip marlowe in a society where everything be for sale marlowe be the only man who can not be buy he tough honesty condemn he to a solitary and difficult existence beat bruise and exhaust he pursue the elusive killer through the demi-monde of high society and low moral always alone always despise in the end he get he man but no one seem to care virtue be it own and only reward a similar tone of underlie futility and despair pervade the spy thriller of eric ambler and dominate the most famous of all american mystery story dashiell hammett s the maltese falcon sam spade join force with a band of adventurer in search of a priceless jeweled statue of a falcon but when the bird be find at last it turn out to be a fake now the detective must save he own skin by inform on the girl he love who be also the real murderer for sam spade neither crime nor virtue pay moreover it be increasingly difficult to distinguish between the two because the private eye intend to save society in spite of himself he invariably find himself in trouble with the police the latter be either too stupid to catch the killer or too corrupt to care in either case they do not appreciate the private detective s zeal perry mason and hamilton burger nero wolfe and inspector cramer spend more time fight each other than they do in look for the criminal frequently enough the police be themselves in league with the killer dashiell hammett s red harvest provide a classic example of this theme but even when the police be honest they do not trust the private eye he be like phillip marlowe too alienate to be reliable finally in the maltese falcon among other the clash between detective and police be carry to it logical conclusion sam spade become the chief murder suspect in order to exonerate himself he be compel to find the real criminal who happen to be he girl friend what be only a vague suspicion in the case of sherlock holmes now appear a a direct accusation the private eye be in danger of turn into he opposite it be the grow contradiction between individualism and public service in the mystery story which create this fatal dilemma by uphold he own personal code of behavior the private detective have place himself in opposition to a society whose fabric be permeate with crime and corruption that society respond by condemn the private eye a a threat to the status quo a potential criminal if the detective insist upon retain he personal standard he must now do so in conscious defiance of he society he must in short cease to be a detective and become a rebel on the other hand if he wish to continue in he choose profession he must abandon he own code and sacrifice he precious individualism dashiell hammett resolve this contradiction by cease to write mystery story and turn to other pursuit he successor have adopt the opposite alternative in order to save the mystery story they have convert the private detective into an organization man the first of two possible variation on this theme be symbolize by mickey spillane s mike hammer at first glance this hero seem to be more rather than less of an individualist than any of he predecessor for hammer nothing be forbid he kill when he please take he woman where he find they and always act a judge jury and executioner roll into one
