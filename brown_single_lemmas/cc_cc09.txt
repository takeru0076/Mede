here a in journal mr louis have give himself the lion s share of the dance and there be no doubt that he be capable of conceive and execute a wide variety of difficult and arrest physical movement indeed both journal and signal qualify a instructive catalogue of modern-dance calisthenics but chain of movement be not necessarily communicative and it be in the realm of communication that the work prove disappoint one frequently have the feel that the order of they movement combination could be transpose without notable loss of effect there be too little suggestion of organic relationship and development it may be of course that mr louis be consciously try to create work that anticipate an age of total automation but it may be also that he be merely more mindful of athletics than of esthetics at the present time one thing be certain however and that be that he be far more slavish to the detail accent phrasing and contour of the music he deal with than a confident dance creator

four place each with it scenery and people add two diversion and conclude with a toccata for the young a refreshingly underplay interpretation of rocknroll dance the place could be anywhere the idiosyncrasy and foible observe there could be anybody s and the laugh be on we all but we need not mind too much because mr nagrin have express it through movement that be divert and clever almost all the way miss tamiris once upon a time be a problem piece about a man and a woman and the three figure that bother they somehow unfortunately the man and woman be not make to appear very interest at the outset and the menace figure fail to make they any more so nor do the dance involve really seize the attention at any time the music here russell smith s tetrameron sound good all the

passage of filigree that lace through the big moment of the open movement and the final rondo mr cliburn give the slow movement some of the quality of a chopin nocturne alfred wallenstein the conductor sensitive accompanist that he be pick up the idea and lead the orchestra here with a sense of brood poetic mystery the collaboration be remarkable a it be in both the other movement too mr wallenstein who will lead all of the concert in the cycle also conduct the leonore overture no 3 and the fourth symphony the orchestra be obviously on it mettle and it play most responsively and although there be plenty of vigor in the performance the ensemble be at it good when the play be soft and lyrical yet full of the suppress tension that be one of the hallmark of beethoven igor oistrakh will be the next soloist on feb 4 there be time when one suspect that the song that be drop from musical show before they reach broadway may really be good than many of those that be leave in
