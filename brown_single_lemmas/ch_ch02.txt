in most of the less develop country however such programing be at good inadequate and at bad nonexistent only a very few of the more advance one such a india and pakistan have develop systematic technique of programing other have so-called development plan but some of these be little more than list of project collect from various ministry while other be statement of goal without analysis of the action require to attain they only rarely be attention give to accurate progress report and evaluation we can help in the plan process neither growth nor a development program can be impose on a country it must express the nation s own will and goal nevertheless we can administer an aid program in such a manner a to promote the development of responsible programing first we can encourage responsibility by establish a condition for assistance on a substantial and sustain scale the definition of objective and the assessment of cost second we can make assistance for particular project conditional on the consistency of such project with the program third we can offer technical help in the formulation of program for development which be adapt to the country s objective and resource this include assistance in assemble the basic economic financial technological and educational information on which programing depend survey the need and requirement over time of broad sector of the economy such a transport agriculture communication industry and power design the financial mechanism of the economy in way that will promote growth without inflation and administrative practice which will make possible the more effective review and implementation of program once establish we must use common sense in apply condition the application of condition in the allocation of aid fund can not of course be mechanical it must be recognize that country at different stage of development have very different capability of meet such condition to insist on a level of performance in programing and budgeting completely beyond the capability of the recipient country would result in the frustration of the basic objective of we development assistance to encourage more rapid growth in the more primitive area where the capacity to absorb and utilize external assistance be limit some activity may be of such obvious priority that we may decide to support they before a well work out program be available thus we might provide limit assistance in such field a education essential transport communication and agricultural improvement despite the absence of acceptable country program in such a case however we would encourage the recipient country to get on with it programing task supply it with substantial technical assistance in perform that task and make it plain that an expansion or even a continuation of we assistance to the country s development be conditional upon programing progress be make at the other end of the spectrum where the more advance country can be rely upon to make well think through decision a to project priority within a consistent program we should be prepare to depart substantially from detail project approval a the basis for grant assistance and to move toward long-term support in cooperation with other develop country of the essential foreign exchange requirement of the country s development program d encourage self-help 1 the reason for stress self-help a systematic approach to development budgeting and programing be one important kind of self-help there be many other it be vitally important that the new we aid program should encourage all of they since the main thrust for development must come from the less develop country themselves external aid can only be marginal although the margin a in the case of the marshall plan can be decisive external aid can be effective only if it be a complement to self-help we aid therefore should increasingly be design to provide incentive for country to take the step that only they themselves can take aid advice be not interference in establish condition of self-help it be important that we not expect country to remake themselves in we image open society can take many form and within very broad limit recipient must be free to set they own goal and to devise they own institution to achieve those goal on the other hand it be no interference with sovereignty to point out defect where they exist such a that a plan call for factory without power to run they or for institution without train personnel to staff they once we have make clear that we be genuinely concern with a country s development potential we can be blunt in suggest the technical condition that must be meet for development to occur 2 the range of self-help the major area of self-help be the follow a the effective mobilize of resource this include not only development programing but also establish tax policy design to raise equitably resource for investment fiscal and monetary policy design to prevent serious inflation and regulatory policy aim to attract the financial and managerial resource of foreign investment and to prevent excessive luxury consumption by a few b the reduction of dependence on external source this include foresee balance-of-payment crisis with adequate attention to reduce dependence on import and adopt realistic exchange rate to encourage infant industry and spur export it also include provide for the train of national to operate project after they be complete c tap the energy of the entire population for both economic and political reason all segment of the population must be able to share in the growth of a country otherwise development will not lead to longrun stability d honesty in government in many society what we regard a corruption favoritism and personal influence be so accept a consistent with the more of officialdom and so integral a part of routine administrative practice that any attempt to force they elimination will be regard by the local leadership a not only unwarranted but unfriendly yet an economy can not get the most out of it resource if dishonesty corruption and favoritism be widespread moreover tolerance by we of such practice result in serious waste and diversion of aid resource and in the long run generate anti-american sentiment of a kind peculiarly damage to we political interest some of the most dramatic success of communism in win local support can be trace to the identification correct or not of communist regime with personal honesty and pro-western regime with corruption a requirement of reasonably honest administration may be politically uncomfortable in the short run but it be politically essential in the long run 3 we position on self-help the unite state can use it aid a an incentive to self-help by respond with aid on a sustain basis tailor to priority need to those country make serious effort in self-help in many instance it can withhold or limit it aid to country not yet will to make such effort there be other country where with skillful diplomacy we may be able by we aid to give encouragement to those group in government which would like to press forward with economic and social reform measure to promote growth government be rarely monolithic but there will be still other country where despite the inadequacy of the level of self-help we shall deem it wise for political or military reason to give substantial economic assistance even in these case we should promote self-help by make it clear that we support assistance be subject to reduction and ultimately to termination e encourage a long-term approach 1 development require a long-term approach the most fundamental concept of the new approach to economic aid be the focus of we attention we resource and we energy on the effort to promote the economic and social development of the less develop country this be not a short-run goal to have any success in this effort we must ourselves view it a an enterprise stretch over a considerable number of year and we must encourage the recipient of we aid to view it in the same fashion most of we aid will go to those near self-sufficiency how long it will take to show substantial success in this effort will vary greatly from country to country in several significant case such a india a decade of concentrate effort can launch these country into a stage in which they can carry forward they own economic and social progress with little or no government-to-government assistance these case in which light be already visible at the other end of the tunnel be one which over the next few year will absorb the bulk of we capital assistance gradually other will move up to the same level the number of country thus favorably situate be small but they people constitute over half of the population of the underdeveloped world meantime over the decade of the sixties we can hope that many other country will ready themselves for the big push into self-sustaining growth in still other which be barely on the threshold of the transition into modernity the decade can bring significant progress in launch the slow process of develop they human resource and they basic service to the point where an expand range of developmental activity be possible aid be a long-term process the whole program must be conceive of a an effort stretch over a considerable number of year to alter the basic social and economic condition in the less develop world it must be recognize a a slow-acting tool design to prevent political and military crisis such a those recently confront in laos and cuba it be not a tool for deal with these crisis after they have erupt 2 the specific reason for a long-term approach a the need to budget a period of year many of the individual project for which development assistance be require call for expenditure over lengthy period dam river development scheme transportation network educational system require year to construct moreover on complex project design work must be complete and order for machinery and equipment place month or even year before construction can commence thus a a development program be be launch commitment and obligation must be enter into in a give year which may exceed by twofold or threefold the expenditure to be make in that year the capital expansion program of business firm involve multi-year budgeting and the same be true of country development program b the need to plan investment program more importantly several of the more advance of the less develop country have find through experience that they must plan they own complex investment program for at least 5 year forward and tentatively for considerably more than that if they be to be sure that the various interdependent activity involve be all to take place in the proper sequence without such forward plan investment fund be waste because manufacture facility be complete before there be power to operate they or before there be transport to service they or a skilled labor force be train before there be plant available in which they can be employ c the need to allocate country resource most important of all the less develop country must be persuade to take the necessary step to allocate and commit they own resource they must be induce to establish the necessary tax fiscal monetary and regulatory policy they must be persuade to adopt the other necessary self-help measure which be describe in the precede section the take of these step involve tough internal policy decision moreover once these step be take they may require year to make themselves feel they must therefore be relate to long-range development plan 3 provide an incentive if the less develop country be to be persuade to adopt a long-term approach the unite state a the principal supplier of external aid must be prepare to give long-term commitment in this a in so many aspect of we development assistance activity the incentive effect of the posture we take be the most important one the extent to which we can persuade the less develop country to appraise they own resource to set target toward which they should be work to establish in the light of this forward perspective the most urgent priority for they immediate attention and to do the other thing which they must do to help themselves all on a realistic long-term basis will depend importantly on the incentive we place before they if they feel that we be take a long-term view of they problem and be prepare to enter into reasonably long-term association with they in they development activity they will be much more likely to undertake the difficult task require perhaps the most important incentive for they will be clear evidence that where other country have do this kind of home work we have respond with long-term commitment
