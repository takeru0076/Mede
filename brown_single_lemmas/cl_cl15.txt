 through a door conveniently unlock madden supplement that damn door say the police chief a gift horse to be view with suspicion madden s dark face wear a meditative look if there be collusion between an outside murderer and a member of the household it would be an elementary precaution to check on the door late and it make a very poor red herring for an inside job much good to break a cellar window do nt forget there be the hope it would pass for a natural death pauling remind he well with a house a big a that there must be at least one cellar window that would nt be notice right away unless there be a police investigation yeah and a pane of glass be nt hard to the telephone interrupt he he scoop up the receiver and say police chief into the mouthpiece and then oh yes mr benson i be hope i d hear from you today with he free hand he pull a pad and pencil toward he and begin to make note a he listen say uh-huh and i see at interval at last he say well thank you for call mr benson although there be no doubt in i mind and we ve be handle it a one i m glad to have it make official he hang up coroner he say to madden he s just hear from the pathologist who say mrs meek apparently die from suffocation pauling look at he note many minute hemorrhages in the lung particle of lint and thread in the mouth and nostril scraping from the bed linen identical with the lint and thread find in the nasal and oral cavity no other cause of death apparent trachea clear of mucus and foreign object brain examine for thrombosis clot or hemorrhage no sign of these no gross hemorrhage of lung heart brain or stomach he pause that s about it oh the time of death the duration of the digestive process vary the pathologist say but the empty stomach and the finding in the upper gastrointestinal tract indicate that mrs meek die several hour after she seven-oclock dinner probably around midnight give or take an hour either way pauling pause again so there it be he say not you problem of course unless johnston and the murderer be one and the same they discuss this possibility however likely it be pauling say he could nt limit himself to it he have to look for other prospect other motive until more conclusive evidence point to johnston come to light madden with he investigation center on the fraud say that tomorrow he would go to the bronx bank through which mrs meek s check to johnston have clear arthur william have to be locate they agree he might have be in collusion with johnston on the fraud he might be mrs meek s murderer or have play some part in she death this be madden s suggestion the police chief shake he head over it if arthur william be involve in the fraud or the murder then he too have another identity no one the medfield police have question profess to know any more about he than about johnston scholarship applicant pauling look doubtful madden explain that he be think of an application send directly to mrs meek then he ask to use the phone and call brian thayer who say that he be just leave to keep a lunch date but would be home by two oclock madden say that he would see he at two and make another call this one to mrs meek s lawyer mr hohlbein be out for the day but mr garth would be free at one-thirty the secretary s tone indicate that an appointment at such short notice be a concession for which madden should be duly grateful he infer that hohlbein and garth be high-priced lawyer he have lunch with pauling promptly at one-thirty he enter hohlbein and garth s elegant suite of office in medfield s new professional build he dislike garth on sight conservative clothe and haircut smile a shade too earnestly boyish for a man who must be well into he thirties handclasp too consciously quick and firm youngish man on the make madden label he and be ready to guess that in a correct not too push fashion the junior partner of the firm have political ambition that mrs garth would be impeccably suitable a the wife of a rise young lawyer that there be three child two boy and a girl that she be active in the woman s club and he in lion rotary and jaycee and finally that neither of they have harbored an unorthodox opinion since they wedding day madden know that he could be completely wrong about all this but also know that he would go right on dislike garth garth be prepare to be helpful in what he refer to with fastidious distaste a this unfortunate johnston affair which would not he say more than once have ever come about if mrs meek have only see fit to consult mr hohlbein or he about it madden regret not be able to find fault with so true a statement he ask to see a copy of mrs meek s will garth bring one out the date october 8 1957 immediately catch the inspector s eye fairly recent he remark be she in the habit of make new will oh no she have reason to change the one she make right after mr meek s death she estate have grow considerably she want to make a more equitable distribution of it among the group that would benefit the most particularly the scholarship fund at the time the will be draw mr hohlbein mention to i how mentally alert she seem for she age know just what change she want make and so forth garth hesitate mr hohlbein and i have notice some lapse since though most of they this past year i d say even two or three year ago i doubt that she d have become involve in this unfortunate johnston affair she d have consult we you see she always do before and show the utmost confidence in whatever we advise the inspector nod doubt this mrs meek have nt strike he a ready to seek anyone s advice least of all garth s with she sharp tongue she d have cut he pompousness to ribbon it would have be hohlbein who handle she affair madden settle back to read the will he skim over the millions that go to meek park medfield hospital the civic center the public health nurse association the library and so on pause when he come to the scholarship fund two millions be add to what have be set aside for it in mrs meek s lifetime and the proviso make that a long a brian thayer continue to discharge he duty a administrator of the fund to the satisfaction of the board of trustee hereinafter appoint by the bank administer the estate he be to be retain in he present capacity at a salary commensurate with the increase responsibility enlargement of the fund would entail a splendid vote of confidence in thayer madden reflect tenure too very nice for he he go on to personal bequest a list of name largely unknown to he twenty-five thousand to each of the great-niece in oregon not much to blood relative out of millions ten thousand to this friend and that five thousand to another to brian thayer the sum of ten thousand dollar to the peck ten thousand each to joan sheldon the conditional bequest of ten thousand to be pay to she in the event that she be still in mrs meek s employ at the time of the latter s death no additional five thousand for each year after joan s twenty-first birthday mrs meek have nt get around to take care of that too bad madden think joan sheldon have earn the large bequest mr hohlbein be leave twenty thousand garth ten there be no other name madden recognize arthur william s might well have be include he feel mrs meek have spend a small fortune on a search for he but have make no provision for he in she will if he should be find after she death and have never mention he name to she lawyer madden take up this point with garth who shrug it off old people have they idiosyncrasy this one come a bit high at thirty thousand or more well she have a number of they where money be concern garth say sometimes we d have trouble persuade she to make tax-exempt charitable contribution and i ve know she to quarrel with a plumber over a bill for fix a faucet the next moment she d put another half million into the scholarship fund or thirty thousand into something a impractical a this unfortunate johnston affair there be no tell how she d react to spend money madden inquire next about the audit of the scholarship fund there be an annual audit garth inform he no discrepancy or shortage have ever be find brian thayer be a thoroughly honest and competent administrator he salary have reach the ten thousand mark he expense run another four or five thousand the lawyer do nt know he very well although he see he occasionally at some dinner party thayer like himself madden reflect be the extra man so prize by hostess and find he easy enough to talk to but he do nt play golf do nt seem to belong to any local club he work take he away a lot of course which probably account for he tendency to keep to himself garth s glance begin to flicker to he watch he say that he have already tell the police chief that he do nt know what insurance man have recommend johnston to mrs meek he would offer no theory to account for she murder the whole thing he manner convey be so far outside the normal routine of hohlbein and garth that it practically demand be sweep under the rug no doubt mrs meek have snub he many a time and he feel no grief over she pass even so madden s dislike of the suave correct lawyer deepen it would be all right with he he decide if he investigation of the fraud with it probable by-product of murder lead to garth s door motive ten-thousand-dollar bequest at first glance not much of a motive for a man of he stand but for all he air of affluence who could tell what he private financial picture be the inspector know a he leave that this be wishful think nevertheless he make a mental note to look into garth s financial background brian thayer have a downtown address he live in an apartment house not over three or four year old a reclaim island of landscape brick and glass on the fringe of the business district he occupy a two-bedroom apartment on the fourth floor use the second bedroom a he office airy and bright the apartment be furnish with good modern furniture rug and drapery do by a professional decorator madden think and somehow a impersonal a unremarkable a it occupant in dunston the rent would run close to two hundred a month in medfield perhaps twenty-five less not all of it pay by thayer who could charge off one room on he expense account he take madden into the room he use a an office it contain a desk file a typewriter on a stand and two big leather armchair a newspaper open at stock-market report lie on one of they thayer fold it up and offer a drink the inspector decline to begin the interview he ask if thayer with more time to think it over could add to what he have say the other day about johnston thayer shake he head it s all i think about too that and she death it s still unbelievable that it be murder for all she domineer way i can nt conceive of she have have a deadly enemy
