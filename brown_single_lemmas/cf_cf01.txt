in american romance almost nothing rate high than what the movie man have call meet cute that be boy-meets-girl seem more adorable if it do nt take place in an atmosphere of correct and acute boredom just about the most enthral real-life example of meet cute be the charles macarthur-helen hayes saga reputedly all he do be give she a handful of peanut but he say simultaneously i wish they be emerald aside from the comico-romantico content here a good linguist-anthropologist could readily pick up a few other fact especially if he have a little more of the conversation to go on the way macarthur say he line if you have the record transcript of a professional linguist would probably have go like this afj primary stress on emerald and wish note pitch 3 pretty high on emerald but with a slight degree of drawl one degree of oversoftness conclusion the people involve and subsequent fact bear i out here know clearly the relative value of peanut and emerald both monetary and sentimental and the drawl oversoft voice of flirtation though fairly overt be still well within the prescribe gambit of they culture in other word like automation machine design to work in tandem they share the same program a mutual understand not only of english word but of the four stress pitch and juncture that can change they mean from black to white at this point unfortunately romance become a regrettably small part of the picture but consider if you can bear it what might have happen if macarthur for some perverse undaunted reason have make the same remark to an eskimo girl in eskimo to she peanut and emerald would have be just so much blubber the point quite simply be this word they might have have but communication no this basic principle the first in a richly knot bundle be convey to i by dr henry lee smith jr at the university of buffalo where he head the world s first department of anthropology and linguistics a brisk amuse man apparently construct on an ingenious system of spring-joints attune to the same peppery rhythm a he mind smith begin he academic career teach speech to barnard girl a project considerably enliven by he devotion to a record about a young rat name arthur who never could make up he mind late he become one of the central spirit of the army language program and the language school of washington s foreign service institute it be there in the course of try to prepare new man for the culture shock they might encounter in remote overseas post that he first begin to develop a system of chart the norm of human communication to the train ear of the linguist talk have always reveal a stagger quantity of information about the talker such thing a geographical origin and history socio-economic identity education it be only fairly recently however that linguist have develop a systematic way of chart voice on paper in a way that tell even more about the speaker and about the success or failure of human communication between two people this for obvious reason make they technique superbly useful in study the psychiatric interview so useful in fact that they have be successfully use to suggest way to speed diagnosis and to evaluate the progress of therapy in the early 1950 s smith together with he distinguish colleague george trager so austerely academic he sometimes fight he own evident charm and a third man with the engage name of birdwhistell ray agree on some basic premise about the three-part process that make communication 1 word or language 2 paralanguage a set of phenomenon include laugh weep voice break and tone of voice and 3 kinesic the technical name for gesture facial expression and body shift nod or shake the head talk with one s hand et cetera smith s first workout with stress pitch and juncture be base on mother which spell in we culture a good deal more than bread alone for example if you be a reasonably well-adjusted person there be certain way that be reasonable and appropriate for address you mother the usual we norm would be afj middle pitch slight pause juncture before mother slight rise at the end the symbol of mother s status here be all usual for culture usa quite other feeling be evidence by this style afj note the drop to pitch 1 the low on mother with no rise at the end of the sentence this be a fade end and what you have here be a downtalking style of speech express something less than conventional respect for mother even less regard for mom and mom s apple pie go with afj in other word the way the speaker relate to mother be clearly indicate and while the mean of the word be not in this instance alter the quality of communication in both the second and third example be definitely impair an accompany record of paralanguage factor for the second example might also note a throaty rasp with this seven-word sentence though the speaker undoubtedly think he be deal only with the subject of food he be tell thing about himself and in the last two example reveal that he have depart from the custom of he culture the joint investigation of linguistics and psychiatry have establish in point of fact that no matter what the subject of conversation be or what word be involve it be impossible for people to talk at all without tell over and over again what sort of people they be and how they relate to the rest of the world since interview be the basic therapeutic and diagnostic instrument of modern psychiatry the record of interview for playback and study have be a boost of redstone proportion in new research and train some of the early recording make in the 1940 s demonstrate that psychiatrist react immediately to anger and anxiety in the sound track whereas write record of the same interview offer far fewer cue to therapy which if they be at all discernible in print be pick up only by the most skilled and sensitive expert in a general way psychiatrist be able to establish on a wide basis what many of they have always feel that the most tell cue in psychotherapy be acoustic that such thing a stress and nag be transmit by sound alone and not necessarily by word at a minimum record usually on tape which be now in wide professional use bring the psychiatric interview alive so that the full range of emotion and mean can be explore repeatedly by the therapist or by a battery of therapist new to this high-power battery be the expert in linguistics who have carry that minimum to a new level by add a systematic analysis with symbol to the type transcript of interview they have supply a new set of technique for the therapist linguistic chart of the transcribe interview flag point where the patient s voice depart from expect norm it flag such possible breakdown of communication a rehearse dialogue the note of disapproval ambivalence or ambiguity annoyance resentment and the disinclination to speak at all this last often mark by a fade-in begin of sentence interpretation naturally remain the role of the therapist but orientation not only the patient s vocal giveaway of geographical and socio-economic background but also vocal but non-verbal giveaway of danger spot in he relationship to people can be considerably beef up by the linguist he esoteric chartings of the voice alert the therapist to area where deep probe may bring to light underlie psychological difficulty make they apparent first to the therapist and eventually to the patient in one now-historic first interview for example the transcript reproduce from the book the first five minute go like this the therapist s level tone be bland and neutral he have for example avoid stress you which would imply disapproval or surprise which would set the patient apart from other people the patient on the other hand be far from neutral aside from she specifically regional accent she reveal by the use of the triad irritable tense depress a certain pedantic itemization that indicate she have some familiarity with literary or scientific language ie she must have have at least a high-school education and she be tell a story she have mentally rehearse some time before then she catapult into everything and everybody put particular violence on everybody indicate to the linguist that this be a spot to flag that be it be not congruent to the patient s general style of speech up to this point consequently it be refer to the therapist for attention he may then very well conclude that everybody be probably not the true target of she resentment immediately thereafter the patient fracture she rehearse story veer into an oversoft breathy sloppily articulate i do nt feel like talk right now within the first five minute of this interview it be apparent to the therapist that everybody truthfully refer to the woman s husband she say late but still within the open five minute i keep think of a divorce but that s another emotional death the linguistic and paralinguistic signal of misery be all present in the voice chart for this sentence so be certain signal that she do not accept divorce by say another emotional death she reveal that there have be a previous one although she have not describe it in word this the therapist may pursue in late question the phrase emotional death interest and to a non-scientific mind rather touch suggest that this woman may have some flair for word perhaps even something of the temperament regrettably call creative since the psychiatric interview like any other interview depend on communication it be significant to note that the therapist in this interview be a man of mark skill and long experience he own communication apparatus operate superbly and lillian ross reader will note instantly it total lack of resemblance to the blunt monumentally unmeshed mechanism of dr blauberman interestingly enough although none of the real-life therapist involve could conceivably compare with blauberman when group of they begin play back interview they discover any number of way in which they want to polish they own interview technique almost everyone on first hear one of he own session on tape express some desire to take the whole thing over again yet in spite of this intensive study of the tape interview by team of psychotherapist and linguist lay bare the surprise fact that in the first five minute of an initial interview the patient often reveal a many a a dozen time just what s wrong with he to spot these giveaway the therapist must know either intuitively or scientifically how to listen naturally the patient do not say i hate i father or sibling rivalry be what bug i what he do do be give himself away by communicate information over and above the word involve some of the classic indicator a describe by drs pittenger hockett and danehy in the first five minute be these ambiguity of pronoun stammer or repetition of i you he she et cetera may signal ambiguity or uncertainty on the other hand significant fact may be conceal she may mean i or everybody a it do with the tense and irritable woman mention before may refer to a specific person the word that be not use can be a important a the word that be use therapist and linguist must always consider the alternative when someone say for example they take x-ray to see that there be nothing wrong with i it pay to consider how this statement would normally be make this patient in actuality be a neurasthenic who have almost come to the point of accept the fact that it be not she soma but she psyche that be the cause of she difficulty amateur linguist note here that pursewarden in durrell s alexandria quartet stammer when he speak of he wife which be hardly surprise in view of they disastrous relationship
