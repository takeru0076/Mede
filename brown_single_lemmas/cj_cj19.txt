7-1 example of binomial experiment some experiment be compose of repetition of independent trial each with two possible outcome the binomial probability distribution may describe the variation that occur from one set of trial of such a binomial experiment to another we devote a chapter to the binomial distribution not only because it be a mathematical model for an enormous variety of real life phenomenon but also because it have important property that recur in many other probability model we begin with a few example of binomial experiment marksmanship example a train marksman shoot five round at a target all under practically the same condition may hit the bulls-eye from 0 to 5 time in repeat set of five shot he number of bulls-eyes vary what can we say of the probability of the different possible number of bulls-eyes inheritance in mouse in litter of eight mouse from similar parent the number of mouse with straight instead of wavy hair be an integer from 0 to 8 what probability should be attach to these possible outcome ace one with three dice when three dice be toss repeatedly what be the probability that the number of ace be 0 or 1 or 2 or 3 general binomial problem more generally suppose that an experiment consist of a number of independent trial that each trial result in either a success or a non-success failure and that the probability of success remain constant from trial to trial in the example above the occurrence of a bulls-eye a straight-haired mouse or an ace could be call a success in general any outcome we choose may be label success the major question in this chapter be what be the probability of exactly x success in n trial in chapter 3 and 4 we answer question like those in the example usually by count point in a sample space fortunately a general formula of wide applicability solve all problem of this kind before derive this formula we explain what we mean by problem of this kind experiment be often compose of several identical trial and sometimes experiment themselves be repeat in the marksmanship example a trial consist of one round shoot at a target with outcome either one bulls-eye success or none failure far an experiment might consist of five round and several set of five round might be regard a a super-experiment compose of several repetition of the five-round experiment if three dice be toss a trial be one toss of one die and the experiment be compose of three trial or what amount to the same thing if one die be toss three time each toss be a trial and the three toss form the experiment mathematically we shall not distinguish the experiment of three dice toss once from that of one die toss three time these example be illustrative of the use of the word trial and experiment a they be use in this chapter but they be quite flexible word and it be well not to restrict they too narrowly example 1 student football manager ten student act a manager for a high-school football team and of these manager a proportion p be license driver each friday one manager be choose by lot to stay late and load the equipment on a truck on three friday the coach have need a driver consider only these friday what be the probability that the coach have driver all 3 time exactly 2 time 1 time 0 time discussion note that there be 3 trial of interest each trial consist of choose a student manager at random the 2 possible outcome on each trial be driver or nondriver since the choice be by lot each week the outcome of different trial be independent the manager stay the same so that afj be the same for all week we now generalize these idea for general binomial experiment for an experiment to qualify a a binomial experiment it must have four property 1 there must be a fix number of trial 2 each trial must result in a success or a failure a binomial trial 3 all trial must have identical probability of success 4 the trial must be independent of each other below we use we early example to describe and illustrate these four property we also give for each property an example where the property be absent the language and notation introduce be standard throughout the chapter 1 there must be a fix number n of repeat trial for the marksman we study set of five shot afj for the mouse we restrict attention to litter of eight afj and for the ace we toss three dice afj experiment without a fix number of trial toss a die until an ace appear here the number of trial be a random variable not a fix number 2 binomial trial each of the n trial be either a success or a failure success and failure be just convenient label for the two category of outcome when we talk about binomial trial in general these word be more expressive than label like a and not-a it be natural from the marksman s viewpoint to call a bulls-eye a success but in the mouse example it be arbitrary which category correspond to straight hair in a mouse the word binomial mean of two name or of two term and both usage apply in we work the first to the name of the two outcome of a binomial trial and the second to the term p and afj that represent the probability of success and failure sometimes when there be many outcome for a single trial we group these outcome into two class a in the example of the die where we have arbitrarily construct the class ace and not-ace experiment without the two-class property we classify mouse a straight-haired or wavy-haired but a hairless mouse appear we can escape from such a difficulty by rule out the animal a not constitute a trial but such a solution be not always satisfactory 3 all trial have identical probability of success each die have probability afj of produce an ace the marksman have some probability p perhaps 01 of make a bulls-eye note that we need not know the value of p for the experiment to be binomial experiment where p be not constant during a round of target practice the sun come from behind a cloud and dazzle the marksman lower he chance of a bulls-eye 4 the trial be independent strictly speak this mean that the probability for each possible outcome of the experiment can be compute by multiply together the probability of the possible outcome of the single binomial trial thus in the three-dice example afj afj and the independence assumption imply that the probability that the three dice fall ace not-ace ace in that order be afj experimentally we expect independence when the trial have nothing to do with one another example where independence fail a family of five plan to go together either to the beach or to the mountain and a coin be toss to decide we want to know the number of people go to the mountain when this experiment be view a compose of five binomial trial one for each member of the family the outcome of the trial be obviously not independent indeed the experiment be good view a consist of one binomial trial for the entire family the follow be a less extreme example of dependence consider couple visit an art museum each person vote for one of a pair of picture to receive a popular prize vote for one picture may be call success for the other failure an experiment consist of the vote of one couple or two trial in repetition of the experiment from couple to couple the vote of the two person in a couple probably agree more often than independence would imply because couple who visit the museum together be more likely to have similar taste than be a random pair of people draw from the entire population of visitor table 7-1 illustrate the point the table show that 06 of the boy and 06 of the girl vote for picture a therefore under independent vote afj or 036 of the couple would cast two vote for picture a and afj or 016 would cast two vote for picture b thus in independent vote afj or 052 of the couple would agree but table 7-1 show that afj or 070 agree too many for independent vote each performance of an n-trial binomial experiment result in some whole number from 0 through n a the value of the random variable x where afj we want to study the probability function of this random variable for example we be interest in the number of bulls-eyes not which shot be bulls-eyes a binomial experiment can produce random variable other than the number of success for example the marksman get 5 shot but we take he score to be the number of shot before he first bulls-eye that be 0 1 2 3 4 or 5 if he get no bulls-eye thus we do not score the number of bulls-eyes and the random variable be not the number of success the constancy of p and the independence be the condition most likely to give trouble in practice obviously very slight change in p do not change the probability much and a slight lack of independence may not make an appreciable difference for instance see example 2 of section 5-5 on red card in hand of 5 on the other hand even when the binomial model do not describe well the physical phenomenon be study the binomial model may still be use a a baseline for comparative purpose that be we may discuss the phenomenon in term of it departure from the binomial model to summarize a binomial experiment consist of afj independent binomial trial all with the same probability afj of yield a success the outcome of the experiment be x success the random variable x take the value afj with probability afj or more briefly afj we shall find a formula for the probability of exactly x success for give value of p and n when each number of success x be pair with it probability of occurrence afj the set of pair afj be a probability function call a binomial distribution the choice of p and n determine the binomial distribution uniquely and different choice always produce different distribution except when afj then the number of success be always 0 the set of all binomial distribution be call the family of binomial distribution but in general discussion this expression be often shorten to the binomial distribution or even the binomial when the context be clear binomial distribution be treat by jame bernoulli about 1700 and for this reason binomial trial be sometimes call bernoulli trial random variable each binomial trial of a binomial experiment produce either 0 or 1 success therefore each binomial trial can be think of a produce a value of a random variable associate with that trial and take the value 0 and 1 with probability q and p respectively the several trial of a binomial experiment produce a new random variable x the total number of success which be just the sum of the random variable associate with the single trial example 2 the marksman get two bulls-eyes one on he third shoot and one on he fifth the number of success on the five individual shot be then 0 0 1 0 1 the number of success on each shoot be a value of a random variable that have value 0 or 1 and there be 5 such random variable here they sum be x the total number of success which in this experiment have the value afj
