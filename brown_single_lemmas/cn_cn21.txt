sulphur oil and copra make the kind of tinder any firebug dream of i suppose a lascar sailor have sneak a cigarette in the hold and touch off the blaze now roar up in great oily cloud of smoke and flame the fierce heat quickly drive we to the stern where we huddle like suffocate sheep not know what to do the lifeboat be stick fast we could nt budge they i hear a cry from a stoker a a pillar of flame leap from a hatch and tongue the man s bare back he sprint to the rail and leap overboard into the shark-infested water one especially bad detonation shake lifeboat no 3 which tremble violently in the davit brassnose yell come on sommers max step on it we get a chance now heave on those rope the boat s come unstuck we pull and swear and yank and weep scrape we hand until they bleed profusely the bonaventure be quiver and lurch like an old spavined mare she stern be down and a sharp list help we to cut loose the lifeboat which drop heavily into the water brassnose max and i leap into the sea and swim to the boat let s get away fast say brassnose shake water from he mop of bleach hair that tub be go to explode all at once then the bonaventure seem to disintegrate with a roar of live steam geyser of spark and flame and a dense cloud of black-and-orange smoke dimly we hear the voice of man in mortal agony but we could nt go back into that inferno already we leaky lifeboat be fill with five inch of water sommers you bale while we row brassnose command a good a i could determine we be some 700 mile west of new guinea in the bismark archipelago three day previously we have steam past barren rennell island in the distance now we peer anxiously for any speck of land in the pacific for this interminable bail would have to stop soon there be gigantic blister and rope burn on we hand we muscle be hot wire of pain brassnose be strangely silent the big man with the whiten hair murmur something he word sound a if they be in the manu tongue which i recognize have study the dialect in i anthropology 6 class at the university of chicago he then say something which strike a chord in i memory god help we if we re near the island of eromonga we d be in real trouble then i d rather keep bail or sink i be puzzle by the remark then i recall the voice of mild professor howard griggs three year ago in a university lecture on primitive society he have be speak of this archipelago even when the island be under german mandate before world war 1 european give eromonga a wide berth the place be inhabit by several hundred warlike woman who be anachronism of the twentieth century stone age amazon who live in an all-female matriarchal society which be self-sufficient i remember too the jest voice of a classmate bobby pauson but how do they reproduce dr griggs i m sure that male have something to do with that process there have be classroom guffaw which quickly subside a professor griggs say dryly i see you point pauson of course male play a role there but believe i when i say you would nt enjoy yourself one bit on eromonga indeed you would nt live long for the female either drive the man they ve seize from neighboring island back to they boat after exploit they for amatory purpose or they destroy they by revolt but ingenious method in fact one important aspect of they very religion be the annihilation of man i think i know what you mean brassnose i say i know something about eromonga let s hope we come to a safe place but we do nt three hour late while we be bail desperately a dot of land come into view foster lukuklu frayne make a sign over he heart with he two link thumb i recognize it a an ancient manu gesture intend to propitiate the devil a half-hour pass we have drift close in a voice so frighten a to seem not he own the big bosun mate quaver tchalo it be eromonga look hard you can see with you naked eye the wooden scaffolding on the cliff i squint at the loom shoreline there be a wooden tower or derrick there something like a ski jump it be perhaps 80 foot high and have be artfully construct of log a fine example of engineering in a primitive society what be the scaffolding for brassnose he make a sound of despair deep in he throat it be embarrass to see strap blonde brassnose comport himself like a child who talk about bogeyman aaa-ee it be they tultul the jump platform of death it be the last of the three test of manhood which the woman impose to discover if a male be worthy of survival there often i hear i uncle and cousin speak of it when i be a small boy grow up in rabaul they have never see a tultul but they have hear about it from they father we lifeboat be fill rapidly and despite what i have hear of the inhabitant of eromonga i be glad to see a long and graceful outrigger man by three bronzed girl glide out of a lagoon into the open sea and toward we craft i expect brassnose a a man with a strain of melanesian in he blood to speak to they but he have turn a sickly green and appear tongue-tied or panicked so i muster i few word of the manu dialect and say we greet you in peace in ngandlu i friend and i come from a ship which be destroy by fire we be thirsty and hungry we sore and burn hand and arm need attention the girl in the prow of the outrigger turn a smile like a beacon on i i note that she full breast be bare and that she wear a garland of red pandanus fruit in she blue-black hair she say i name be songau and these girl be ponkob and piwen you be welcome to eromonga i people await you on the shore you shall have food water and rest thirty minute late the outrigger grate on sand and other girl wait on shore rush forward to pull it up on the beach and make it fast with vine rope to a large boulder i see a dozen or so other outrigger moor there i look all i rosy vision of rest and even pleasure on this island vanish at the sight there be a mound of bleach human bone and skull at the base of the big wooden derrick some have be there for year other still have whiten shred of decay flesh stick to they there be one object which sicken yet fascinate i this be also a corpse a male judge from the coral arm band the tribal scar still discernible on the maggoty face the paint bone of the warrior caste which still pierce the septum of the rot nose the body may have be two or three week dead i look with revulsion at the leg they be shatter many small bone protrude crazily from the shred of flesh the man must have leap to he death from the topmost ring of the tultul a if divine i thought the girl songau smile warmly and say in the casual tone an american woman might use in describe she rise garden this be we tultul a jump platform aku late you shall know it good be it not well-made we old one blow down in a storm at the time of the pokeneu festival fifteen moon ago it take thirty of we woman almost six moon to build this one which be high and strong than the old one we be very proud of it you have every right to be i reply gravely in the manu dialect but i attention be fix on brassnose the big and strong of we he look a if he be go to keel over i feel a queasiness in i own stomach but it would nt do to show these girl that we be afraid not so soon anyway i clap the big man with the bleach hair on he shoulder and say heartily hope it would make an impression on the woman this one be the maku frayne he speak you language too for he be the grandson of a chieftain on taui who make much magic and be strong and cunning the maku frayne have inherit this strength from he grandfather this be the bad thing i could have say brassnose turn a stricken face toward i and say brokenly sommers you meddle yank you re a fool they despise male who brag of they strength they destroy such man with they damn test you ve ruine i blast you at first i think he be out of he head talk wildly like this but a glance at songau and the other woman confirm what brassnose have blurt out the woman s face have harden after i statement at a nod from songau four lithe and muscular girl dart to frayne s side and seize he by the arm the man be an ox and he put up a creditable struggle but four eromonga woman be more than a match for the strong male that ever live besides terror have sap some of frayne s vitality and will i last impression a they lead he off to a stockade be of he pale face in the manu tongue eromonga mean manhood a quality which the woman derisively toast in weekly feast at which great quantity of a brew like kava be imbibe in the hut to which i be assign max have he own quarter i food be bring to i by a wrinkle crone with bare droop breast who seem to enjoy converse with i in rudimentary phrase she name be lturu and she tell i many thing for an anthropologist loquacious old lturu be a i of information though i have a great dread of the island and feel i would never leave it alive i eagerly write down everything she tell i about it woman she account be late confirm by the scobee-frazier expedition from the university of manitoba in 1951 from lturu i hear that until about 1850 the people of this island which be about the size of guam or small have be of both sex and that the normal family life of melanesian tribe be observe here with minor variation but in the middle of the last century an island woman name karipo seize a spear in the heat of an inter-tribal battle and rally the woman after they man have flee miraculously karipo and she woman have succeed in drive a hundred invader from the isle of pamasu back to they war canoe after considerable loss of life on both side karipo be something of a politician a well a a militarist she quickly exploit the exalt position she now occupy by harass the disorganize male and even put many of they to death within a decade or less few man be leave and a feminist society have spring up karipo be great goddess tell we mother that man be not necessary except to father child the crone tell i all man go away from here those who stay have to pass test few pass she cackle with mirth show the stump of betel-stained tooth karipo s woman then name this place eromonga manhood for just the strong man could stay here come i show you the old woman arise stiffly and lead i to a clear where a small hut stand in the shade of a palm tree in front of the squalid dwelling i see four figure in a semi-circle on the ground
