introduction muscle weakness be now recognize a an uncommon though serious complication of steroid therapy with most of the synthetic adrenal corticosteroid in clinical use although biopsy have show structural change in some of the report case of steroid-induced weakness this case provide the only example know to we in which necropsy afford the opportunity for extensive study of multiple muscle group the case describe in this paper be that of an old man who develop disable muscular weakness while receive a variety of steroid for a refractory anemia report of case this patient be a 65-year-old white male accountant who enter the new york hospital for he fourth and terminal admission on june 26 1959 because of disable weakness and general debility in 1953 the patient develop an unexplained anemia for which 15 blood transfusion be give over a period of 4 year splenomegaly be first note in 1956 and a sternal marrow biopsy at that time show scatter focus of fibrosis suggestive of myelofibrosis no additional transfusion be necessary after the institution of prednisone in july 1957 in an initial dose of 40 mg daily with gradual taper to 10 mg daily this medication be continue until february 1958 in february 1958 the patient suffer a myocardial infarction complicate by pulmonary edema additional finding at this time include cardiomegaly peripheral arteriosclerosis obliterans and cholelithiasis the hemoglobin be 116 gm therapy include digitalization and anticoagulation late chlorothiazide and salt restriction become necessary to control the edema of chronic congestive failure because of increase anemia triamcinolone 8 mg daily be start on feb 23 1958 and be continue until july 1958 in september 1958 the patient develop generalize weakness and fatigue which be concurrent with exacerbation of he anemia the hemoglobin be 106 gm in an attempt to reverse the downhill trend by stimulate the bone marrow and control any hemolytic component triamcinolone 16 mg daily be begin on sept 26 1958 and continue until feb 18 1959 at first the patient feel strong and the hemoglobin rise to 138 gm but on oct 20 1958 he complain of cave in in he knee by nov 8 1958 weakness specifically involve the pelvic and thigh musculature be pronounce and a common complaint be difficulty in step up on to curb prednisone 30 mg daily be substitute for triamcinolone from nov 22 until dec 1 1958 without any improvement in the weakness serum potassium at this time be 38 meq per liter and the hemoglobin be 139 gm by dec 1 1958 the weakness in the pelvic and quadriceps muscle group be appreciably bad and it become difficult for the patient to rise unaided from a sit or recline position triamcinolone 16 mg daily be resume and maintain until feb 18 1959 chlorothiazide be omit for a 2-week period but there be no change in the muscle weakness at this time a detail neuromuscular examination reveal diffuse muscle atrophy that be moderate in the hand and foot but mark in the shoulder hip and pelvic girdle with hypoactive deep-tendon reflex no fasciculations or sensory defect be find electromyography reveal no evidence of low motor neuron disease thyroid function test yield normal result the protein-bound iodine be 66 mg and the radioactive iodine uptake over the thyroid gland be 46 % in 24 hour with a conversion ratio of 12 % a schilling test demonstrate normal absorption of vitamin afj in february 1959 during the second admission to the new york hospital a biopsy specimen of the leave gastrocnemius show strike increase in the sarcolemmal sheath nucleus and shrunken muscle fibers in several section serial serum potassium level remain normal the serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase be 10 unit per ml per min the clinical impression at this time be either muscular dystrophy or polymyositis on feb 12 1959 purify corticotropin acth gel 20 unit daily intramuscularly be start but have to be discontinue 3 week late because of excessive fluid retention from march 3 to may 1 1949 the patient be maintain on dexamethasone 3 to 6 mg daily in may 1959 prednisone 30 mg daily replace the dexamethasone muscle weakness do not improve and the patient need first a cane then crutch in spite of normal thyroid function test a trial of propylthiouracil 400 mg daily for one week be give but serve only to intensify muscle weakness repeat attempt to withdraw steroid entirely be unsuccessful because increase muscle weakness result a well a fever malaise anorexia anxiety and an exacerbation of the anemia these reaction be interpret a be manifestation of hypoadrenocorticism severe back pain in june 1959 prompt a third hospital admission extensive osteoporosis with partial collapse of d8 be find a high-protein diet calcium lactate supplement and norethandrolone fail to change the skeletal complaint or the severe muscle weakness the terminal hospital admission on june 27 1959 be necessitate by continue weakness and debility complicate by urinary retention and painful thrombosed hemorrhoids x-ray film of the vertebral column show progression of the demineralization on july 4 1959 the patient develop mark abdominal pain and distension go into shock and die finding at necropsy the body be that of a well-developed somewhat debilitate white man weigh 108 lb there be bilateral pterygia and arcus senilis and the mouth be edentulous the heart weigh 510 gm and at the outflow tract the leave and right ventricle measure 19 and 3 mm respectively the coronary artery be sclerotic and diffusely narrow throughout they course and the right coronary artery be virtually occlude by a yellow atheromatous plaque 15 cm distal to it origin the myocardium of the posterior base of the leave ventricle be replace by gray scar tissue over a 75 cm area the valve be normal except for thin yellow plaque on the inferior surface of the mitral leaflet microscopically section from the posterior base of the leave ventricle of the heart show several large area of replacement of muscle by fibrous tissue in addition other section contain focal area of recent myocardial necrosis that be infiltrate with neutrophil many of the myocardial fibers be hypertrophied and have large irregular basophilic nucleus the intima of the large coronary artery be thicken by fibrous tissue contain fusiform cleft and mononuclear cell the intimal surface of the aorta be cover with confluent yellow-brown hard friable plaque along it entire course and there be a mark narrow of the orifice of the large major visceral artery in particular the orifice of the right renal and celiac artery be virtually occlude and both calcify common iliac artery be completely occlude the lung weigh together 950 gm on the surface of both lung there be emphysematous bleb measure up to 3 cm in diameter the parenchyma be slightly hyperemic in the apex of the leave lung and there be several firm gray fibrocalcific nodule measure a large a 3 mm microscopically there be emphysema fibrosis and vascular congestion macrophage load with brown pigment be see in some of the alveoli and the intima of some of the small artery be thicken by fibrous tissue the firm red spleen weigh 410 gm and it surface be mottled by discrete small patch of white material the endothelial cell line the sinusoid be prominent and many contain large quantity of hemosiderin some of the sinusoid contain large number of nucleat red cell and cell of the granulocytic series be find in small number there be slight fibrosis and mark arteriolosclerosis the liver weigh 2090 gm be brown in color and the cut surface be mottled by irregular pale area microscopically there be hyperemia of the central vein and there be some atrophy of adjacent parenchyma some liver cord cell contain vacuolated cytoplasm while other have small amount of brown hemosiderin pigment the gallbladder contain about 40 cc of green-brown bile and 3 smooth dark-green calculi measure up to 1 cm in diameter the mucosa of the stomach be atrophic and irregularly blacken over a 14 cm area the small and large intestine be fill with gas and the jejunum be dilate to about 2 time it normal circumference the small intestine and colon contain approximately 300 cc of foul-smelling sanguineous material and the mucosa throughout be hyperemic and mottled green-brown a careful search fail to show occlusion of any of the mesenteric vessel microscopically the mucosa of the stomach show extensive cytolysis and contain large number of gram-negative bacterial rod the submucosa be focally infiltrate with neutrophil the mucosa of the jejunum and ileum show similar change and in some area the submucosa be edematous and contain considerable number of neutrophil some of the small vessel be fill with fibrin thrombi and there be extensive interstitial hemorrhage a section of the colon reveal intense hyperemia and extensive focal ulceration of the mucosa associate with much fibrin and many neutrophil culture take from the jejunum yield monilia albicans pseudomonas pyocanea aerobacter aerogenes and streptococcus anhemolyticus the kidney be pale and weigh right 110 gm and leave 230 gm the surface be coarsely and finely granular and punctuate by clear fluid-filled cyst measure up to 3 cm in diameter on the surface of the right kidney there be also 2 yellow firm friable raise area measure up to 2 cm in diameter microscopically both kidney show many small cortical scar in which there be glomerular and interstitial fibrosis tubular atrophy and an infiltration of lymphocyte and plasma cell occasional tubule contain hyaline cast admix with neutrophil throughout there be mark arteriolosclerosis and hyalinization of afferent glomerular arterioles these change be more mark in the atrophic right kidney than in the leave in addition there be 2 small papillary adenoma in the right kidney the bone of the vertebral body rib and sternum be soft and be easily compress the marrow of the vertebral body be pale and show area of fatty replacement microscopically there be many area of hypercellularity alternate with area of hypocellularity the cell of the erythroid myeloid and megakaryocytic series be normal except for they number there be no evidence of fibrosis the muscle of the extremity chest wall neck and abdominal wall be soft pale and atrophic microscopic study of the gastrocnemius pectoralis major transversus abdominis bicep brachii and diaphragm show atrophy a well a vary degree of injury range from swell and vacuolization to focal necrosis of the muscle fibers these change be most mark in the gastrocnemius and bicep and less evident in the pectoralis diaphragm and transversus in the gastrocnemius and bicep there be many swell and homogeneous necrotic fibers such a that show in figure 2 such swell fibers be deeply eosinophilic contain a few pyknotic nucleus and show loss of cross-striations obliteration of myofibrils and prominent vacuolization the necrosis often involve only a portion of the length of a give fiber and usually the immediately adjacent fibers be normal a show in figure 3 the protoplasm of other fibers be pale granular or flocculate and invade by phagocytes inflammatory cell be strikingly absent in association with these change in the fibers there be strike alteration in the muscle nucleus these be increase both in number and in size contain prominent nucleoli and be distribute throughout the fiber fig 2 - 5 in contrast to the nuclear change describe above another change in muscle nucleus be see usually occur in fibers that be somewhat small than normal but that show distinct cross-striations and myofibrillae the nucleus of these fibers a be show in figure 3 and 4 show remarkable proliferation and be closely approximate form a chainlike structure at either the center or the periphery of the fiber individual nucleus be usually oval to round though occasionally elongate and frequently small and somewhat pyknotic at time clump of 10 to 15 closely-packed nucleus be also observe occasionally there be small basophilic fibers that be devoid of myofibrillae and contain many vesicular nucleus with prominent nucleoli fig 5 these be think to represent regenerate fibers trichrome stain fail to show fibrosis in the involve muscle in all of the section examine the arterioles and small artery be essentially normal
