he remember every detail of he pre-assault movement but nothing of the final desperate rush to come to grip with the enemy when the victory cheer go up this officer find himself still mount with he horse press broadside against cleburne s log parapet in a tangle group of infantryman he hat be go the tear be stream from he eye he never know how he get there six climactic minute in an individual s life leave no memory eight hundred and sixty-five rebel surrender within they work and a thousand more be capture or surrender themselves that night and the next day eight field gun be capture in position seven battle flag and fourteen officer sword be send to thoma headquarters it be the only sizable assault upon infantry and artillery behind breastworks successfully make by either side

to advance with they regiment the thirty-eighth regiment of ohio volunteer one of the regiment in thoma first division during buell s command suffer it great loss of the war in this action a popular belief grow up after the war that the only time during the civil war that thoma ever put he horse to a gallop be when he go to hurry up stanley for this assault sherman be responsible for the story when he say in he memoir that this be the only time he could recall see thoma ride so fast while thoma injure back lead he to restrain he mount from it most violent gait he move quickly enough when he have to it be not in the record but he must have gallop he horse at peach tree creek when he bring up ward s gun to save newton s crumble line while the final combat of the campaign be be work out at jonesborough thoma on sherman s instruction order slocum now command the twentieth corps to make an effort to occupy atlanta if he could do so without expose he bridgehead to a counterattack the dispatch must have be send after sundown on september 1 slocum make he reconnaissanace the next morning find the town empty accept the surrender of the mayor and occupy the city a little before noon

deploy the fourth corps assault and carry a small portion of the enemy work but could not hold possession of the gain for want of cooperation from the balance of the line that night a note write in slocum s hand and date from inside the capture city come to sherman state that the twentieth corps be in possession of atlanta before make the news public sherman send an officer with the note to thoma in a short time the officer return and thoma follow on he heel the cautious thoma re-examine the note and then make up he mind that it be genuine snap he finger whistle and almost dance in he exuberance the next day sherman issue he order end the campaign and pull he army back to atlanta the measure of combat efficiency in an indecisive campaign be a matter of personal choice sherman lay great store by place capture hood refuse to notice anything except capture gun and color by both standard thoma have the right to be proud thoma thank he man for they tenacity of purpose unmurmuring endurance cheerful obedience brilliant heroism and high quality in battle sherman feel that he own part in the campaign be skillful and well execute but that the slowness of a part of he army rob he of the large fruit of victory he suppose the military world would approve of he accomplishment whatever the military world think the political world approve it wholeheartedly for some time despondency in some northern quarter have be display in two way an eagerness for peace and a dissatisfaction with lincoln proposal be in the air for a year s armistice lincoln be sure that he would not be re-elect in the midst of this gloom at 1005 pm on september 2 slocum s telegram to stanton general sherman have take atlanta shatter the talk of a negotiate peace and boost lincoln into the white house to the republican no victory could have be more complete official congratulations shower upon sherman and he army lincoln mention they distinguish ability courage and perseverance he feel that this campaign would be famous in the annal of war grant call it prompt skillful and brilliant halleck describe it a the most brilliant of the war actually the atlanta campaign be a military failure next good to destroy an army be to deprive it of it freedom of action sherman have accomplish this much of he job and then inexplicably nullify it by he thirty-mile retreat from lovejoy s to atlanta but so far a it territorial objective be concern the campaign be successful within the narrow frame of military tactic too the expert agree that the campaign be brilliant in seventeen week the military front be drive southward more than 100 mile there be a battle on an average of once every three week the skirmish be almost constant in the summary of the principal event of the campaign compile from the official record there be only ten day which show no fight the casualty in the army of the cumberland be 22807 while for all three army they be 37081 man be kill in they camp at they meal and in they sleep rifle fire often keep the oppose gunner from man they piece modern warfare be bear in this campaign periscope camouflage booby trap land mine extend order trench raid foxhole armored car night attack flare sharpshooter in tree interlace vine and treetop which be the forerunner of barbed wire trip wire to thwart a cavalry charge which presage the i trap and the general use of anesthetics the use of map coordinate be begin when the senior officer begin to select tactical point by designate a spot a near the letter o in the word mountain a few week late the map be be divide into square and a position be describe a be about lot 239 247 and 272 with picket forward a far a 196 this system be dependent upon identical map and thoma supply they from a mobile lithograph press order of the day begin to specify the standard map for the movement sherman prove that a railway base could be movable and the most brilliant feature of the atlanta campaign be the rapid repair of the track to the rebel it seem a if sherman carry tunnel and bridge in he pocket the whistle of sherman s locomotive often drown out the rattle of the skirmish fire a always the rank work out new and good tactic but there be brilliance in the way the field command adopt these method and in the way the army commander incorporate they into they military think the fossilize formalize precedent-based think of the legendary military brain be not evident in sherman s army sherman could never be accuse of stick too long with the old one of sherman s most serious shortcoming however be he mistrust of he cavalry he never see that it be a complement to he infantry and not a substitute for it then in some way this lack of faith in the cavalry become mix up in he mind with the drag effect of wagon train and be harden into a prejudice a horse need twenty pound of food a day but the infantryman get along with two pound the horseman require eleven time more than the footman so sherman try a compromise he would ship by rail five pound per day per animal and the other fifteen pound that be need could be pick up off the country it fail to work already debilitate by the chattanooga starvation the quality of sherman s horseflesh run downhill a the campaign progress every record request by thoma for a delay in a flank movement or an advance be to gain time to take care of he horse well lead properly organize cavalry in it complementary role to infantry have four function first it could locate the enemy infantry learn what they be do and hold they until the heavy foot column could come up and take over second it could screen it own infantry from the sight of the enemy third it could threaten at all time and destroy when possible the enemy communication it could reach key tactical point fast than infantry and destroy they or hold they a the case might be for the foot soldier it climactic role be to pursue and demoralize a defeat enemy but this chance never come in the atlanta campaign thoma try hard to have he cavalry ready for the test it be to meet but he plan be wreck when it be force into a campaign without optimum mobility and with it commander strip from it sherman know the use of cavalry a well a thoma but he imagine a move base with infantry wing instead of cavalry wing he conception prove workable but slow and it enable he enemy to make clean deft well organize retreat with small materiel loss sherman insist that cavalry could not successfully break up hostile railway yet garrard s covington raid and rousseau s opelika raid cut two-third of the rail line he have to break and sherman live in mortal fear of what for might do to he communication when mcpherson push blindly through snake creek gap in a potentially decisive movement the only cavalry in he van be the ninth illinois mount infantry totally inadequate for it role it stumble on infantry where no infantry should have be and mcpherson s aggressive impulse fade out overwhelm by fear of the unknown a proper cavalry command in he front would have develop the fact that he have run into one division of polk s army of the mississippi move up from the direction of mobile to join johnston at dalton from the night of august 30 to the morning of september 2 there be no union cavalry east of the macon railway to disclose to sherman that he be miss the great opportunity of he career a great part of the time thoma infantry never know the location of the enemy line at such time thoma wonder when and where a counterattack would strike he it be the hard way to fight a war but thoma do it without make any disastrous mistake heat during the atlanta campaign couple with unsuitable clothing cause individual irritation that be compound by a lack of opportunity to bathe and shift into clean clothing to relieve the itch and sweat gall the man get into the water whenever they could and since each sizable stream be generally the divide line between the army the picket declare a private truce while the man go swim johnston believe that sherman put he naked engineer into the swim party to locate the various ford lieutenant colonel jame p wordlow who command the first brigade of thoma first cavalry division be order across one of these ford the water be deep and wordlow take he trooper across naked except for gun cartridge box and hat they kick they horse through the deep water with they bare heel drive the rebel out of they rifle pit and capture four man most of the rebel get away since they could make good time through the stiff brush than they naked pursuer rank be become an explosive issue in all three of sherman s army merit recommendation from army commander be pass over in favor of political appointee from civil life
