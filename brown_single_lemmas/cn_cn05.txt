cheek and he try to step back she swing the quirt again and this time he catch she wrist and pull she out of the saddle she come down against he and he try to break she fall he grab she by the shoulder and go down on one knee take she weight so that some of the wind be drive out of he it make he a little sick and he let go of she he get up slowly and she be already on she foot and he stand

man she be nt mister the voice come from behind he and wilson turn the fire have go down and the man be only a shadow against the tree but a moment late he bring he horse forward into the light and wilson have a good look at he he be tall and dark-skinned a half-breed wilson think and he be handsome despite the long thin scar that slant across he cheek she s not a man mister he say i be if you ve get any idea he raise the winchester and point it at wilson s chest put the rifle down joseph the girl say she seem irritate i think i tell you to stay home the half-breed ease the winchester down and rest it across he lap the scar look pure white in the half-darkness he eye be black and deep-set and expressionless you should nt be ride up here after dark judith he say quietly i can take care of this it s no job for you the girl tap the quirt impatiently against she knee and glare at he he take it without flinch i say go home joseph you ve get no business up here the half-breed do nt answer this time but the scar seem to pull hard at the corner of he mouth and he eye be hurt and angry it make wilson wonder he watch the half-breed a he turn silently they could hear the pony s foot on the dry leave for a while then the sound fade out wilson brush the dust from he coat who be that he ask you personal guard you re pretty hard on he he work for i father the girl say and then seem to change she mind he s a friend he name s joseph sanchez be there anything else you want to know not now wilson say i guess i ll find out soon enough you ve get blood on you cheek not yours i it must have get there when you fall against i she wipe it off with the sleeve of she coat i ll bet that s a close a you ve be to a man since you be a baby wilson say he see she hand start to work down the leather thong toward the handle of the quirt and he grab she wrist oh no he say and he be without humor now i ve have enough of that i ve have enough of you i do nt know what go on around here and i do nt care i do nt know what make you think you can get away with this kind of business and i do nt care about that either you take i by surprise but i ll know how to handle you next time she bring up she free hand to hit he but this time he be quick he side-step she blow and she fall stumble against the gelding she finally regain she balance and get up in the saddle she hat have come off and fall behind she shoulder hold by the string and he could see she face more clearly than he have at any time before he have forget that she be so pretty but she prettiness be what he have notice first and all the other thing have come afterward cruelty meanness self-will he have know woman like that one woman in particular and one have be too many he watch the girl until she have go into the tree and wait until he could nt hear the sound of she horse any long then go up to where the child be sleep they be nt sleep of course but they think they be do he a favor by pretend he have nt show up too well in they eye let himself be browbeaten by a woman they expect great thing from he regardless of how try the circumstance and they be disappoint and determine not to show it they lie a little too stiffly with they eye strain to stay close go to sleep he say both of you there s good thing to do than listen to something like that i ll be down at the creek finish the dish if you want i he find the pan where he have drop it and carry it back down to the stream the coyote be call again and he hope that this time there would be no other sound to interrupt it not tonight at any rate he have a feel that the girl mean trouble if she do he could stand it good in the light he scrub absent-mindedly at the pan and reflect on how thing have turn out that afternoon when they have pull up in front of the broken-down ranch house he hope have be high already some of the pain have go from amelia s death not all of it there would still be plenty of moment of regret and sadness and guilty relief but they be start a new life and they have almost everything they need land a house two whiteface bull three horse the land be nt all wilson have expect of it six hundred and forty acre the old man back in st louis have say good grass good water well the grass be there though in some place the ground be too steep for a cow to get to it the water be there so much of it that it spread all through the dead orchard and there be a house livable perhaps but badly in need of repair in the last analysis though wilson have little cause to complain the place have be cheap just the little he have leave after amelia s burial and it would serve it purpose there be only one place where jake carwood s description have go badly awry the peace and quiet it have nt start out that way and he have a feel thank to the girl that thing would get bad before they get good 2 they have the house clean up by noon and wilson send the boy out to the meadow to bring in the horse he stand on the porch and watch he struggle with the heavy harness and finally go over to help he kathy be already in the wagon they be go to town and they be both excite wilson back the team into the trace and wish they be nt go to town at all he have an uneasy feel about it that girl last night what be she name judith pierce it be the only thing about she that be the least bit hard to remember he finish with the team and fill he pipe and stand look about he he have spend two hour ride around the ranch that morning and in broad daylight it be even less invite than judith pierce have make it seem there be brush and stand of pine that no grass could grow under and place so steep that cattle would nt stop to graze but there be water there be an artificial lake just out of sight in the first stand of tree feed by a half dozen spring that pop out of the ground above the hillside orchard yes there be plenty of water too much and that be probably the trouble there be track of cattle all over he six hundred and forty acre the first part of the road be steep but it leveled off after the second bend and curl gradually into the valley it be hot once they reach the flat and dry but the grass be good a warm breeze play across it move it like wave a red-tailed hawk fly in behind they and stay there watch for any snake or rabbit that they might stir up from the side of the road it take they an hour before they come to the first house of kelseyville the town be about what wilson expect one main street with it row of false-fronted building a water tower a few warehouse a single hotel all dusty and sunbaked the place be quiet
