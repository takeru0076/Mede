must berlin remain divide the inference have be too widely accept that because the communist have succeed in build barricade across berlin the free world must acquiesce in dismemberment of that live city so far a the record be concern the western power have not acquiesce and should not do so though walter ulbricht by grace of soviet tank may be head man in east germany that do not give he any right to usurp the government of east berlin or to absorb that semi-city into the soviet zone the wartime protocol of september 12 1944 designate a special great berlin area comprise the entire city to be under joint occupation it be not a part of any one of the three late four zone for occupation by soviet american british and french troop respectively after the berlin blockade and airlift the council of foreign minister in 1949 declare a purpose to mitigate the effect of the present administrative division of germany and of berlin for some time the communist honore the distinction between the soviet zone of germany and the soviet sector of berlin by promulgate separately the law for the two area then they move office of the east german puppet government into east berlin and begin illegally to treat it a the capital of east germany that this and the close of the east berlin-west berlin border have not be accept by the western government appear in note which britain france and the unite state send to moscow after the latter s gratuitous protest over a visit of chancellor adenauer and other west german official to west berlin the chancellor have a much business there a ulbricht have in east berlin and be certainly less provocative than the juvenile sound-truck taunt of gerhard eisler the british and other reply to that moscow note point out effort of the communist authority to integrate east berlin into east germany by isolate it from the outside and attempt to make it the capital of east germany they insist on the fundamental fact that the whole of berlin have a quadripartite status this be far from acknowledge or recognize those effort a an accomplish fact there remain of course the question of what the west can do beyond diplomatic protest to prevent the illegal effort from become accomplish fact one ground of action certainly exist when fusillade of stray shot go over into west berlin a communist vopos try to gun down flee unarmed resident another remain when an american army car be recover but with a break glass the glass may seem trivial but communist official hooliganism feed on such incident unless they be redress remember the step-by-step fate of danzig and the west german misgiving about salami tactic it be to be hope that the dispatch of general clay to west berlin a president kennedy s representative will mark a stiffen of response not only to future indignity and aggression but also to some that have pass prairie national park thousands of buffalo bison they will never be to the man on the street graze like a mobile word throw-rug upon the roll dusty-green grassland a horizon even and seamless bind the vast sun-bleached dome of sky to earth that picture of the american prairie be a indelibly fix in the memory of those who have study the conquest of the american continent a any late cinema image of the west make in live-oak canyon near hollywood for it be the millions of buffalo and prairie chicken and the endless sea of grass that symbolize for a whole generation of american the abundant supply that be to take many of they westward when the ohio and mississippi valley begin to fill the national park service now propose to preserve an area in pottawatomie county northeast kansas a a prairie national park there the buffalo would roam to be see a a tapestry not a moth-eaten zoo specimen wooded stream valley in the fold of earth would be save grassland would extend unfenced unplowed unbroken by silo or barn a the first settler see they the park service make an impressive ecological and statistical case for create this new park american history should clinch the case when congress be ask to approve whisky on the air a philadelphia distiller be currently breach the customary prohibition against hard-liquor advertise on tv and radio start with small station not member of the national association of broadcaster the firm apparently be seek to break down the anti-liquor barrier in major-market station probably the good answer to this kind of enter wedge be congressional action require the federal communication commission to ban such advertise through it license power the national association of broadcaster code specifically bar hard-liquor commercial past poll of public opinion show popular favor for this policy even the distil spirit institute have long have a specific prohibition why then with these voluntary barricade and some state law bar liquor ad be it necessary to seek congressional action simply because the subvert action of firm that be not member of the distil spirit institute and of radio and tv station that be not member of the nab tend to spread soon some member of the two industry group doubtless will want to amend they code on ground that otherwise they will suffer unfairly from the effort of non-code competitor although the false glamour surround bourbon or other whisky commercial be possibly no more fatuous than the pseudo-sophistication with which tv soft-drink be down or toothpaste apply there be a sad difference between entice a viewer into sip oopsie-cola and gulling he into down bourbon a law be need new york democrat choice register democrat in new york city this year have the opportunity to elect they party s candidate for mayor and other municipal post and the man who will run they party organization in the central contest that for mayor they may have find some pertinent point in what each faction have say about the other mayor robert f wagner must a he opponent demand assume responsibility for he performance in office while all citizen share in blame for lax municipal ethics the wagner regime have see serious problem in the school law enforcement and fiscal policy the mayor be find it awkward to campaign against he own record state controller arthur levitt on the other hand can not effectively deny that he have choose to be the candidate of those party leader who a a rule have show lively interest in political power than in the city s welfare they too have link with the city s ill both man be know to be honest and public-spirited mayor wagner s shortcoming have perhaps be more mercilessly expose than those of mr levitt who leave an impression of quiet competence in he more protect state post a mayor mr levitt might turn out to be more independent than some of he lead supporter would like he election on the other hand would unquestionably strengthen the regular mr wagner might or might not be a new mayor in this third term now that he be free of the pressure of those party leader whom he call boss these be of course the same people whose support he have only now reject to seek the independent vote but he reelection would strengthen the liberal democrat and the labor union who back he if this choice be less exciting than new york democrat may wish it nevertheless must be make the vote still give citizen a voice in the operation of they government and they party little war big test both mr k s have so far continue to speak softly and carry big stick over laos president kennedy already two quiet demand down still refuse thursday to be draw into deliver a public ultimatum to moscow but at the same time he move he helicopter-borne marine to within an hour of the fight and secretary rusk en route to bangkok doubtless be try to make emergency arrangement for the possible entry of australian or thai seato force for mr kennedy speak softly and carry a sizable stick be make the good of a bad situation the new president be in no position to start out he dealing with moscow by issue callable bluff he must show at the outset that he mean exactly what he say in this case he have put the alternative clearly to mr khrushchev for the third time at he press conference mr kennedy say all we want in laos be peace not war a truly neutral government not a cold war pawn at the scene he have just a clearly show he military strength in unprovocative but ready position since laos be of no more purely military value to moscow itself than it be to washington this approach might be expect to head off mr khrushchev for the moment but because of the peculiar nature of the military situation in laos the soviet leader must be tempt to let thing ride a course that would appear to cost he little on the spot but would bog washington in a tactical mess a war go laos be an extremely little one casualty have be run about a dozen man a day the hard core of the pro-communist rebel force number only some 2000 tough viet minh guerrilla fighter but for the unite state and it seato ally to attempt to shore up a less tough less combat-tested government army in monsoon-shrouded road-shy guerrilla-th-wisp terrain be a risk not savored by pentagon planner but if anything can bring home to mr khrushchev the idea that he will not really get much enjoyment from watch this braddock-against-the-indians contest it will probably be the fact that seato force be ready to attempt it plus the fact that moscow have something to lose from close off disarmament and other big negotiation with washington fortunately both the republican and america s chief western ally now be join behind the neutral laos aim of the president actually it would be more accurate to say that the leader of the alliance now have swing fully behind the british policy of seek to achieve a neutral laos via the international bargain table it be ironic that washington be have to struggle so for a concept that for six year it bypass a unreasonable the state department tacitly reject the neutral laos idea after the geneva conference of 1954 and last year washington back the rightist coup that oust neutral premier souvanna phouma but since last fall the unite state have be move toward a pro-neutralist position and now be ready to back the british plan for a cease-fire patrol by outside observer and follow by a conference of interest power the road to a guaranteed-neutral coup-proof laos be today almost a difficult a warfare on that nation s terrain but for the safety of southeast asia and for the sake of the laotian people who would not be well-ruled by either militant minority now engage in the fight this last big effort to seal that country from the cold war have to be make the world await mr khrushchev s choice of alternative a vote for educational tv the senate s overwhelming 64-13 vote to support locally control educational tv effort should be emulate in the low house twice previously the senate have approve measure back etv and the house have let they die but this year prospect may be good the house communication subcommittee be expect to report out a good bill call for the state to match federal fund this year s senate measure would provide each state and the district of columbia with $ 1000000 to be use in support of private state or municipal etv effort the fund would be use for equipment not for land building or operation the relatively few community that have educational station have find they of considerable value but lack money from commercial sponsor the station have have difficulty meet expense or improve they service other community the one to be aid most by the senate bill have have difficulty start such station because of the high initial cost of equipment
