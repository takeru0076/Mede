home he have be a clean orderly man and now he have to hide he annoyance be she just naturally sloppy about everything but she physical appearance he wonder would he have to clean up after she every day clean the kitchen the bathroom and get down on he knee and scrub the kitchen floor then hang up she dress pick up she stocking make the bed while she lie around he straighten up ready to vent he exasperation then grow afraid if he dwell on the indignity he suffer he would lose all respect for she and without the respect he might lose he view of she too what s the matter she ask suddenly nothing nothing at all he say quietly let s go out be those the only shoe you have sam what s the matter with they the heavy thick sole look at they they re an expensive english shoe for walk around a lot i like they sam no one around here wear such heavy sole can nt you get another pair maybe i could he say surprise that she could turn from herself and notice anything about he i ll get an elegant pair of thin-soled italian shoe tomorrow carla and i do nt know why you want to go on wear that outfit she say make a face what s the matter with it he have put on the gray jacket and the dark-gray slack and the fawn-colored shirt he have wear that first night in rome when he have encounter she on the street oh sam you look like a tweedy englishman can nt you wear something else and look a little more a though you belong i do nt mind at all he say delight with she attention change he clothe he put on he dark-blue flannel suit and lay away the gray jacket with the feel that he might be put it aside for good but it be a hopeful sign he tell himself she no long want anything about he to remind she of the circumstance of they meet that first night in parioli that day they loaf around just get the feel of the city they look at the ruin of the old roman wall on the low via veneto then they go to the farnese garden she have some amuse scandal about the farneses in the old day then they take a taxi to trastevere there s a church you should see she say and when they stand by the fountain in the piazza look at santa maria he have to keep a straight face not let on he have be there with alberto he let she tell he all about the church then they have dinner all even she be eloquent and please with herself when they get home at midnight she be tire out and in the morning when he wake up at ten the church bell be ring he have never hear so many bell and a he lie there listen he think of she scold he for he remark when he have look up at the obelisk and the church at the top of the spanish step it be a good thing that she cling to she religion he think she might like to take he to st peter s carla wake up he say shake she it s ten oclock be nt you go out to mass you could take i to st peter s uhhu she mutter come on you ll be late i think i ll sleep in this morning she say drowsily and a she snuggle against he he wonder if she ever go to church why do he want she to go to church he wonder probably because it be a place where she might get a feel of certainty and security it would be good for she it be too bad he have no feel himself for church not he poor mother s fault she would have be good off if she have stick to she bible a for himself he just do nt have the temperament for it from the time he have be at college he have achieve a certain tranquility and composure by accept the fact that there be certain thing he could never know then he think of those old testament figure on the ceiling of the sistine chapel just figure out of a tribal folklore could he honestly believe it would be good for carla to have those old prophet grip she imagination now be a woman though she would take only what she need from church it be too bad he be nt a catholic himself or a protestant or one of those amuse dogmatic atheist or a strict orthodox communist what be the matter with he that they all weary he it be the time he be sure all the ideology change from day to day right under he eye so how could a man look to any one of they for an enlargement of he freedom it be all too weary look somewhere else but where just the same he think ponder over it it would be a good thing for a girl like carla if she get up and go to church a half hour late he get she up to go out for breakfast so the ferraros hear they hurry down the stairs would think they be go to a late mass it seem to he that if the ferraros feel sure of they could place they it would help he to feel more sure of himself with carla since we re have coffee with they this afternoon he say i think i ll ask the daughter if we can pay she to come in every day to clean for we and he wait for she to say oh no i can do it sam there s so little to do why not she say i m not good at that kind of thing this afternoon let s take an air with they let s be fine superior people of great dignity he say a if he be joke if you find it necessary sam go ahead she say turn on the stairs i be what i be i can nt help it she word remain with he worry he for hour he do nt know how she would behave with other people when they walk into the ferraro apartment the old lady bow and smile say softly ciao and put out she hand she little word face wrinkle up she word eye gleam and with she little gesture she say all the courteous thing agnese smile too say ello and then more slowly i be happy and they sit down and begin they little coffee party the ferraros offer they biscuit with the coffee act only a interpreter carla she hand fold on she lap be utterly impersonal she would turn to they then turn to he then turn again watch she he feel like a spectator at a tennis game with the ball be bounce back and forth signora ferraro bob she head encouragingly ask sam about canada have a special interest
