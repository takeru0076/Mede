provide he with fresh idea material this be when he trouble begin not to mention a fledgling artist who he hire and who turn out to have idea of he own with particular respect to the hero s sweetheart-secretary john heffernan play larry larkin the cartoonist carry the show in marvelous fashion he portrayal of an edgy head-in-the-clouds artist be virtually flawless this may be unfortunate perhaps from the standpoint of david hedison providence s contribution to hollywood who be appear by special arrangement with 20th century-fox not that mr hedison do not make the most of he role he do and more but the book be write around a somewhat dizzy cartoonist and it have to be that way a word should be say for gary morgan a broadway youngster who a the adopt son make life miserable for

the lack of beer during a jam session he s mad at a world he do not make furthermore he s something of a scoundrel an artist whose mind and feeling be all finger-tip this be in contrast to the family with whom he board they not only think and feel cliche but live cliche a well it be into this household one erode by irritation that have torture the soul out of it people that george dillon enter at the begin of the play an unsuccessful playwright and actor he have faith only in himself and in a talent he be not sure exist by the end of the third act the artist be dead but the body linger on a shell among other shell not altogether a successful play epitaph for george dillon overcome through sheer vitality and power what in a lesser work might be cripple it be awfully talky for instance and not all of the talk be terribly impressive but it strike spark on occasion and they light cause all else to be forget there be a fine second act a an example one in which samuel groom a dillon have an opportunity to blaze away in one impassioned passage after another this be an exciting young actor to watch just a exciting but in a more technically proficient way be laura stuart whose complete control of she every movement be lovely to watch miss stuart be a intensely vibrant a one could wish almost an icy shriek threaten to explode at any moment also fine be sue lawless a a mother more protective and belligerent than a female spider and just a destructive harold cherry a she scratchy spouse and hildy weissman a a vegetable in human form wallace gray have direct a difficult play here usually well but with just a bit too much physical movement in the first act for i taste still he finale be put together with taste and a most sensitive projection of that pale sustenance despair the warwick musical theater present where s charley with music and lyric by frank loesser direct by christopher hewett choreography by peter conlow musical direction by samuel matlowsky the cast everybody fall in love with amy again last night at the warwick musical theater and shelley berman be to blame one of the fine soft shoe tune ever invent once in love with amy be also of course one of the most tantalizingly persistent of light love lyric to come out of american musical comedy in we era so the audience last night be all ear and eye just after act 2 get a rouse open chorus where s charley and berman sift out all alone on the stage with the amble chord and beat of the song just whisper into be it be greatly to berman s credit that he make no attempt to outdo ray bolger he drop he early and delightful ham which be about the only way to handle the old war horse call charley s aunt and let himself go with a appeal an amy a anybody could ask in brief berman play himself and not bolger the big audience start applaud even before he have finish the whole production this week be fresh and lively the costume be stun evocation of the voluminous gown and picture hat of the gibson girl day the

rest in recent year on he skill a a night club monologist prove himself very much at home in musical comedy sparrow-size virginia gibson with sparkle blue eye and a cheerful smile make a suitably perky amy while melisande congdon a the real aunt be positively monumental in the very good gibson girl manner all tell where s charley ought not to be miss it have a fast pace excellent music expert direction and not only a good comedian but an appeal person in he own right mr berman the broadway theater league of rhode island present c edwin knill s and martin tahse s production of fiorello at veteran memorial auditorium the book be by jerome weidman and george abbott music by jerry bock lyric by sheldon harnick choreography by peter gennaro scenery costume and light by william and jeans eckart musical direction by jack elliott and the production be direct by mr abbott the cast this be one of the happy event of the season the company which perform the pulitzer prize musical here last night and will repeat it twice today be full of bounce the politician be in fine voice the chorines evoke happy memory and the little flower ride to break a lance again i see fiorello perform in new york by the original cast and i think this company be every bit a good and perhaps good certainly in the matter of principal there be nothing lack bob carroll may not bear quite a close a physical resemblance to laguardia a tom bosley do but i be amaze at the way he become more and more fiorello a the even progress until one have to catch one s self up and remember that this be nt really laguardia come back among we again then rudy bond be simply grand a ben the distraught republican party district chieftain and paul lipson a morris the faithful one who never get home to he shirley s dinner be fine too a for the lady they be full of charm and sincerity and deep and abide affection for this hurry drive honest little man charlotte fairchild be excellent a the loyal marie who become the second mrs laguardia sing and act with remarkable conviction jen nelson a thea he first wife manage to make that short role impressive and little zeme north a dora with real spirit and verve be fascinate whether she be sing of she love for floyd the cop who become sewer commissioner and then be promote into garbage or just dance to display she exuberant feeling such fascinate novelty in the score a the fugual treatment of on the side of the angel and politics and poker be handle splendidly and i think rudy bond and he band of tuneful ward-heelers make little tin box even good than it be do by the new york cast all the word of it clever lyric come through with perfect clarity the party at floyd s penthouse give the chorines a chance for a nostalgic frolic through all those hackneyed routine which have become a classic choreographic statement of the era s nonsense laguardia s multi-lingual rally when he be run for congress be well stage and wind up in a wild jewish folk-dance that be really great musical theater martin tahse have establish quite a reputation for himself a a successful stager of tour production not a corner have be visibly cut in this one the set be remarkably elaborate for a road-show that do nt pause long in any one place and they be devise so that they shift with a minimum of interruption or obtrusiveness several time recently i have wonder whether show be be stage for the sake of the script or just to entertain the audience with the spectacle of scenery be shift right in front of they eye i m glad to say there s none of that distraction in this fiorello it have all be do in superb style and the result be a show which deserve the support of every person hereabouts who enjoy good musical theater loew s theater present where the boy be an mgm picture produce by joe pasternak and direct by henry levin from a screenplay by george well the cast since the hero a sterling and upright fellow be a rich word senior while two yalies be cast a virtual rapist i suppose i should disqualify myself from sit in judgment on where the boy be but i shall do nothing of the sort instead and not just to prove i objectivity i hasten to report that it s a highly amuse film which probably do a fairly accurate job of report on the easter vacation shenanigans of collegians down in fort lauderdale and that it seem to come to grip quite honestly with the moral problem that most commonly vex youngster in this age group that be to say sex the answer the girl give strike i a reasonably vary and healthily individual if most of they be nt exactly specific well that s the way it be in life i guess but at least it s reassure to see some teenager who do nt profess to know all the answer and be think about they problem instead where the boy be also have a juvenile bounce that make for a refresh venture in comedy there be some sharp and whip line and some hilariously funny situation the good of the latter be a mass impromptu plunge into a nightclub tank where a mermaid be perform most of the female face be new or at least not too familiar dolore hart be charm in a lead role and quite believable i be delight with paula prentiss comedy performance which be a fresh and unstilted a one s high hope might ask a couple of the male make good comedy too jim hutton and frank gorshin the only performance which be too soft for i be that of yvette mimieux but since someone have to become the victim of despoiler just to emphasize that such thing do happen at these fracases i suppose this be the attitude the part call for i must say however that i prefer the act that have something of a bite edge to it to anyone who remember newport at it less than maximum violence this view of what the boy and girl do in the springtime before they wing north for the jazz festival ought to prove entertain the second feature the price of silence be a british detective story that will talk you head off
