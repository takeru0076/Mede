high-gain photoelectronic image intensification be apply under condition of low incident light level whenever the integration time require by a sensor or record instrument exceed the limit of practicability example of such situation be aerial night reconnaissance the record of radioactive tracer in live body tissue special radiography in medical or industrial application track record of high energy particle etc high-gain photoelectronic image intensification may be achieve by several method some of these be list below a cascade single stage by couple lens system b channel-type secondary emission image intensifier c image intensifier base upon the multipactor principle d transmission secondary electron multiplication image intensifier tsem tube e cascade of single stage enclose in one common envelope cascade single stage by couple lens system be rather inefficient a the lens system limit the obtainable gain quite severely channel-type image intensifier be capable of achieve high-gain value they suffer however from an inherently low resolution image intensifier base upon the multipactor principle appear to hold promise a far a obtainable resolution be concern however the unavoidable low-duty cycle restrict the effective gain tsem tube have be construct show high gain and resolution however electrostatic focus important for many application have not be realize for these device resolution limitation with electrostatic focus might be anticipate due to chromatic aberration furthermore the thin film dynodes appear to have a natural diameter limitation wherever a mesh support can not be tolerate cascade single stage enclose by a common envelope have be construct with high gain and high resolution these tube may differ both in the choice of the electron optical system and in the design of the couple member the electron optical system may be either a magnetic or electrostatic one the magnification may be small equal or large than unity an electrostatic system suffer generally from image plane curvature lead to defocusing in the peripheral image region if a flat view screen or interstage coupler be utilize while a magnetic system require accurate adjustment of the solenoid which be heavy and bulky a it will be discuss late peripheral defocusing can be improve on by utilize curve fiber coupler it should be note however that the paraxial resolution be quite similar for both electron optical system it be feel that fiber-coupled double - and multi - stage image intensifier will gain considerable importance in the future therefore we shall consider in this paper the theoretical gain and resolution capability of such tube the luminous efficiency and resolution of single stage fiber coupler and finally of the composite tube will be compute it will be show theoretically that the high image intensification obtainable with such a tube and contact photography permit the utilization of extremely low incident light level the effect of device and quantum noise associate with such low input level will be describe after these theoretical consideration constructional detail of a fiber-coupled double-stage x-ray image intensifier will be discuss measure performance characteristic for this experimental tube will be list the conclusion shall be reach that fiber-coupled double-stage tube represent a sensible and practical approach to high-gain image intensification basic design of a fiber-coupled double-stage image intensifier the tube design which form the basis of the theoretical discussion shall be describe now the electron optical system see fig 14-1 be base in principle on the focus action of concentric spherical cathode and anode surface the inner anode sphere be pierce elongate into a cup and terminate by the phosphor screen the photoelectrons emit from a circular segment of the cathode sphere be focus by the positive lens action of the two concentric sphere pass through the negative lens form by the anode aperture and impinge upon the cathodoluminescent view screen the cylindrical focus electrode permit adjustment of the positive lens part by vary the focus potential the anode potential codetermines the gain g and magnification m of the stage both the photocathode and the image plane of such an electrode configuration be curve concave a see from the anode aperture the field-flattening property of the biconcave fiber coupler can be utilize to alleviate the peripheral resolution loss result with a flat phosphor-screen or couple member for the same reason the output fiber plate be planoconcave it expose flat side permit contact photography if a permanent record be desire a it will be show late the field-flattening property of the interstage and output fiber coupler comprise indeed the main advantage of such a design the second photocathode and both phosphor surface be deposit on the fiber plate substrate the photocathode sensitivity s phosphor efficiency p and anode potential v of the individual stage shall be distinguish by mean of subscript 1 and 2 in the text where require both stage be assume to have unity magnification theoretical discussion of flux gain flux gain of a single stage the luminous gain of a single stage with afj flux gain be to a first approximation give by the product of the photocathode sensitivity s amp lumen the anode potential v volt and the phosphor conversion efficiency p lumen in general p be a function of v and the current density but it shall here be assume a a constant the luminous efficiency afj of a photocathode depend on the maximum radiant sensitivity afj and on the spectral distribution of the incident light afj by the relation afj where afj be normalize radiant photocathode sensitivity afj be standard visibility function the luminous flux gain of a single stage be give by afj if the input light distribution fall beyond the visible range afj a expect since afj such case be not consider here efficiency of fiber coupler the efficiency of fiber optics plate depend on four factor a numerical aperture na b end fresnel reflection loss r c internal loss il d pack efficiency fr the numerical aperture of the fibers be give by afj where afj the angle afj be measure in the medium of index afj settle phosphor a generally use in image intensifier have low optical contact with the substrate surface hence afj shall be assume the numerical aperture should be in general close to unity this condition can be satisfy eg with afj and afj or equivalent glass combination a sufficiently good approximation for determine the end reflection loss r can be obtain from the angle independent fresnel formula afj for phosphor to fiber and fiber to air surface and assume afj we obtain afj percent this value may be reduce to 46 percent by mean of a very thin glass layer of index 15 hence the afj factor for the output fiber coupler be afj a the index of refraction of photosensitive surface of the sbcs-type lie around 2 the fresnel loss at the fiber-photocathode interface be about 05 percent and the afj factor for the interstage coupler be 095 it might be anticipate that multiple coating will reduce end reflection loss even far the internal loss be due to absorption and the small but finite loss suffer in the numerous internal reflection due to deviation from the prescribe cylindrical fiber cross-section and minute imperfection of the core-jacket interface these loss depend on fiber diameter and length absorption coefficient the mean value of the loss per internal reflection and last but not least on the angular distribution of the incident light explicit expression integral average be give in the literature lack reliable data for some of the variable we be rely on experimental data of about 20 percent internal loss for 14-inch long small 5 - 10 m diameter fibers this relatively high value be probably due to the small fiber diameter increase the number of internal reflection since we be consider here relatively small diameter 1 - 15 inch fiber plate they average thickness can be keep below 14 inch and they internal loss may be assume a 15 percent per plate the pack efficiency fr of fiber plate do not receive much attention in the literature probably a it be high for the large fibers generally use until rather recently for circular fibers in a closely pack hexagonal array the pack efficiency be give by afj where afj and 0906 be the ratio of the area of a circle to that of the circumscribe hexagon for the small diameter fibers now technically feasible and require for about 100 afj resolution afj the clad thickness be about 05 m hence afj and afj thus the efficiency \*\* yt coupler be give by afj or approximately 50 percent each it must be remember that the fiber plate replace a glass window and a mica membrane in addition to an optical output lens system the efficiency afj of an afj lens at the magnification afj be afj neglect absorption the end loss of the couple membrane and the output window afj would be 6 percent and 8 percent thus the combine efficiency of the element replace by the two fiber plate with a combine efficiency of 025 be 0043 or about six time less than that of the two fiber plate gain of fiber couple image intensifier include the brightness gain afj due to the afj area demagnification the overall gain of a fiber couple double stage image intensifier be afj it be obvious that the careful choice of photocathode which maximize afj for a give input e in the case of the second stage for the first phosphor screen emission be very important the same consideration should govern the choice of the second-stage phosphor screen for match with the spectral sensitivity of the ultimate sensor eg photographic emulsion we have evaluate the match integral for two type of photocathodes s-11 and s-20 and three type of light input the input light distribution consider be p-11 and p-20 phosphor emission and the so-called night light nl a give by hw babcock and jj johnson the integral in unit be list in table 14-1 below theoretical discussion of paraxial device resolution resolution limitation in a single stage the resolution limitation for a single stage be give by the inherent resolution of the electron optical system a well a the resolution capability of the cathodoluminescent view screen the resolution capability of an electrostatic system depend on both the choice of magnification and chromatic aberration it have be state previously that a minifying electrostatic system yield a low resolution than a magnify system or a system with unity magnification furthermore the chromatic aberration depend on the choose high voltage in general a high anode voltage reduce chromatic aberration and thus increase the obtainable resolution the luminous gain of the discuss tube be calculate from eq 6 for the 16 possible combination of s-11 and s-20 photocathodes and p-11 and p-20 phosphor screen for night light and p-20 light input the p-20 input be of interest because it correspond roughly to the light emission of conventional x-ray fluorescent screen the follow efficiency obtain from jedec and rca specification be use afj the follow table 14-2 list the luminous gain value compute accord to eq 6 with afj the possibility of a space charge blowup of the screen crossover of the elementary electron bundle have be point out it be obvious that such an influence can only be expect in the final stage of an image intensifier at rather high output level space charge influence will also decrease at increase voltage electrostatic system of the pseudo-symmetric type have be test for resolution capability by apply electronography a resolution of 70 - 80 line-pairs per millimeter appear to be feasible the inherent resolution of a cathodoluminescent phosphor screen decrease with increasingly aggregate thickness with increase anode voltage decrease with decrease porosity thus the advantage of cathodophoretic phosphor deposition and might be impair by the normally use aluminum mirror thus in general elementary light optical effect light scatter and electron scatter determine the obtainable resolution limit it should be note that photoluminescence due to bremsstrahlung generate within the view screen by electron impact appear to be important only if anode voltage in excess of 30 kv be utilize it have be state that settle cathodoluminescent phosphor screen may have a limit resolution of 60 afj at high voltage value of approximately 20 afj for the far discussion we shall thus assume an electron optical resolution of 80 afj and phosphor screen resolution of 60 afj
