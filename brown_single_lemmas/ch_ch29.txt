in recent month much attention have be give to the probable extent of the current downtrend in business and economist be somewhat divide a to the outlook for the near future and yet despite some disappointment with the performance of this first year of the new decade 1960 have be a good year in many way with many overall measure of business have reach new peak for the year a a whole the shift in sentiment from excessive optimism early in the year to the present mood of caution have probably be a good thing in that it have prevent the accumulation of the burdensome inventory that have characterize many previous swing in the business cycle this caution have be particularly noticeable in a tendency of retailer and distributor to shift the inventory burden back on the supplier and the fact stock at retail be low in many line have escape attention because of the presence of high stock at the manufacture level in the electronics industry this tendency be well illustrate by inventory of tv set factory stock in recent month have be the high they have be in three year while those at retail be below 1959 the total value of we industry s shipment at factory price increase from $ 92 billion in 1959 to approximately $ 101 billion a a result of increase in all of the major segment of we business home entertainment military industrial and replacement i believe a far gain be in prospect for 1961 home entertainment sales up reflect the large percentage of high-end set such a console and combination since 1953 dollar value of home entertainment electronics in 1960 be about $ 19 billion compare to $ 17 billion in 1959 sales of tv set at retail run ahead of the like month of 1959 through july set production exclude those destined for the export market also run ahead in the early month but be curtail after the usual vacation shutdown in the face of grow evidence that some of the early production plan have be overly optimistic for the year a a whole retail sales of tv set probably come to 58 million against 57 million in 1959 however production come to only 56 million compare to 62 million in contrast to the low turnout of tv total radio production increase from 154 million set to 167 million exclude export both home and auto radio be in excellent demand with retail sales of home set ahead of 1959 in every month of the first eleven sales and production of home set be about equal at 104 million unit auto set production come to about 63 million compare to 56 million in 1959 separate phonograph also have a good year reflect the grow popularity of stereo sound and the same tendency on the part of the consumer to upgrade that characterize the radio-tv market the outlook for entertainment electronics in 1961 be certainly far from clear at present but recent survey have show a desire on the part of consumer to step up they buy plan for durable goods i would expect that sales at retail in the first half of 1961 might be below 1960 by some 10 - 15 % but that second-half level should show a favorable comparison with a possibility of quite strong demand late in the year if business condition recover a some recent forecast suggest they will i look for tv sales and production to be approximately equal at 57 million set for the year but i look for some decline in radio from the high rate in 1961 to more nearly the 1959 level of 150 - 155 million set i therefore believe it be realistic to assume a modest drop in the total value of home entertainment electronics to about $ 18 million slightly below 1960 but above 1959 military electronics to grow 1960 witness another substantial increase in we industry s shipment of military electronics which total about $ 54 billion compare to $ 49 billion in 1959 it be interest to note that the present level of military electronics procurement be great than the industry s total sales to all market in 1950-1953 which be good year for we industry with television enjoy it initial period of rapid consumer acceptance it have be correctly point out by well-informed people in the industry that it be probably unrealistic to expect a continuation of the yearly growth of 15 % or good that characterize the decade of the 1950 s and that we military market may be enter upon a new phase in which procurement of multiple weapon system will give way to concentration of still undeveloped area of we defense capability while this may well be true in general i believe it be also important to keep in mind that some recent development suggest that over the next year or so military electronics may be one of the most strongly grow area in an economy which be not expand rapidly in other direction among the item schedule for acceleration in the near future be the polaris and b70 program strengthen of the airborne alert system of the strategic air command and improve battlefield surveillance system research and development expenditure connect with the reconnaissance satellite samo and the future development of ballistic missile defense system such a nike-zeus be expect to increase substantially research development test and evaluation fund devote to missile in 1960 be 3 to 4 time a large a those devote to aircraft and actual missile procurement be expect to exceed aircraft procurement by 1963 still late the realm of space technology will show substantial gain it have be estimate that spend by the national aeronautics and space administration will rise from less than $ 500 million in fiscal 1960 to more than $ 2 billion by 1967 and that the electronic industry s share of these expenditure will be close to 50 % than the current 20 % the stepped-up defense procurement call for in the 1961 budget have already begin to make itself feel in an upturn in order for military electronic equipment and the component that go into it and it have be suggest that an additional $ 2 billion increase in total defense spend may be request for fiscal 1962 although the impact of these increase on we industry s shipment will be gradual on balance i look for another good increase in shipment in the come year to at least $ 6 billion industrial electronic equipment pace by the continue rapid growth of electronic data process sales of industrial and commercial electronic equipment total $ 18 billion compare to $ 16 billion in 1959 the market for computer and other data-handling continue to expand at the rate of about 30 % annually reach some $ 450 million in 1960 inform estimate look for this market to approximately quadruple by the late 1960 s under the stimulus of new application in the field of bank and retail industrial process control and information storage and retrieval in the industrial field prospect for high expenditure on electronic test and measure equipment be also quite bright for the near term however it must be realize that the industrial and commercial market be somewhat more sensitive to general business condition than be the military market and for this reason i would expect that any gain in 1961 may be somewhat small than those of recent year sales should slightly exceed 1960 however and reach $ 19 billion replacement part in addition to the three major original equipment segment of the electronics business the steady growth in the market for replacement part continue year by year this be now a $ 10 billion business up from $ 09 billion in 1959 and should reach $ 11 billion in 1961 the market for electronic part in 1960 have reflect the change pattern of the various end equipment segment of the industry demand for part for home entertainment be strong in the first half but purchase be cut back to low level during the fall a set manufacturer reduce they own operate rate in the military field income order turn down early in the year and remain rather slow until late fall when the upturn in procurement of equipment begin to make itself feel in rise order for component sales of transistor in 1960 exceed $ 300 million compare to $ 222 million in 1959 despite substantial price reduction in virtually all type production total about 123 million unit against 82 million in 1959 and i look for a far gain to 188 million unit worth approximately $ 380 million in 1961 sales of passive component such a capacitor and resistor although not grow a fast a those of semi-conductor be ahead of 1959 this year and should increase again in 1961 in sum i look for another good year for the electronics industry in 1961 with total sales increase about 7 % to $ 108 billion despite the uncertainty in the business outlook generally a i have indicate above i base this feel on a belief that current weakness in the market for consumer durable goods may continue through the early month of the year but will give way to a sufficiently strong recovery late on to bring the full-year figure close to those of 1960 on prospect for continue increase in defense spend and on continue growth in the application of electronics to the complex problem of manufacture and trade in the expand but competitive economy of the 1960 s the appointment of gilbert b devey a general manager of vectrol engineering inc of stamford connecticut
