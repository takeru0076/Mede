sixty mile north of new york city where the wooded hill of dutchess county meet the broad sweep of the hudson river there be a new home development call oakwood height a a matter of fact you could probably find a new home development in every populate county in the country with three-bedroom ranch style cottage in the $ 14000 range but oakwood height be unique in one particular it oil for heat be meter monthly to each home from a line that start at a central storage point this be a pilot operation sponsor by a new entity charter in delaware a the tri-state pipeline corporation with principal office in new york state it president be otis m water partner in the law firm of timen & water 540-k chrysler bldg new york city vice-president be louis berkman and the secretary-treasurer be mark ritter ritter be the builder of oakwood height and president of kahler-craft distributor inc newburgh ny the idea of a central tank with line to each house be not in itself a novelty not a year go by but what several local company in the we and canada even overseas write to fueloil & oil heat to inquire if it s feasible and where it be be do it editor only know of one example to point to a public house development of 278 home in new haven describe by john schulz in the march 1950 issue this have survive the year but there have be considerable concern among the tenant over the fact that the oil be not meter rather the monthly total consumption be divide and charge on the basis of number of room and person in the family common complaint include mrs murphy leave she window open all the time a fresh air fan or the family be visit aunt minnie with the house shut up but they still pay the same rate for oil a a result of that attitude other have be discourage from try central distribution a new low capacity meter be the key that unlock the situation at oakwood height call a slo-flo meter it be design for this job by power plus industry of los angeles a key individual be don nelson tri-state have acquire it exclusive distribution for the northern principal heat state there s an advantage in have a firm like tri-state head by a lawyer the early new haven development be public house so it easily leap over the problem meet in a private venture these have to do with property right municipal official attitude and a host of other in work out the practical legal conclusion president water be not think only of this pilot project for it be plan to duplicate this program or system in other builder development nationally it be always difficult or at least time-consuming to get approval of any kind of line under a public street a one example to overcome this the builder lay and complete the street himself then deed it to the community while retain a perpetual easement for the oil line when a family buy a home the title be subject to a perpetual easement to tri-state for the central storage tri-state buy one acre bury it tank and simply hold permanent title to that piece in other word the whole storage and pipeline system do not belong to the homeowner nor to the town but rather to tri-state how do tri-state get it revenue from this plan it lease the whole facility to a large oil company at least large enough to have a strong credit position this first test be be lease for ten year but future project will require at least 15 year the amount pay by the oil company to tri-state for the use of it oil distribution system and the privilege of supply all the home be subject to negotiation but naturally must be profitable to both party on this first venture the central storage be 20000 gallon in two tank or an average of 400 gallon for each of the 50 home the supplier deliver at he convenience in transport load so a to maintain two-to-three week reserve supply against weather contingency however that be not all he have to do he must undertake complete service of the oilheating equipment to assure fine heat in the present project the heat be by circulate hot water from paragon boiler-burner unit with summer-winter domestic hot water hookups again the oil man must read the meter at such interval a he find good for this first development the supplier sign the lease be a major oil company but in turn the deal be be transfer for operation to it local fueloil distributor the major get the assure gallonage for the life of the lease and the distributor apparently can do well because delivery cost be low initial consideration the officer of the new corporation have naturally explore many angle a well a personality that might be affect for example the official of poughkeepsie town township where the project be locate think highly of it because it simplify they snow clear problem the central storage be near a main artery quite easy to reach with large transport on a short crescent swing with fewer truck in the residential street the public service commission have rule that this be not a public utility subject to they many regulation several financial institution both bank and insurance company have be sound out they like it and would supply most of the capital because of the long term lease by strong oil company the government house agency consider it feasible with one special stipulation there must be a restriction in the deed to provide that the customer may not be charge more than the current market price for the oil an obvious precaution since the account be permanently wed just like with gas or electricity for a few detail of the system the line be 1-14 x-tru-coat a product of republic steel corp and all line be weld they be lay a minimum of 24 deep and in some area four foot down particularly under road to stay clear of all other pipe such a water and sewer and to minimize shock from heavy truck the meter be mount high on the basement wall it figure be a half inch high and very easy to read even into tenth gallon it will accommodate fire rate a low a a half gallon an hour ritter the builder be convince that the total cost of all the heat system plus the oil distribution system be no great than would be gas heat system in the house plus they line and meter he believe that this be a sound approach to gas competition in builder development where gas be available it would be pretty difficult to install a tri-state system in old neighborhood and that s an understatement the job of get property easement and street easement and the acre for the tank would become pretty discourage but in a new development where everything start from scratch the solution be simple future plan what do tri-state actually want to do now that it have the meter under franchise and certain phase of it pipe system in the patent apply for stage it want to interest builder and oil company in the idea of include it facility in they new home project by finance and install the storage pipe and meter and lease these for 15 year with renewal option to a strong oil company it may also work in one other way by license it system patent and supply the meter let the oil company or even the builder install the facility this whole development be certain to be of interest to the reader for the idea have so often be mention somewhat wistfully but it s too early yet to go visit oakwood height only eight of the 50 house be complete at the time of the editor s visit on june 8th other be build the big tank be at the site but still sun themselves a big mechanical ditcher be run the trench and the town build inspector be pay a friendly if curious visit the oilheating industry be look up lead by a revival of research and development a primary ingredient in these field be imagination and tri-state pipeline corporation deserve a very good mark every year about this time national gargle you cool system week roll around it pay in the long hot run to take good care of the water work do it this way for the summer gargle first drain that old coolant down the storm sewer do nt save the anti-freeze even if it the expensive permanent type the word mean it will nt boil away easily nothing else the rust inhibitor in the fluid be use up after one year and you do nt want to risk the rust that two year use could mean pitch it out if a lot of rust show in the drain use a good flush clean then fill the system and add a rust inhibitor of course you ll want to use the soft water you can in you radiator now check for leak in you hose and hose connection around the freeze-out plug gasket water pump seal and heater fitting next run the engine and let it heat up so the thermostat open and then look for leak again be sure the bug and dirt be blow out of the radiator fin use the air hose for this job check the temperature gage and be sure it be work if you use one of the new year-round cool system fluid such a dowguard be sure to check it dow say that the fluid can be use now for two year check it inhibitor effectiveness before leave it in during the summer take precaution now to be sure you avoid those unpleasant and costly heat breakdown when the temperature zoom this summer do nt let you mechanic pull the thermostat out of those fueloil delivery truck or installation rig of yours spring and summer may be here officially but those thermos stay in the fact be that remove and leave out a thermostat from any water cool vehicle will greatly increase the fuel consumption reduce power and contribute to spark plug foul due to an accumulation of excessive carbon deposit on the insulator if you run into excess plug foul on one truck check to be sure that the rig have a thermostat the thermostat be important to get you engine up to operate temperature quickly and to keep it run at it most efficient temperature through the proper circulation of the coolant be you pay too much for you truck insurance there s a good chance you be double on some coverage not take discount come to you and not cut some corner that can be cut have a talk with you insurance agent be careful that you keep adequate coverage but look for place to save money first go over the type of coverage you now have look for these feature which may mean you can save duplicate coverage avoid double up on the same item for example do nt pay in a truck policy for medical coverage that you may be pay for in a health and accident policy do you policy have a lay-up clause this mean that if you insure vehicle be lay up for more than 30 day insurance can be suspend and a proportionate return of you premium make to you this apply to repair work of winter storage the figure five be important in insurance with many company policy you get a fleet discount if you insure five or more rig this mean either car or truck discount run up to 2 % of cost usually premium reduction can be obtain by apply deductible to you liability plan for example if you bodily injury claim start payment after the first $ 250 a 25 % premium save be often make
