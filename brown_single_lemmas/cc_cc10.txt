fascinate story start once more one be not sure who emerge a the main personality of this book mijbil with he rollicking way or maxwell himself poet portrait painter writer journalist traveller and zoologist sensitive but never sentimental recorder of an unusual way of life in a language at once lyrical and forceful vivid and unabashed this reviewer read the book when it be first bring out in england with a sense of discovery and excitement now gavin maxwell s ring of bright water have widen to enchant the world new york the performance of the comedie francaise be the most important recent event in the new york theater they serve to contradict a popular notion that the comedie merely repeat a accurately a possible the technique of act the classic that prevail in the 17th century on the contrary the old play be continually be reinterprete and each new production of a classic have only a brief history at the comedie of course the well-received revival last long than the other and that far remind we that the comedie be not insensitive to criticism the director of the comedie do not respond to adverse notice in a docile and subservient a manner a the broadway producer who in two instance this season close they play after one performance but they be aware of the world outside they court public approval they delight in full house and they occasionally dare to experiment in interpret a dramatic classic in france novel approach to the classic french play be frequently attempt the government pay a subsidy for revival of the classic and this policy attract experimenter who sometimes put moliere s character in modern dress and often achieve interest result so far a i know the comedie have never put moliere s people in the costume of the 20th century but they do reinterpret play and character last season the comedie s two principal experiment come to grief and in consequence we can expect fairly soon to see still new production of racine s phedre and moliere s school for wife the new phedre be do in 17th century set instead of ancient greek perhaps that be the comedie s equivalent for thrust this play s character into we own time the speak of the line seem excessively slow and stately possibly in an effort to capture the spirit of 17th century elegance a few literary man defend what they take to be an emphasis on the poetry at the expense of the drama but the response be mainly hostile and quite violent the new school for wife be interpret accord to a principle that be become increasingly common in the play of classic comedy the idea of turn some obviously ludicrous figure into a tragic character among the moliere specialist of some year ago louis jouvet try to humanize some of the clown while fernand ledoux often perform at the comedie make they more gross than moliere may have intend apparently jouvet and ledoux attempt just these dissimilar approach in the role of arnolphe in the school for wife i say apparently although i see jouvet a arnolphe when he visit this country shortly before he death by that time he seem to have drop the tragic play of the last moment of the comedy arnolphe it will be recall be a man of mature year who try to preserve the innocence of he youthful wife-to-be the part can lend itself to serious treatment one influential french critic remark pity for arnolphe come with age accordingly at the comedie last year jeans meyer play a sympathetic arnolphe and draw criticism for turn the comedy into a tragedy but the stuff of tragedy be not truly present and the play become only comedy act rather slowly wisely the comedie have bring moliere s tartuffe on it tour and have leave the school for wife at home tartuffe be the religious hypocrite who court he benefactor s wife jouvet play he a a sincere zealot and ledoux at the comedie make he a gross buffoon or so the historian tell we louis seigner who formerly play the delude benefactor opposite ledoux be the tartuffe of the present production which he himself direct he tartuffe observe the golden mean he red face he coarse gesture and he lustful stare bespeak he sensuality but he heavenward glance and he pious speech be not merely perfunctory of course they do not reflect sincerity but they exhibit a concern to make a good job out of he pious impersonation occasionally seigner draw some justly deserve laugh by he quick shift from one personality to another the whole role by the way be a considerable transformation for anyone who have see seigner in he other part he normal specialty be play the good-natured old man frequently stupid or delude but never mean or sly here he be quite persuasively the very embodiment of meanness and slyness seigner be the dean of the company the old actor in point of continuous service in that function he help to rebut another legend about the comedie we be often tell that the comedie have unfortunately life-contracts with old actor who be both mediocre and lazy draw they pay without much act but probably do real service to the comedie by stay off the stage seigner however be a fine actor and probably the busy man in the company among he other part be the lead in the bourgeois gentleman and the imaginary invalid in moliere s farce the trick of scapin robert hirsch undertake another of the great role here some innovation be attempt to begin with scapin be a trickster in the old tradition of the clever servant who plot the strategy of courtship for he master hirsch s scapin be healthy cheerful energetic revel in he physical agility and he obvious superiority to the young gentleman whom he serve hirsch say that he have give the role certain quality he have observe in the city tough of the real world and surely he scapin have a fresh directness a no-nonsense quality that seem to make he he own master and nobody s servant django reinhardt the ill-fated gypsy be a true artist one who demonstrate conclusively the power of art to renew itself and flow into many channel there be hardly a jazz guitarist in the business today who do nt owe something to django and django owe much to louis armstrong he tell once of how he switch he style of play to jazz after listen to two old armstrong record he buy in the flea market in paris it be the first jazz he have hear django who be bear jeans baptiste reinhardt in belgium and who die in 1953 in france be an extraordinary man most of the finger on he leave hand be burn off when he fall asleep with a cigarette and this be before he begin to play he startlingly beautiful jazz you can catch up with he if you have nt already on rca-victor s album djangology make up of track he record with stephane grappelly and the quintet of the hot club of france this be a choice item and grappely deserve
