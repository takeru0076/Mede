a royal decree issue in 1910 two year after the belgian government assume authority for the administration of the congo prescribe the registration of all adult male by chiefdom far decree along this line be issue in 1916 and 1919 in 1922 a continuous registration of the whole indigenous population be institute by ordinance of the governor-general and the periodic compilation of these record be order but specific procedure for carry out this plan be leave to the discretion of the provincial governor a unify set of regulation applicable to all area be issue in 1929 and a complementary series of demographic inquiry in select area be institute at the same time the whole system be again review and reorganize in 1933 general responsibility for it administration rest with a division of the colonial government concern with labor supply and native affair service des affaire indigenes et de la main-doeuvre aimo afj direction afj direction generale gouvernement generale tribal authority the chief and they secretary be hold responsible for maintain the register of indigenous person within they territory under the general supervision of district official the district official along with they other duty be oblige to organize special demographic inquiry in select area and to supervise the annual tabulation of demographic statistics the regulation require the inscription of each individual male or female adult or child on a separate card fiche the card file by circonscription sub-chiefdom or village be keep in the headquarters of each territoire chiefdom each card be expect to show certain information about the individual concern include he or she date of birth or age at a specify time spouse and child additional entry must be make from time to time different card be use for male and female and a corner be clip from the card of adult and of child when they reach puberty so a quick count could be make at any time even by an illiterate clerk of the number of register person in four age-and-sex class personal identification card be issue to all adult male on which tax payment inoculation period of employment and change of residence be record similar identification card be issue in 1959 to all adult female each adult be hold personally responsible for assure he inscription and obtain an identification card which must be show on demand the registration card of a person leave he home territory for a short period be put into a special file for absent person the card of permanent out-migrants be in theory send to an office in the place of new residence finally the registration of birth and death by near relative be make compulsory in most region number of register person in four age-and-sex class be count each year in addition demographic inquiry supposedly involve field investigation be conduct in select minor division circonscriptions contain about 3 percent of the total population the result of these inquiry be use to adjust compilation of data from the register and to provide various ratio and rate by district include birth and death rate general fertility rate distribution by marital status fertility of wife separately in polygynous and non-polygynous household infant mortality and migration the area to be examine in these inquiry be select by local official supposedly a representative of a large population average of the ratio obtain in a few select area be apply to the large population the scheme in theory be an ingenious adaptation of european registration system to the condition of african life but it place a severe strain on the administrative resource already burden in other way of a widely disperse poor and largely illiterate population the sample program be institute before the principle of probability sample be widely recognize in population study the system be not well adapt to condition of life in urban center the distinction between domicile de jure and present de facto population be not clearly define so the result be subject to considerable confusion the system tend to break down during the war but be reactivate it have reach the pre-war level of efficiency by 1951 in spite of the defect in this system the figure on total population during the late 1930 s and again in the early 1950 s seem to have represent actual condition in most district with approximate fidelity but the information on the dynamics of population be often quite mislead the same system with minor modification be develop in ruanda-urundi under belgian administration here again it seem that useful approximation of the size and geographical distribution of the population be obtain in this way in the late pre-war and early post-war period before consider more recent activity we should note another important aspect of demography in belgian africa a number of strong independent agency establish in some case with governmental or royal support have conduct large medical social educational and research operation in particular part of the congo and ruanda-urundi the work of fond reine elisabeth pour lassistance medicale aux indigenes do congo belge foreami have special interest with respect to demography this agency accept responsibility for medical service to a population range from 638560 person in 1941 to 840503 in 1956 in the kwango district and adjacent area east of leopoldville each year from 1941 on it medical staff have conduct intensive field investigation to determine change in population structure and vital rate and a it primary objective the incidence of major disease it finding be report each year in it rapport sur lactivite pendant annee bruxelles somewhat similar investigation have be make by medical officer in other area other independent or partially independent agency have promote investigation on topic directly or indirectly relate to demography these study vary widely in scope and precision linstitut pour la recherche scientifique en afrique centrale irsac have sponsor well-designed field investigation and have cooperate closely with the government of ruanda-urundi in the development of it official statistics a massive investigation of the characteristic of in-migrant and prospective out-migrants in ruanda-urundi be be carry on by jj maquet former director of the social science branch of irsac now a professor at luniversite officielle do congo belge et do ruanda-urundi some 30000 complete schedule with 20 item collect by sub-chiefs in 1100 circumscription have be tabulate the result be now be analyze statistics have be recognize a a matter of strategic importance in the congo and in ruanda-urundi during the post-war year in connection with long-term economic and social program the aimo organization of both country which maintain administrative service throughout the territory retain immediate responsibility for the collection and publication of demographic information however the statistical office of both government be assign responsibility for the plan and analysis of these statistics a bureau de la demographie a romaniuk director be form under aimo in the congo to work in close rapport with the section statistique of the secretariat general eventually responsibility for demographic inquiry in the congo be transfer to the demographic division of the central statistical office the 1952 demographic inquiry in ruanda-urundi be direct by v neesen a member of the irsac staff though the inquiry be carry out under the auspices of aimo which have continue responsibility for demographic statistics in this territory a member of the irsac staff e van de walle be recently delegate to cooperate with aimo in the development of demographic statistics in this territory the initiation of sample census in ruanda-urundi 1952 and in the congo 1955 - 57 be major advance we will deal first with the program in the congo though this be put into operation late than the other the radical nature of the innovation in the congo be not emphasize in the official announcement the term enquetes demographiques previously use for the supplementary investigation carry out in connection with the administrative census be use for the new investigation however the difference in procedure be fundamental these be a follow 1 field work procedure field operation be transfer from administrative personnel primarily engage in other task to specially train team of full-time african investigator three team each work in two province these team carry out the same operation successively in different area 2 nature of the sample sample area in the new investigation be select strictly by application of the principle of probability theory so a to be representative of the total population of define area within calculable limit in short scientific sample be introduce in place of subjective sample the population of the various district or other major division be stratify by type of community rural urban mix and where appropriate by ethnic affiliation and by type of economy sample unit village in rural area house in city be draw systematically within these stratum 3 size of the sample different sample ratio be apply under different condition high proportion be sample in urban and mix community than in rural area about 11 percent of the total population be cover in the new investigation a compare with about 3 percent in the previous inquiry 4 question and definition uniform question definition and procedure be enforce throughout the whole country data be obtain separately on three class of person a resident present b resident absent and c visitor in the report summary result be give for both the de facto a and c and de jure a and b population but the subsequent analysis of characteristic be report only for the de jure population or in some district only the de facto population these change represent in effect a shift from 1 an administrative compilation of data obtain through procedure design primarily to serve political and economic objective to 2 a systematic sample census of the whole african population the population registration system still have important function it supply local data which be useful in administration and which can be use a a basis for intensive study in particular situation it provide a frame for the sample census it also provide a frame within which the registration of vital event be gradually gain force though one can not expect to obtain reliable vital statistics in most part of the congo from this source in the near future it be still use in make current population estimate in post-census year though the value of these estimate be open to question finally it may have certain very important less obvious value even though the register may have an incomplete record of person present in a particular area or include person no long live there they contain precise information on age by date of birth for some of the person present especially child in relatively stable community and supplementary information such a record of marital status for many other the quality of the census data can therefore be greatly improve by the use of the registration record in conjunction with the field inquiry furthermore it may be possible to estimate the error due to bias in method a distinguish from sample error in each of these source on such subject a fertility mortality and migration during a give interval by use information from two largely independent source in conjunction the first sample census in the congo extend over a three-year period 1955 - 57 the result be still be process in 1959 it be plan to double the number of team and to make use of improve equipment in a second demographic inquiry in 1960 so that the inquiry can be carry through in one year and the result publish more expeditiously it be propose that in the future complete sample census be carry out at five-year interval report already issue on the sample census 1955 - 57 in various area run a follow use only the french and omit correspond flemish title this report contain preliminary note and 35 table other report in identical form but with somewhat vary content have be issue these area report will be follow accord to present plan by a summary report which will include a detail statement on method
