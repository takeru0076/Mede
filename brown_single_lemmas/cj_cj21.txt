introduction in 1 we investigate a new series of line involutions in a projective space of three dimension over the field of complex number these be define by a simple involutorial transformation of the point in which a general line meet a nonsingular quadric surface bear a curve of symbol afj then in 2 we show that any line involution with the property that a it have no complex of invariant line and b it singular line form a complex consist exclusively of the line which meet a twist curve be necessarily of the type discuss in 1 no generalization of these result to space of more than three dimension have so far be find possible 1 let q be a nonsingular quadric surface bear reguli afj and afj and let \*\* zg be a afj curve of order k on q a general line l meet q in two point afj and afj through each of which pass a unique generator of the regulus afj whose line be simple secant of afj on these generator let afj and afj be respectively the harmonic conjugate of afj and afj with respect to the two point in which the correspond generator meet afj the line afj be the image of l clearly the transformation be involutorial we observe first that no line l can meet it image except at one of it intersection with q for if it do the plane of l and l would contain two generator of afj which be impossible moreover from the definitive transformation of intercept on the generator of afj it be clear that the only point of q at which a line can meet it image be the point of afj hence the totality of singular line be the t order complex of line which meet afj the invariant line be the line of the congruence of secant of \*\* zg since each of these meet q in two point which be invariant the order of this congruence be afj since afj secant of a curve of symbol b on a quadric surface pass through an arbitrary point the class of the congruence be afj since an arbitrary plane meet \*\* zg in k point since the complex of singular line be of order k and since there be no complex of invariant line it follow from the formula afj that the order of the involution be afj there be various set of exceptional line or line whose image be not unique the most obvious of these be the quadratic complex of tangent to q each line of which be transform into the entire pencil of line tangent to q at the image of the point of tangency of the give line thus pencil of tangent to q be transform into pencil of tangent it be interest that a 1 1 correspondence can be establish between the line of two such pencil so that in a sense a unique image can actually be assign to each tangent for the line of any plane \*\* yp meet q in a conic c be transform into the congruence of secant of the curve c into which c be transform in the point involution on q in particular tangent to c be transform into tangent to c moreover if afj and afj be two plane intersect in a line l tangent to q at a point p the two free intersection of the image curve afj and afj must coincide at p the image of p and at this point afj and afj must have a common tangent l hence think of a a line in a particular plane \*\* yp any tangent to q have a unique image and moreover this image be the same for all plane through l each generator \*\* yl of afj be also exceptional for each be transform into the entire congruence of secant of the curve into which that generator be transform by the point involution on q this curve be of symbol afj since it meet \*\* yl and hence every line of afj in the afj invariant point on \*\* yl and since it obviously meet every line of afj in a single point the congruence of it secant be therefore of order afj and class afj a final class of exceptional line be identifiable from the follow consideration since no two generator of afj can intersect it follow that they image curve can have no free intersection in other word these curve have only fix intersection common to they all now the only way in which all curve of the image family of afj can pass through a fix point be to have a generator of afj which be not a secant but a tangent of \*\* zg for then any point on such a generator will be transform into the point of tangency since two curve of symbol afj on q intersect in afj point it follow that there be afj line of afj which be tangent to afj clearly any line l of any bundle have one of these point of tangency t a vertex will be transform into the entire pencil have the image of the second intersection of l and q a vertex and lie in the plane determine by the image point and the generator of afj which be tangent to \*\* zg at t a line through two of these point afj and afj will be transform into the entire bilinear congruence have the tangent to \*\* zg at afj and afj a directrices a conic c be a 1 1 curve on q meet the image of any line of afj which we have already find to be a afj curve on q in afj point hence it image c meet any line of afj in afj point moreover c obviously meet any line afj in a single point hence c be a afj curve on q therefore the congruence of it secant that be the image of a general plane field of line be of order afj and class afj finally the image of a general bundle of line be a congruence whose order be the order of the congruence of invariant line namely afj and whose class be the order of the image congruence of a general plane field of line namely af 2 the precede observation make it clear that there exist line involutions of all order great than 1 with no complex of invariant line and with a complex of singular line consist exclusively of the line which meet a twist curve afj we now shall show that any involution with these characteristic be necessarily of the type we have just describe to do this we must first show that every line which meet \*\* zg in a point p meet it image at p to see this consider a general pencil of line contain a general secant of afj by 1 the image of this pencil be a rule surface of order afj which be meet by the plane of the pencil in a curve c of order afj on c there be a afj correspondence in which the afj point cut from c by a general line l of the pencil correspond to the point of intersection of the image of l and the plane of the pencil since c be rational this correspondence have k coincidence each of which imply a line of the pencil which meet it image however since the pencil contain a secant of \*\* zg it actually contain only afj singular line to avoid this contradiction it be necessary that c be composite with the secant of \*\* zg and a curve of order afj a component thus it follow that the secant of \*\* zg be all invariant but if this be the case then an arbitrary pencil of line have a point p of \*\* zg a vertex be transform into a rule surface of order afj have afj generator concurrent at p since a rule surface of order n with n concurrent generator be necessarily a cone it follow finally that every line through a point p of \*\* zg meet it image at p a assert now consider the transformation of the line of a bundle with vertex p on \*\* zg which be effect by the involution a a whole from the precede remark it be clear that such a bundle be transform into itself in an involutorial fashion moreover in this involution there be a cone of invariant line of order afj namely the cone of secant of \*\* zg which pass through p hence it follow that the involution within the bundle must be a perspective de jonquieres involution of order afj and the invariant locus must have a multiple line of multiplicity either afj or afj the first possibility require that there be a line through p which meet \*\* zg in afj point the second require that there be a line through p which meet \*\* zg in afj point in each case line of the bundle be transform by involutions within the pencil they determine with the multiple secant in the first case the fix element within each pencil be the multiple secant and the line join the vertex p to the intersection of \*\* zg and the plane of the pencil which do not lie on the multiple secant in the second the fix element be the line which join the vertex p to the two intersection of \*\* zg and the plane of the pencil which do not lie on the multiple secant the multiple secant of course be exceptional and in each case be transform into cone of order afj observation similar to these can be make at each point of afj hence \*\* zg must have either a regulus of af-fold secant or a regulus of af-fold secant moreover if afj no two of the multiple secant can intersect for if such be the case either the plane of the two line would meet \*\* zg in more than k point or alternatively the order of the image regulus of the pencil determine by the two line would be too high but if no two line of the regulus of multiple secant of \*\* zg can intersect then the regulus must be quadratic or in other word \*\* zg must be either a afj or a afj curve on a nonsingular quadric surface we now observe that the case in which \*\* zg be a afj curve on a quadric be impossible if the complex of singular line consist exclusively of the line which meet afj for any pencil in a plane contain a af-fold secant of \*\* zg have an image regulus which meet the plane of the pencil in afj line namely the image of the line of the pencil which pass through the intersection of \*\* zg and the multiple secant plus an additional component to account for the intersection of the image of the general line of the pencil however if there be no additional complex of singular line the order of the image regulus of a pencil be precisely afj this contradict the precede observation and so under the assumption of this paper we must reject the possibility that \*\* zg be a afj curve on a quadric surface continue with the case in which \*\* zg be a afj curve on a quadric q we first observe that the second regulus of q consist precisely of the line which join the two free intersection of \*\* zg and the plane through any one of the multiple secant for each of these line meet q in three point namely two point on \*\* zg and one point on one of the multiple secant now consider an arbitrary line l meet q in two point afj and afj if \*\* you be the multiple secant of \*\* zg which pass through afj and \*\* yb be the simple secant of \*\* zg which pass through afj and if afj be the point in which \*\* you meet \*\* zg and if afj be the image of afj on the generator \*\* yb it follow that the image of the line afj be afj
