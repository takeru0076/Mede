how else can one explain for example allow the survival of the right to amortize bond discount and premium section 381 c 9 but not the right to amortize bond issue expense or allow a deduction for payment of certain obligation of a transferor assume in the reorganization section 381 c 16 but not a deduction for theft loss sustain by a transferor prior to a reorganization but discover after it or require a transferor to carry over it method of depreciation section 381 c 6 but not allow rapid amortization of emergency facility transfer in a reorganization or allow survival of a dividend carryover to a personal hold company section 381 c 14 but not carryover of excess tax credit for foreign tax these item and most of the other list above seem quite comparable to item whose right of survival be provide for in section 381 there do not seem to be any reasonable basis for distinction either in term of the nature of the tax attribute or in term of tax-avoidance possibility with respect to item such a these the provision of section 381 c view in historical perspective suggest a rule require survival whether the item be beneficial or detrimental to the survive corporation to this extent some stretch of the literal mean of the committee report seem justify since the literal mean conflict with the clear implication if not the language of the statute it be not contend that section 381 should prescribe the survival of all of the transferor s tax attribute such an interpretation could not be justify by a construction of the statute alone it would certainly violate the intention of congress a express in the committee report and in at least one instance involve refund claim it might be contrary to another provision of the unite state code refund claim section 203 of the unite state code void an assignment of a claim against the government unless make after it have be allow the amount due have be ascertain and a warrant for it payment have be issue if it be not for judicial development of certain exception this section would prohibit a suit for refund by an acquire corporation for tax pay by a transferor corporation even though the reorganization meet the requirement of section 381 a a clearly recognize exception be a statutory merger or consolidation the lead case seaboard air line railway v unite state hold that the transferee could sue for a refund of tax pay by the transferor and it have be consistently follow the court say the purpose of the section be principally to spare the government the embarrassment and trouble of deal with several party one of they a strange to the claim and to prevent traffic in claim particularly tenuous claim against the government neither reason say the court apply to the case at hand furthermore congress could not be presume to have intend to obstruct merger approve by the state other exception be assignment for the benefit of creditor corporate dissolution transfer by descent or transfer by subrogation exception be often classify a transfer by operation of law a tax-free reorganization not comply with the merger or consolidation statute of the state involve be difficult to fit into an operation of law mold although it be in some way comparable to a voluntary sale of asset for cash to which section 203 quite clearly apply the court and treasury have hold that acquire corporation in several type of non-taxable reorganization may sue for refund of tax pay by transferors a recent case in point be mitchell cannery v unite state in which a claim against the government be transfer first from a corporation to a partnership whose partner be former stockholder and then to another corporation form by the partner hold the final corporation entitle to sue on the claim the court cite the seaboard novo trade and roomberg case for the proposition that transfer by operation of law or in conjunction with change of corporate structure be not assignment prohibit by the statute in an early case kingan & co v unite state an american corporation be form for the purpose of acquire the stock of a british corporation in exchange for it own stock and then liquidate the british corporation the anti-assignment statute be hold not to prevent the american corporation from sue for a refund of tax pay by the british corporation the transaction presumably would have qualify under section 368 a 1 a a contractual reorganization follow by a section 332 liquidation but not under section 368 a 1 a a statutory merger of consolidation the court nevertheless rely on the seaboard case and also mention that the shareholder of the two corporation be the same in substance say the court there be no transfer of equitable title the treasury arrive at substantially the same conclusion but skirt the problem of section 203 of the unite state code revenue rule 54-17 provide that if the corporation against which a tax be assess have since be liquidate by merger with a successor corporation a claim for refund should be file by the successor in the name and on behalf of the corporation which pay the tax follow by the name of the successor corporation proper evidence of the liquidation and succession must also be file if the succession be a matter of public record certificate of the secretary of state or other public official have custody of the document will suffice if the succession be not of record all document relate to such succession properly certify be require the former proof seem applicable to a statutory merger or consolidation the latter to a contractual acquisition the rule would not however apply to an acquisition of asset for cash a recent rule although rather confuse cite and follow rev rul 54-17 the rule suggest also that it apply to either a statutory or contractual reorganization hence a successor corporation in a c reorganization appear entitle to sue for a refund of tax pay by the merge corporation despite section 203 in a b reorganization follow by a section 332 liquidation those case which hold that section 203 be inapplicable to transfer in liquidation appear to permit the successor corporation to sue for refund of tax pay by the transferor in fact a cash purchase of a corporation s stock follow by liquidation might also be an effective way to transfer a claim for refund if the kimbell-diamond doctrine be not apply to eliminate the intermediate step these result appear sound a state in seaboard and numerous other case the two primary reason for the enactment of section 203 of the unite state code be to prevent the government from have to deal with more than one claimant and to prevent the assignment of meretricious claim on a contingent-fee basis the case have allow transfer of claim if beneficial ownership be not change the first reason would never apply to a reorganization transfer which meet the condition of section 381 a which be the only type presently under discussion section 381 a apply only to a transfer by liquidation of a subsidiary own to the extent of at least 80 per cent a statutory merger or consolidation an acquisition of substantially all a corporation s asset solely in exchange for vote stock or a change of identity form or place of organization in virtually every case the transferor corporation be liquidate and it former stockholder either own outright or have a continue stock interest in the asset which give rise to the tax in these circumstance the possibility of multiple or conflict claim be exceedingly remote furthermore in a c reorganization the continue interest of stockholder of the corporation which pay the tax must be great than be necessary in a statutory merger to which the statute be clearly inapplicable nor be it at all likely that a desperate claim against the government will be assign on a contingent-fee basis in the guise of a tax-free reorganization if the transferor have substantial asset other than the claim it seem reasonable to assume no corporation would be will to acquire all of it property in the dim hope of collect a claim for refund of tax if such an unlikely transaction be to take place it would more logically be accomplish by a stock purchase follow by the prosecution of the claim by the wholly-owned subsidiary follow by liquidation in the rare case where a corporation s only substantial asset or it most important one be a claim for refund perhaps it transfer should not be permit whether the reorganization take the form of a statutory merger or of the acquisition of asset for stock it appear then that although the matter be not deal with in section 381 c a successor corporation in a reorganization of a type specify in section 381 a be entitle to sue for refund of tax pay by a transferor corporation section 203 of the unite state code have be interpret a not apply to claim against the government transfer in tax-free reorganization the successor corporation have be hold entitle to sue on such claim other tax attribute of the transferor there be certain tax attribute of a corporation whose nature and effect might depend on the fact of the particular reorganization involve for example property use in the trade or business of a transferor corporation a define in section 1231 presumably would not retain it special status follow a non-taxable reorganization if it be not so use in the business of the acquire corporation the parent of a group file consolidate return might be treat a the same corporation follow a reorganization define in section 368 a 1 but a a different corporation for this purpose after a tax-free acquisition by another corporation which have not for example elect to file consolidate return with it own subsidiary similar consideration presumably make it difficult to prescribe a general rule where the acquire and acquire corporation have different method of account section 381 c 4 or depreciation section 381 c 6 other section of the 1954 internal revenue code provide for survival of certain of a transferor s tax attribute follow a tax-free reorganization section 362 require carryover of the transferor corporation s basis for property transfer and section 1223 provide for tack on the transferor s hold period for such property to that of the transferee section 169 permit a person acquire grain-storage facility to elect to continue amortization over a 60-month period however a similar privilege be not specifically provide in section 168 for a person acquire emergency facility attribute similar to a loss carryover there may be certain item which be quite similar to a net operate loss carryover or operate deficit and whose right to survive a reorganization should perhaps be subject to the condition applicable to those item for example suppose another excess profit tax similar to prior law be enact provide for carryover of excess profit credit this carryover right have a number of thing in common with a net operate loss carryover it be an average device intend to ease the tax burden of fluctuate income it be a tax benefit which might be of substantial value to a corporation which expect to have a high excess profit tax under the 1939 code this item be permit to survive a tax-free reorganization in the stanton brewery case but only over the dissent of judge learn hand who write the majority opinion in the sansome case a lead case require carryover of earnings and profit in a non-taxable reorganization since this type of item be not in the statute when section 381 be enact in 1954 one can not say with certainty what effect the enactment of that section should have with respect to this type of item one might properly apply the language of the committee report quote above which caution against use section 381 a a basis for treat other tax attribute not mention therein actually there do not presently appear to be item in the statute comparable to a net operate loss carryover probably the primary reason for special treatment of a net operate loss carryover be the unique opportunity it present for tax avoidance
