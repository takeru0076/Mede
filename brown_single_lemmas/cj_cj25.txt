sentiment tension management and communication of sentiment be the process involve in the function of the element of sentiment or feel one of the device for tension management be preferential mate the preferential mate of this particular population have be analyze in a separate study the relative geographical isolation of the brandywine population make for a limit choice in mate it would seem necessary that member of this population provide support for one another since it be not provide by the large society the supportive relation can apparently be achieve in geographical and social isolation the newlywed build home on the same land with either set of parent and the almost exclusive use of member of the population a sponsor for baptism and wedding illustrate this supportive relationship a loomis remark in the internal pattern the chief reason for interact be to communicate like friendship and love among those who stand in support relation to one another and correspond negative sentiment to those who stand in antagonistic relation achieve maintenance of the status quo might seem to be the appropriate goal or objective of this population today yet the object of the element of achieve through the process of goal attain for this population appear to have be change by circumstance bring about by the war prior to world war 2 there be a high percentage of endogamous marriage than after world war 2 norm the norm a element refer to all criterion for judge the character or conduct of both individual and group action in any social system the process of evaluation assign vary positive and negative priority or value to element the element and process become evident in a study of mate selection in this population from the evidence it may be conjecture that core - core marriage be the prefer union for core male and female core - marginal marriage still belong in the category of permissive union and core - negro marriage be proscribe for core member status-roles the element of status-roles and associate process have not be sufficiently investigate for this population to permit any type of conjecture about they power there be some indication from a limit number of interview with member of the population that the element of power primarily the voluntary influence of non-authoritative power have be exert on actor in the system particularly in regard to mate selection this would seem to vary from family to family depend somewhat on the core or marginal status of that family again size of the group may have some influence on the strength of group control rank interview with member of the brandywine population be attempt in order to discover the rank of the various family in the population the large majority of the interviewee place core family in the upper position loomis consider rank a product of the evaluation process the stand or rank of an actor in a give social system be determine by the evaluation place upon the actor and he act in accordance with the norm and standard of the system despite the increase rate of exogamous marriage the population have be able to sustain at least to some degree the consciousness of it intermediate status in society to some extent the system can be consider a gemeinschaft in which social-role occupancy be determine by birth by attribute such a sex or caste which be biologically or socially immutable the adherence of many in the population to the indian background in they pedigree and emphasis upon the fact that they ancestor have never be slave become of prime interest in determine how far these element promote the self-image of the intermediate status of the group in society sanction the negative sanction apply to core - negro marriage for core member act a indicator of expect adherence to group norm however because of church law lately more stringently enforce which forbid the marriage of cousin closely relate consanguineously a mean of facilitate the goal of in-group relation may be that of recourse to illegitimate union a cursory survey of available material indicate a high rate of illegitimate birth occur to parent who have a close consanguineous relationship subsystem the comprehensive or master process activate all or some of the element within the social system and subsystem within the large social system be the structural and functional subsystem the structural subsystem consist of relatively stable inter-relationship among it part include 1 subgroup of various type interconnect by relational norm 2 role of various type within the large system and within the subgroup 3 regulative norm govern subgroup and role 4 cultural value in the study of marriage pattern for this group consanguinity produce the structural system a system of affinity which in turn maintain the system of consanguinity subgroup of various type have be find within this system each family line can be consider a substructure there seem to be an imply cultural value attach to the fact of core status within the group additionally the proscription of core - negro marriage for core family discuss above would seem to act a a regulative norm govern subgroup and role the scope of this study do not provide for the study of role of various type within the large system or within the subgroup however it can not be presume informal though the structure of the population seem that there be not well-defined role within the system the present study relate to the theory of functional system it be hypothesize that fertility be a function of the social system when the population a a whole be consider and a function of the subsystem when the two-fold division of core family and marginal family be consider the four functional problem of a social system be to some extent solve by the subsystem within this population by mean of geographical isolation and high fertility rate inbreeding can be foster and the pattern of isolation from the great society maintain in order to attain the goal of group solidarity and to relieve tension the high fertility rate provide more group member for mate selection and the cluster of member in group foster acceptance of group control to maintain they intermediate position in the large society it be not only necessary that member of this population be visible but that they number be great enough to be recognize a a separate distinct group or system in society a mention above where family be concentrate in large number group control seem strong and most effective adaptation to the social and non-social environment through the economy have be meet to a degree through a type of occupational segregation this provide the necessary contact with the large society while support a type of control over member in term of social contact integration have to do with the inter-relation of part the problem of solidarity and morale again involve the concept of value the value place by the brandywine population upon maintain a certain homogeneity a certain separate racial identity and therefore a certain separate social status be important for the morale of the system since morale be closely relate to pattern maintenance and integration the high the morale and solidarity the good the system can solve the problem of the system in this respect it would seem that the great the social distance between the brandywine population and the white and negro population within the same general locality the great the possibility for high morale and solidarity within the brandywine population it be conceive that one of the mean to attain this social distance be that of physical and social isolation in turn high fertility rate for this population provide a mean of increase the numerical quantity of the population allow for the possibility of great stability and unity the population can thereby replenish itself and actually grow large master process of particular utility in the analysis of the development persistence and change of social system have be the use of the master or comprehensive process loomis consider six such process in he paradigm 1 communication 2 boundary maintenance 3 systemic linkage 4 socialization 5 social control 6 institutionalization though undoubtedly all six process be operative within the whole social system and it subsystem two process that be of crucial importance to this study will be single out for particular emphasis communication in discuss the process of communication loomis define it a the process by which information decision and directive be transmit among actor and the way in which knowledge opinion and attitude be form or modify by interaction communication may be facilitate by mean of the high visibility within the large community intense interaction be easy where segregate live and occupational segregation mark off a group from the rest of the community a in the case of this population however the factor of physical isolation be not a static situation although the brandywine population be still predominantly rural there be indication of a consistent and a statistically significant trend away from the old and relatively isolate rural community urbanization appear to be an important factor in the disintegration of this group this conclusion be however an over-simplification a more realistic analysis must take into account the fact that brandywine people in the urban-fringe area be in general less segregate locally than group member in rural area in the urban area in other word they unlike some urban ethnic group do not concentrate in ghetto colony group pressure toward conformity be slight or non-existent and deviant behavior in mate selection incur few if any social sanction in such a set social contact and association be likely to be heterogamous result in a change of value and almost necessarily in mate selection behavior to the extent that urban life contribute to the breakdown of the group pattern of residential isolation to that extent it contribute directly to increase exogamy social control the process of social control be operative insofar a sanction play a part in the individual s behavior a well a the group s behavior by mean of this social control deviance be either eliminate or somehow make compatible with the function of the social group example from this population indicate that deviance seem to be sanction by ostracism from the group socialization there be an oral tradition among the member of the population in regard to the origin and subsequent separate status of the group in the large society confuse and divide though this tradition may be it be an important part of the social and cultural heritage of the group and act a a mean of socialization particularly for member of the rural community the fact of indian ancestry and free status during the day of slavery be important distinction make by member of the group boundary maintenance culturally induce social cohesion result from common norm and value internalize by member of the group be operative in the boundary maintenance of the group a well a in the process of socialization the process of boundary maintenance identify and preserve the social system or subsystem and the characteristic interaction be maintain a the threat of encroachment on the system increase the probability of apply boundary maintenance mechanism increase the fertility rate pattern would seem to be a function though a latent one of the process of maintain the boundary increase boundary maintenance may be achieve for example by assign a high primacy or evaluation to activity characteristic of the external pattern the external pattern or external system can be consider a group behavior that enable the group to survive in it environment boundary maintenance for this group would seem to be primarily social a be the preference for endogamy it be also express in the proscription against deviant in the matter of endogamy particularly in rural area by they pattern of endogamy and exogamy the core family and the marginal family show distinct limit to the intergroup contact they maintain systemic linkage where boundary maintenance describe the boundary or limit of the group systemic linkage be define a the process whereby one or more of the element of at least two social system be articulate in such a manner that the two system in some way and on some occasion may be view a a single unit
