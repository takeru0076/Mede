in ireland s county limerick near the river shannon there be a quiet little suburb by the name of garryowen which mean garden of owen undoubtedly none of the resident realize the influence they town have have on american military history or the deed of valor that have be do in it name the cry garryowen burst from the lip of a charge cavalry trooper be the last sound hear on this earth by untold number of cheyennes sioux and apaches mexican banditos under pancho villa japanese in the south pacific and chinese and north korean communist in korea garryowen be the battle cry of the 7th we cavalry regiment the fight seventh today a battle cry may seem an anachronism for in the modern army esprit de corps have be sacrifice to organizational chart and table but do nt tell that to a veteran of the fight seventh especially in a saloon on saturday night of all the thousands of man who have serve in the 7th cav perhaps no one know it spirit good than lieutenant colonel melbourne c chandler wiry and burr-headed with steel blue eye and a chest splatter with medal chandler be the epitome of the old-time trooper the truth be however that when mel chandler first report to the regiment the only steed he have ever ride be a swivel chair and the only weapon he have ever wield be a pencil chandler have be commission in the medical service corps and be serve a a personnel officer for the kansas city medical depot when he decide that if he be go to make the army he career he want to be in the fight part of it though he know no more about military science and tactic than any other desk officer he manage to get transfer to the combat force the next thing he know he be report for duty a command officer of troop h 7th cavalry in the middle of corps maneuver in japan outside of combat he could nt have land in a tough spot first of all no unit like to have a new co bring in from the outside especially when he s an armchair trooper second if there be ever a perfect time to pull the rug out from under he it s on maneuver in combat help you co make a fool of himself might mean get yourself kill but in maneuver with the top brass watch he all the time it s easy chandler understand this and expect the bad but he first few day with troop h be full of surprise begin with first sergeant robert early chandler have expect a tough old trooper with a gravel voice instead sergeant early be quiet sharp and confident he have enlist in the army straight out of high school and have immediately set about learn he new trade there be no weapon early could not take apart and reassemble blind-folded he could lead a patrol and he know he paper work far he have take full advantage of the army s correspondence course he not only know soldier but mathematics history and literature a well but for all he erudite confidence sergeant early be right out of the garryowen mold he be fill with the spirit of the fight seventh that save mel chandler sergeant early let the new co know just how lucky he be to be in the good troop in the good regiment in the unite state army he feed the captain bit of history about the troop and the regiment for example it be a battalion of the 7th cavalry under colonel george armstrong custer that have be wipe out at the battle of the little big horn it do nt take captain chandler long to realize that he have to carry a heavy load of tradition on he shoulder a commander of troop afj but what make the load light be the realization that every officer non-com and trooper be ready and will to help he carry it for the good of the troop and the regiment maneuver over the 7th return to garrison duty in tokyo captain chandler still with they it be the 7th cavalry whose trooper be charge with guard the imperial palace of the emperor but still mel chandler be not completely convince that man would really die for a four-syllable word garryowen the final proof be a small incident it happen at the st patrick s day party a big affair for a regiment which have go into battle for over three-quarter of a century to the strain of an irish march in the middle of the party chandler look up to see four smile face bear down upon he each beam above the big green shamrock he have ever see the face belong to lieutenant marvin gould he wife and they two child and when the sing begin it be the gouldings who sing the old irish song the good though there be an occasional good-natured chuckle about marvin gould the jewish officer from chicago sing tearfully about the ould sod no one really think it be strange for marvin gould like giovanni martini the bugler boy who carry custer s last message or margarito lopez the one-man army on leyte be a garryowen through and through it be no coincidence that gould be one of the most beloved platoon leader in the regiment and so mel chandler get the spirit of garryowen he set out to keep troop h the good troop in the good regiment one of he innovation be to see to it that every man cook and clerk a well a rifleman qualify with every weapon in the troop even the mess sergeant bill word a dapper cocky transfer from an airborne division go out on the range the troop receive a new leader lieutenant robert m carroll fresh out of rotc and buck for regular army status carroll be sharp and military but he be up against tough competition for that ra berth and he want to play it cool so mel chandler set out to sell he on the spirit of garryowen just a he himself have be sell a short time before when the korean war begin on june 25 1950 the anniversary of the day custer have go down fight at the little big horn and the day the regiment have assault the beachhead of leyte during world war 2 the 7th cavalry be not in the good fight condition it entire complement of non-commissioned officer on the platoon level have depart a cadre for another unit and it vehicle be still those use in the drive across luzon in world war 2 just a month after the korean war break out the 7th cavalry be move into the line ready for combat from then on the fight seventh be in the thick of the bittere fight in korea one night on the naktong river mel chandler call on that fabled esprit de corps the regiment be dig in on the east side of the river and the north korean be steadily build up a concentration of crack troop on the other side the trooper know an attack be come but they do nt know when and they do nt know where at 6 oclock on the morning of august 12 they be in doubt no long then it come against troop afj the enemy have filter across the river during the night and a full force of 1000 man arm with russian machine gun attack the position hold by chandler s man they come in wave first come the cannon fodder white-clad civilian be drive into death a a massive human batter ram they be follow by crack north korean troop who mount one charge after another they overran the 7th cav s forward machine-gun position through sheer weight of number over pile of they own dead another force flank the company and take up a position on a hill to the rear captain chandler see that it be build up strength he assemble a group of 25 man compose of wound trooper await evacuation the company clerk supply man cook and driver and lead they to the hill one of the more seriously wound be lieutenant carroll the young officer buck for the regular army chandler leave carroll at the bottom of the hill to direct any reinforcement he could find to the fight then mel chandler start up the hill he take one step two break into a trot and then into a run the first thing he know the word garryowen burst from he throat he follower shout the old battle cry after he and charge the hill fire a they run the korean fall back but regroup at the top of the hill and pin down the cavalryman with a screen of fire chandler look to right and leave to see how he man be fare suddenly see another figure bound up the hill hurl grenade and holler the battle cry a he run it be bob carroll who have suddenly find himself imbue with the spirit of garryowen he have form he own task force of three straggler and lead they up the hill in a fight seventh charge because of this diversionary attack the main group that have be pin down on the hill be able to surge forward again but an enemy grenade hit carroll in the head and detonate simultaneously he go down like a wet rag and the attacker hit the dirt in the face of the wither enemy fire enemy reinforcement come pour down seek a soft spot they find it at the junction between troop h and g and prepare to counterattack marvin gould see what be happen he turn to he platoon okay man he say follow i gould leap to he foot and start forward garryowen on he lip he man follow but the bullet whack home before he finish he battle cry and marvin gould fall dead for an instant he man hesitate unable to believe that they lieutenant the most popular officer in the regiment be dead then they let out a bellow of anguish and rage and curse scream and holler garryowen they charge into the enemy like wild man that finish the job that captain chandler and lieutenant carroll have begin gould s platoon push back the enemy soldier and break up the time of the entire enemy attack reinforcement come up quickly to take advantage of the open make by gould s platoon the north korean throw away they gun and flee across the rice paddy artillery and air strike be call in to kill they by the hundreds though bob carroll seem to have have he head practically blow off by the explode grenade he live today he be a major in the regular army so fill be mel chandler with the spirit of garryowen that after korea be over he take on the job of write the complete history of the regiment after year of dig night and weekend he put together the big profusely illustrate book of garryowen and glory which be probably the most complete history of any military unit the battle of the naktong river be just one example of how the battle cry and the spirit of the fight seventh have pay off for nearly a century the cry have never fail to rally the fight man of the regiment take the case of major marcus a reno who survive the battle of the little big horn in 1876 from the enlist man he pistol-whipped to the subordinate officer whose wife he try to rape a lot of man have plenty of reason heartily to dislike marcus reno many of he fellow officer refuse to speak to he but when a board of inquiry be call to look into the charge of cowardice make against he the man who have see reno leave the battlefield and the officer who have hear reno suggest that the wound be leave to be torture by the sioux refuse to say a harsh word against he he be a member of the fight seventh although it be at the battle of the little horn about which more word have be write than any other battle in american history that the 7th cavalry first make it mark in history the regiment be ten year old by then brevet major general george armstrong custer be the regiment s first permanent commander and like such general a george s patton and terry de la mesa allen in they rise to military prominence custer be a believer in blood and guts warfare
