all of which bring up another problem in the use of psychoanalytic insight in a literary work be the oedipus complex the clinical syndrome material for a tragedy if we remove ourselves for a moment from we time and we infatuation with mental disease be nt there something absurd about a hero in a novel who be defeat by he infantile neurosis i be not make a clinical judgment here for such personal tragedy be real and be commonplace in the analyst s consult room but literature make a different claim upon we sympathy than tragedy in life a man in a novel who be defeat in he childhood and condemn by unconscious force within he to tiredly repeat he early failure in love only make we a little weary of man he tragedy seem unworthy and trivial now we can argue that the irresistible fate of oedipus rex be nothing more than the irresistible unconscious longing of oedipus project outward but this externalization of unconscious conflict make all the difference between a story and a clinical case history we can also argue that the three brother karamazov and smerdyakov be the external representative of an internal conflict within one man dostoevsky a conflict have to do with father-murder and the wish to possess the father s woman but a novel in which one man karamazov explore the division within he personality would scarcely merit publication in the psychoanalytic quarterly it be a mistake to look upon the oedipus of oedipus complex a a literary descendant of oedipus rex whatever the psychological truth in the oedipus myth an oedipus who be draw to he fate by irresistible external force can carry the symbol of humanity and it archaic crime and the incest that be unknowing renew the mystery of the eternal dream of childhood and absorb we in the secret but a modern oedipus who be doom because he can not oppose he own childhood be only pathetic and for renounce the mystery in favor of psychological truth he give up the claim on we sympathy i be suggest that a case-history approach to the oedipus complex be a blind alley for a storyteller the good gift of the novelist will be waste on the reader who be insulate against any surprise the novelist may have in store for he incest be still a durable theme but if it want to get write about it will have to find way to surprise the emotion and there be no good way to do this than that of concealment and symbolic representation and the good way to conceal and disguise the element of an incest story be not to set out to write an incest story which bring to mind another lawrence story and some interest comparison in the treatment of the oedipal theme the rock horse winner be also a story about a boy s love for he mother if i now risk some comparison with son and lover let it be clear that i be not compare the two work or judge they merit i be only single out difference in treatment of a theme and the resultant effect the rock horse winner be a fantasy with extraordinary power to disturb the reader but we do not know why it be the story of the hopeless love of a little boy for he cold and vain mother there be ghostly scene in which the little boy on he rock horse rock madly toward the climax that will magically give he the name of the win horse the child grow rich on he winning and conspire with he uncle to make secret gift of he money to he mother the story end in the child s illness and delirium bring on by the feverish compulsion to ride he horse to win for he mother the child die with he mourn mother at he bedside i have read the story many time without ask myself why it affect i or care why it do but on one occasion when i encounter a similar fantasy in a little boy who be i patient i begin to understand the uncanny effect of this story it be of course a little boy s fantasy of win he mother to himself and replace the father who could not give she the thing she want a classical oedipal fantasy if you like but if it be only this the story would be banal why do the story affect we how do the rock exert it uncanny effect upon the reader the rock be actually feel in the story a terrible and ominous rhythm that prophesy the tragedy the rock i realize be the single element in the story that carry the erotic message the unspoken and unconscious undercurrent that would mar the innocence of a child s fantasy and disturb the effect of the work if it be make explicit the rock have the ambiguous function of keep the erotic undercurrent silent and make it present it conceal and yet be suggestive a perfect symbol and if we understand the rock a an erotic symbol we can also see how well it serve a the symbol of impending tragedy for this love of the boy for he mother be a hopeless and forbid love doom by it nature we be also strike by the fact that this story of a boy s love for he mother do not offend while the incestuous love of the man paul morel sometimes repel it s easy to see why this love belong to childhood we accord it it place there and in lawrence s treatment we be give the innocent fantasy of a child in fact the form in which oedipal love be express in childhood and when the child die in lawrence s story in a delirium that be somehow bring on by he mania to win and to make he mother rich the manifest absurdity of such a disease and such a death do not enter into we thought at all we have so completely enter the child s fantasy that he illness and he death be the plausible and the necessary conclusion i be sure that none of the effect of this story be consciously employ by lawrence to describe an oedipal fantasy in childhood it be most probable that freud and the oedipus complex never enter he head in the write of this story he be simply write a story that want to be tell and in the write a childhood fantasy of he own emerge he would not have care why it emerge he only want to capture a memory to play with it again in he imagination and somehow to fix and hold in the story the disturb emotion that accompany the fantasy in we own time we have see that the novelist s debt to psychoanalysis have increase but that the novel itself have not profit much from this marriage ortega s hope that modern psychology might yet bring forth a last flower of the novel have only be partially fulfil the young writer seem intimidate by psychological knowledge he have lose confidence in he own eye and in the validity of he own psychological insight he borrow the insight of psychology to improve he impair vision but can not bring to he work the distinctive vision that should be a novelist s own he have be seduce by the marvel of the unconscious and have lose interest in study the surface of character if many of the character in contemporary novel appear to be the bloodless relation of character in a case history it be because the novelist be often forgetful today that those thing that we call character manifest themselves in surface behavior that the ego be still the executive agency of personality and that all we know of personality must be discern through the ego the novelist who have be badly baptize in psychoanalysis often give we the impression that since all man must have an oedipus complex all man must have the same face 2 i have argue that oedipus of the oedipus complex have a doubtful future a a tragic figure in literature but a writer who have a taste for irony and who see incest in all it modern dimension can let he imagination work on the disturb joke in the incest myth the joke that strike right at the center of man s humanness moral dread be see a the other face of desire and here psychoanalysis deliver to the writer a magnificent irony and a moral problem of great complexity there be probably some significance in the fact that two of the good incest story i have encounter in recent year be burlesque of the incest myth the ancient type be reassemble in gloom and foreboding to be irresistibly draw to they destiny but the myth fail before the modern truth the oracle speak false and the dream speak true in both the farmer s tale in ralph ellison s invisible man and in thoma mann s the holy sinner the incest hero rise above the myth by accept the wish a motive the heroic act be the cast off of pretense thoma mann write the holy sinner in 1951 it be conceive a a leave-taking a kind of melancholy gathering-in of the myth of the west bevor die nacht sinkt eine lange nacht vielleicht und ein tiefes vergessen he choose a medieval legend of incest gregorius vom stein and freely borrow and parody other myth of the west mix theme language people and time in a master myth in which the old form continually renew themselves a in he previous treatment of joseph but the holy sinner be not simply a retell of old story for an old man s entertainment mann understand good than most man the incest comedy at the center of the myth and the psychological truth in which dread be show a the other face a long be for he just the kind of deep and complicate joke he like to tell and when he retold the legend of gregorius he interpolate a modern version in which the medieval player speak contemporary thought in archaic language while they move through the pageantry of the ancient incest myth and cover themselves through not-knowing they reveal the unconscious motive in seek each other and in the last scene make an extraordinary confession of guilt in the twentieth-century manner grigorss be the child of an incestuous union between a royal brother and sister the twin sibylla and wiligis he be bear in secrecy after the death of he father and cast adrift soon after birth the infant be discover by a fisherman who bring he home to rear he an ivory tablet in the infant s cask recount the story of he sinful origin and be preserve for the child by the monk of a monastery in the fish village grigorss at seventeen learn he story and go forth a a knight to uncover he origin he sail vessel be guide by fate to the shore of he own country at a time when sibylla s domain be overrun by the army of one of she reject suitor grigorss overcome the suitor in battle deliver the city from it oppressor and marry sibylla who have fall in love with the beautiful knight the moment she see he sibylla be pregnant with they second child when she find the ivory tablet conceal by she husband and the identity of mother and son be reveal grigorss go off to do penance on a rock for seventeen year at the end of this period two pious christian in rome receive the revelation which lead they to seek the next pope on the rock grigorss come to rome and become a great and beloved pope in the last page of the book sibylla come to rome to seek an audience with the great pope and to give she confession mother and son recognize each other and in mann s version of this legend make a remarkable confession of guilt to each other the confession of unconscious motive and unconscious knowledge of they true identity from the time they have first set eye on each other
