there be fence in the old day when we be child across the front of a yard and down the side they be iron either spike along the top or arch in half circle alley fence be make of solid board high than one s head but not so high a the golden glow in a corner or the hollyhock that grow in a line against they side fence be hide beneath lilac and hundred-leaf rose front fence be cover with virginia creeper or trumpet vine or honeysuckle square corner - and gate post be an open-work pattern of cast-iron foliage they be top by steeple complete in every detail high-pitched roof pinnacle and narrow gable on these post the gate swing open with a squeak and shut with a metallic clang the only extend view possible to anyone less tall than the fence be that obtain from an upper bough of the apple tree the primary quality of that view seem now to have be it quietness but that can not at the time have impress we what one actually remember be it greenness from high in the tree the whole block lie within range of the eye but the ground be almost nowhere visible one look down on a sea of leave a break wave of flower every path from back door to barn be cover by a grape-arbor and every yard have it fruit tree in the center of any open space remain we grandfather have plant syringa and sweet-shrub snowball rose-of-sharon and balm-of-gilead from above one could only occasionally catch a glimpse of life on the floor of this green sea a neighbor s gingham skirt flash into sight for an instant on the path beneath she grape-arbor or the movement of hand above a clothesline and the flutter of garment hang there half-way down the block that be one epoch the apple-tree epoch another have end before it begin time be a queer thing and memory a queer the trick that time play with memory and memory with time be queer of all from maturity one look back at the succession of year count they and make they many yet can not feel length in the number however large in a stream that turn a mill-wheel there be a lot of water the mill-pond be quiet it surface dark and shadow and there do not seem to be much water in it time in the sum be nothing and yet a year to a child be an eternity and in the memory that phase of one s be a certain mental landscape will seem to have endure without begin and without end the part of the mind that preserve date and event may remonstrate it could have be like that for only a little while but true memory do not count nor add it hold fast to thing that be and they be outside of time once then for how many year or how few do not matter i world be bind round by fence when i be too small to reach the apple tree bough to twist i knee over it and pull myself up that world be in scale with i own smallness i have no picture in i mind of the garden a a whole that i could not see but certain aspect of certain corner linger in the memory wind-blown frost-bitten white chrysanthemum beneath a window with they brittle brown leave and they sharp scent of november ripe pear lie in long grass to be turn over by a dusty-slippered foot cautiously lest bee still work in the rag brown-edged hole hot-colored verbena in the corner between the dining-room wall and the side porch where we pass on we way to the pump with the half-gourd tie to it a a cup by i grandmother for we childish pleasure in drink from it it be mother who plant the verbena i think that i grandmother be not an impassioned gardener she be too indulgent a lover of dog and grandchildren i great-grandmother i have be tell make she garden she great pride she cherish rare and delicate plant like oleander in tub and wall-flowers and lemon verbena in pot that have to be winter in the cellar she fill the waste spot of the yard with common thing like the garden heliotrope in a corner by the woodshed and the plantain lily along the west side of the house these i grandmother leave in they place they be still there more persistent and longer-lived than the generation of man and plant other like they that flourish without careful tend three of these only be protect from we by stern commandment the rose whose petal might not be collect until they have fall to be make into perfume or rose-tea to drink the peony whose tight sticky bud would be blight by the lay on of a finger although they be not apparently harm by the ant that crawl over they and the poppy i have more than once sit cross-legged in the grass through a long summer morning and watch without touch while a poppy bud high than i head slowly but visibly push off it cap unfold and shake out like a banner in the sun it flame vermilion petal other flower we might gather a we please myrtle and white violet from beneath the lilac the lilac themselves that bloom so prodigally but for the most part beyond we reach snowball hollyhock blossom that turn upside down make pink-petticoated lady and the little dark blue larkspur that scatter it seed everywhere more potent a charm to bring back that time of life than this record of a few picture and a few remember fact would be a catalogue of the minutiae which be of the very stuff of the mind intrinsic because they be know in the begin not by the eye alone but by the hand that hold they flower stone and small creature live and dead pale yellow snapdragon that by pinch could be make to bite seed-pod of the balsam that snap like fire-crackers at a touch red-and-yellow columbine whose round-tipped spur be pick off and eat for the honey in they morning-glory bud which could be so grasp and squeeze that they burst like a blown-up paper bag bright flower from the trumpet vine that make glove on the end of ten waggle finger fuzzy caterpillar snail with they sensitive horn struggle grasshopper hold by they long hind leg and command to spit tobacco spit dead fledgling bird they squashed-looking nakedness and the odor of decay that cling to the hand when they have be bury in we graveyard in front of the purple flag and the cast shell of a locust straw-colored and transparent weigh nothing fragile but entire with eye like bubble and a gape slit down it back every morning early in the summer we search the trunk of the tree a high a we could reach for the locust shell carefully detach they hook claw from the bark where they hang and stable they a weird faery herd in an angle between the high root of the tulip tree where no grass grow in the dense shade we collect lucky stone all the creamy translucent pebble wear smooth and round that we could find in the driveway when these have be pockete we could still spend a morning crack open other pebble for we delight in see how much pretty they be inside than they dull exterior indicate we show they to each other and say would you have guess squat on we haunch beside the flat stone we break they on we be safe behind the high close gate at the end of the drive safe from interruption and the observation and possible amusement of the passers-by thus shield we play many foolish game in comfortable unselfconsciousness even when the fence become a part of the game when a vine-embowered gate-post be the sleep beauty s enchant castle or when rapunzel let down she golden hair from beneath the crocketed spire even then we pay little heed to those who go by on the path outside we enjoy a paradoxical freedom when we be still too young for school in the heat of the summer the garden solitude be ours alone we elder stay in the dark house or sit fan on the front porch they never trouble themselves about we while we be play because the fence form such a definite boundary and do nt go outside the gate be a command so impossible of misinterpretation we be not however entirely unacquainted with the vary aspect of the street we be forbid to swing on the gate lest they sag on they hinge in a poor-white-trash way but we could stand on they when they be latch rest we chin on the top and stare and stare commit to memory quite unintentionally all the detail that lie before we eye the street that be full now of traffic and park car then and for many year drowse on an august afternoon in the shade of the curbside tree and silence be a weight almost palpable in the air every slight sound that rise against that pressure fall away again crush beneath it a hay-wagon move slowly along the gutter the top of it sweep by the low bough of the maple tree and loose straw be leave hang tangle among the leave a wheel squeak on a hub be still and squeak again if a child watch it progress he whisper hay hay load of hay make a wish and turn away and then stare rigidly in the opposite direction until the sound of the horse foot return no more when the hay wagon have go and an interval pass a huckster s cart might turn the corner the horse walk the rein be slack the huckster ride with bow shoulder he forearm across he knee sleepily a if half-reluctant to break the silence he lift he voice rhu-beb-ni-ice nice fresh rhu-beb today the lazy sing-song be space in time like the drone of a bumble-bee no one seem to hear he no one heed the horse plod on and he repeat he call it become so monotonous a to seem a part of the quietness after he passage the street be empty again the sun move slant-wise across the sky and down the tree shadow circle from street to sidewalk from sidewalk to lawn at four-oclock or four-thirty the come of the newsboy mark the end of the day he toss a paper toward every front door and housewife come down to they step to pick they up and read what they neighbor have be do the street of any county town be like this on any sunshiny afternoon in summer they be like this fifty-odd year ago and yesterday but the fence be still in place fifty-odd year ago and when we stand on the gate to look over the sidewalk under we eye be not cement but two row of pave stone with grass between and on both side the curb be a line of stone lay edgewise in the dirt and tilt this way and that by frost in the ground or the root of tree opposite every gate be a hitch post or a stone carriage-step set with a rusty iron ring for tie a horse the street be unpaved and rise steeply toward the center it be mud in wet weather and dust ankle-deep in dry and could be cross only at the corner where there be step stone it have a bucolic atmosphere that it have lose long since the hoofmarks of cattle and the print of bare foot in the mud or in the dust be a numerous a the trace of shoe horse cow be keep in backyard barn boy be hire to drive they to and from the pasture on the edge of town and familiar to the ear morning and even be the boy coax voice the thud of hoof and the thwack of a stick on cowhide
