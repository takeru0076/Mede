the follow item may be specify in actual or symbolic form in the operand of those instruction which refer to the particular item channel unit combine channel and unit combine arm and file unit record synchronizers inquiry synchronizers and alteration switch the declarative operation equ be use to equate symbolic name to item number see page 85 continuation card certain autocoder statement make provision for more parameter than may be contain in the operand column 21 - 75 of a single line on the autocoder code sheet when this be the case the appropriate section of this manual will indicate that continuation card may be use thus when specifically permit the operand of a give line on the autocoder code sheet may be continue in the operand of from one to four additional line which immediately follow the label and operation column must be blank and the continuation of the operand must begin in column 21 ie it must be left-justified in the operand column of the code sheet the operand need not extend across the entire operand column of either the header card or continuation card but may end with the comma follow any parameter remark may appear to the right of the last parameter on each card provide they be separate from the operand by at least two blank space illustration of the use of continuation card be include throughout the example illustrate the various statement if a continuation card follow a statement that do not permit continuation card the compiler will generate a nop and issue an error message additional restriction regard the use of continuation card with macro-instructions appear on page 106 reservation of index word and electronic switch the assignment of actual address to symbolic index word and electronic switch name occur in phase 3 of the autocoder processor the initial availability of index word and electronic switch be determine by a table which be include in the compiler system tape this table originally indicate that index word 1 through 96 and electronic switch 1 through 30 be available for assignment to symbolic reference index word 97 through 99 be not available the initial set of this table may be alter however a describe in the 70707074 data process system bulletin ibm 70707074 compiler system operate procedure form afj during the first pass of phase 3 reference to the actual address of index word and electronic switch be collect and the availability table be update at the end of this pass the table indicate which index word and electronic switch be not available for assignment to symbolic reference both index word and electronic switch may have be make unavailable before the start of assignment in one of the follow way 1 the initial set of the availability table indicate that the index word or electronic switch be not available for assignment 2 the one - or two-digit number of the index word or electronic switch be use in the operand of a symbolic machine instruction to specify index or a a parameter which be always an index word or electronic switch eg 3 the one - or two-digit number of the index word or electronic switch be use in the operand of an equ statement eg when the index word or electronic switch be reserve because of actual usage in the statement describe above the position or order of the statement within the program be not important any such reference will make the index word or electronic switch unavailable at the end of this pass during the assignment pass of phase 3 index word and electronic switch be reserve a they be encounter during assignment index word and electronic switch may be reserve in the follow way the first two method apply to both index word and electronic switch the third apply only to index word 1 during the assignment pass each instruction be examine for reference to the symbolic name of an index word or electronic switch when such a reference be find an actual address be assign and the availability table be change so that the assign index word or switch be no long available for late assignment 2 if the one - or two-digit address of an index word or electronic switch be use or be include in the operand of an xreserve or sreserve statement see page 99 the correspond index word or electronic switch be reserve 3 if a statement have be assign an address in the index word area by mean of an actual label or by mean of an origin statement which refer to an actual address the correspond index word will be reserve these entry should normally appear at the begin of the program or immediately follow each litorigin statement otherwise symbolic name may have previously be assign to these same index word this method do not apply to electronic switch the precede method allow efficient use of index word and electronic switch during a sectionalized or multi-phase program particularly when use in conjunction with the litorigin statement extreme caution should be use however to avoid the conflict usage of an index word or electronic switch which may result from the assignment of more than one name or function to the same address if the symbolic name or actual address of an index word or electronic switch appear or be include in the operand of an xrelease or srelease statement see page 101 the specify index word or electronic switch will again be make available regardless of the method by which it be reserve it will not however be use for symbolic assignment until all other index word or electronic switch have be assign for the first time if at any time during the assignment pass the compiler find that there be no more index word available for assignment the warn message no more index word available will be place in the object program list the table will be alter to show that index word 1 through 96 be available and the assignment will continue a before if the compiler find that there be no more electronic switch available for assignment the warn message no more electronic switch available will be place in the object program list the table will be alter to show that electronic switch 1 through 30 be available and assignment will continue a before the resultant conflict usage of index word or electronic switch may be avoid by reduce the number of symbolic name use eg through the proper use of the equ xrelease or srelease statement a note in appendix c index word 97 through 99 be never available for assignment to symbolic name by the compiler also index word 93 through 96 may have be make unavailable for assignment declarative statement autocoder declarative statement provide the processor with the necessary information to complete the imperative operation properly declarative statement be never execute in the object program and should be separate from the program instruction area place preferably at it begin or end otherwise special care must be take to branch around they so that the program will not attempt to execute something in a data area a an instruction if the compiler do encounter such statement a warn message will be issue 70707074 autocoder include the follow declarative statement da define area dc define constant drdw define record definition word dsw define switch dline define line equ equate codedtf define tape file diocs define input control system and duf descriptive entry for unit record da dc dtf and dline require more than one entry the da statement be use to name and define the position and length of field within an area the dc statement be use to name and enter constant into the object program since the 7070 and 7074 make use of record definition word rdws to read write move and otherwise examine block of storage the da and dc statement provide the option of generate rdws automatically when so instruct autocoder will generate one or more rdws and assign they successive location immediately precede the area with which they be to be associate an rdw will be of the form afj where xxxx be the start location of the area and yyyy be it end location these address be calculate automatically by the processor in some case it may be more advantageous to assign location to rdws associate with da and dc area in some other part of storage ie not immediately precede the da or dc area the drdw statement may be use for this purpose the drdw statement may also be use to generate an rdw define any area specify by the programmer a many a ten digital switch may be name and provide by the dsw statement for consideration by the setsw and logic macro-instructions each switch occupy one digit position in a word can be set on or off and be consider a logically equivalent to an electronic switch it can not however be refer to by electronic switch command eg esn bsn etc an individual switch or the entire set of switch in a word may be test or alter a desire through use of the dline statement a mean be provide for specify both the edit of field to be insert in a print line area and the layout of the area itself the area may include constant information supply by the programmer the area may also be provide with additional data during the run of the object program by mean of edmov or move macro-instructions the declarative statement equ permit the programmer to equate symbolic name to actual index word electronic switch arm and file number tape channel and unit number alteration switch etc and to equate a symbol to another symbol or to an actual address the diocs dtf and duf statement be use when require by the input control system diocs be use to select the major method of process to be use and to name the index word use by afj each tape file must be describe by tape file specification produce by afj in addition to information relate to the file and it record the file specification contain subroutine location and the location of tape label information a duf entry must be supply for every unit record file describe the type of file and the unit record equipment to be use the duf also supply the location of subroutine write by the user that be unique to the file a full description of the diocs dtf and duf statement be contain in the 7070 data process system bulletin ibm 7070 input control system form afj brief description of these three declarative statement and detail description of the format and function of each of the other 70707074 autocoder declarative statement follow below diocs define input control system when the input control system be to be use in a program a diocs statement must be use to select the major method of process to be use this statement also allow the name of the index word use by afj source program format the basic format of the diocs statement be a follow anylabel be any symbolic label it may be omit the entry diocs must be write exactly a show the first item in the operand iocsixf be use to specify the first iocs index word for program use tape file this item may be a symbolic name or an actual one-digit or two-digit index word address in the range 3 - 94 if the first item in the operand be omit the symbolic name iocsixf will be assign when an actual index word or a symbolic address be specify autocoder will equate the name iocsixf to it the second item in the operand iocsixg be use to specify the second iocs index word for program use tape file this item may be a symbolic name or an actual one-digit or two-digit index word address in the range 3 - 94 if the second item in the operand be omit the symbolic name iocsixg will be assign when an actual index word or a symbolic address be specify autocoder will equate iocsixg to it
