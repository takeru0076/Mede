than in past meeting this have be a work session of an organization that by it very nature can only proceed along it route step by step and without dramatic change in oslo the minister have meet in a climate of candor and make a genuine attempt to get information and understand one another s problem this atmosphere of understand have be particularly noticeable where relation be concern between the colonialist power and those who have never or not for a long time have such problem the nightmare of a clash between those in trouble in africa exacerbate by the difficulty change and tragedy face they and other ally who intellectually and emotionally disapprove of the circumstance that have bring these trouble about have be conspicuous by it absence explosion avoid in the case of portugal which a few week ago be rumored ready to walk out of the nato council should critic of it angola policy prove harsh there have be a noticeable relaxation of tension the general remarkably courteous explanation have leave basic position unchanged but there have be no explosion in the council there should even be no more bitter surprise in the un general assembly a to nato member vote since a new ad hoc nato committee have be set up so that in the future such topic a angola will be discuss in advance canada alone have be somewhat out of step with the oslo attempt to get all the ally car back on the track behind the nato locomotive even norway despite daily but limit manifestation against atomic arm in the heart of this northernmost capital of the alliance be today close to the nato line on the negative side of the balance sheet must be set some disappointment that the unite state leadership have not be a much in evidence a hope for one diplomat describe the tenor of secretary of state dean rusk s speech a inconclusive but he hasten to add that if unite state policy be not always clear despite mr rusk s analysis of the various global danger point and setback for the west this may merely mean the new administration have not yet firmly fix it policy exploratory mood a certain vagueness may also be cause by tactical appreciation of the fact that the present council meet be a semipublic affair with no fewer than six soviet correspondent accredit the impression have nevertheless be give during these three day despite mr rusk s personal popularity that the unite state delegation come to oslo in a somewhat tentative and exploratory frame of mind more ready to listen and learn than to enunciate firm policy on a global scale with detail application to individual danger spot the secretary of state himself in he first speech give some idea of the tremendous march of event inside and outside the unite state that have preoccupy the new administration in the past four month but where the core of nato be concern the secretary of state have not only reiterate the unite state profound attachment to the alliance cornerstone of it foreign policy but have announce that five nuclear submarine will eventually be at nato s disposal in european water the secretary of state have also solemnly repeat a warn to the soviet union that the unite state will not stand for another setback in berlin an affirmation once again take up by the council a a whole conflict survey the secretary s great achievement be perhaps the rekindle of nato realization that east-west friction wherever it take place around the globe be in essence the general conflict between two entirely different society and must be treat a such without regard to geographical distance or lack of apparent connection the annual spring meet have give an impetus in three main direction more deep and more timely political consultation within the alliance the use of the organization for economic cooperation and development when ratify a a method of coordinate aid to the underdeveloped country and the need for strengthen conventional force a well a the maintenance of the nuclear deterrent this increase in the threshold a the conventional force strengthen be call will prove one of the alliance s most difficult problem in the month to come each ally will have to carry out obligation long since lay down but never completely fulfil washington the kennedy administration move haltingly toward a geneva conference on laos just a serious debate over it foreign policy erupt for the first time there be little optimism here that the communist will be any more docile at the conference table than they be in military action on the ground in laos the unite state state department official explain now be mainly interest in set up an international inspection system which will prevent laos from be use a a base for communist attack on neighboring thailand and south viet nam they count on the aid of the neutral country attend the geneva conference to achieve this the unite state hope that any future lao cabinet would not become communist dominate but it be apparent that no acceptable formula have be find to prevent such a possibility policy modify the inclination here be to accept a de facto cease-fire in laos rather than continue to insist on a verification of the cease-fire by the international control commission before participate in the geneva conference this be another of the modification of policy on laos that the kennedy administration have feel compel to make it excuse these action a be the chain reaction to basic error make in the previous administration it spokesman insist that there have not be time enough to institute reform in military and economic aid policy in the critical area but with the month move on and the immediate confrontation with the communist show no gain for the free world the question arise how effective have kennedy administration first foreign policy decision be in deal with communist aggression former vice-president richard m nixon in detroit call for a firm and tough policy toward the soviet union he be critical of what he feel be president kennedy s tendency to be too conciliatory gop restrain it do not take a gallup poll to find out that most republican in congress feel this understate the situation a republican see it they can hardly restrain themselves from raise the question of whether republican if they have be in power would have make amateurish and monumental blunder in cuba one republican senator tell this correspondent that he be constantly be ask why he do nt attack the kennedy administration on this score he reply he say be that he agree to the need for unity in the country now but he far say that it be good politics to let other question the wisdom of administration policy first the republican some week ago serve notice through senator thruston b morton r of kentucky chairman of the republican national committee that the kennedy administration would be hold responsible if the outcome in laos be a coalition government susceptible of communist domination kennedy administration policy also have be assail now from another direction by 70 harvard boston university brandeis and massachusetts institute of technology educator detente urge this group plead with the administration to give no far support for the invasion of cuba by exile group it recommend that the unite state seek instead to detach the castro regime from the communist bloc by work for a diplomatic detente and a resumption of trade relation and concentrate it constructive effort on eliminate in other part of latin america the social condition on which totalitarian nationalism feed mr nixon for he part would oppose intervention in cuba without specific provocation but he do recommend that president kennedy state clearly that if communist country ship any far arm to cuba that it would not be tolerate until the cuban fiasco and the communist military victory in laos almost any observer would have say that president kennedy have blend a program that respect generally the opinion voice both by mr nixon and the professor aid plan revamp very early in he administration he inform the kremlin through diplomatic channel a high official source disclose that the new administration would react even tough than the

review and change but thus far there have be no response in kind foreign aid program be revamp to give great emphasis to economic aid and to encourage political reform in recipient nation in laos the administration look at the eisenhower administration effort to show determination by sail a naval fleet into southeast asian water a a useless gesture again and again it ask the communist to freeze the military situation in laos but the communist aid the pathet lao at an even fast rate and after several correspondent go into pathet lao territory and expose the huge build-up administration spokesman acclaim they for perform a great service and lay the matter before the southeast asia treaty organization seato be steam up and prepare contingency plan for cope with the military loss in laos but the communist never give sufficient provocation at any one time for the unite state to want to risk a limit or an all-out war over laos some seato nation disagree however there be the far complication that the administration have very early conclude that laos be ill suit to be an ally unlike it more determine neighbor thailand and south viet nam the administration declare itself in favor of a neutralize laos the pro-western government which the unite state have help in a revolt against the souvanna phouma neutralist government never do appear to spark much fight spirit in the royal lao army there certainly be not any more energy display after it be clear the unite state would not back the pro-western government to the hilt if the administration ever have any idea that it could find an acceptable alternative to prince souvanna phouma whom it feel be too trust of communist it gradually have to relinquish they one factor be the statement of senator jw fulbright d of
