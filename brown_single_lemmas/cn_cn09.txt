miraculously she find exactly the right statement she begin it deliberately so that none of she word would be lose on he i want to tell you something thoma demontez lord i m well aware that you ve get a pedigree a long a i leg and that i do nt amount to anything but but it do nt matter a-tall lord supply fondly to i you ll always be the girl o i dream an the sweet flower that grow beam idiotically he pooched out he lip and attempt to kiss she she yank away from he furiously you shut up shu-tt up-pp i ve get something to say to you and by god you re go to listen do you hear i you re go to listen lord nod agreeably he say he want very much to listen he know that anything a brainy little lady like she have to say would be plumb important a well a pleasin to the ear and he do nt want to miss a word of it so would she mind speak a little loud i think you stink tom lord i think you re mean and hateful and stupid and loud say joyce uh-huh so i can hear you while i m checkin the car look like we might be in for a speck of trouble he open the door and get out he wait at the car side for a moment look down at she expectantly well be nt you goin to say somethin then helpfully a she merely stare at he in weary silence maybe you could write it down for i huh print it in real big letter an i can cipher it out late aah go on she say just go the hell on he grin nod and walk around to the front of the car lip purse mournfully he stare down at it crazily sag leave side then he hunker down on the heel of he handmade boot peer into the orderly chaos of axle shock absorber and spring he go prone on he stomach the good to pursue he examination after a time he straighten again brush the red permian dust from he hand slap it from he six-dollar levis and he tailor twenty-five-dollar shirt he wear no gun a strange ommission for a peace officer in this country never he d once tell joyce have he encounter any man or situation that call for a gun and he really feel that way she think that s really all he s get all he be just a big pile of self-confidence in an almost teensy package if i could make myself feel the same way she study he hopefully yearningly against the limitless background of sky and wasteland it be easy to confirm she analysis here in the god-forsaken place the westerly end of nowhere tom lord look almost insignificant almost contemptible he be handsome with he coal-black hair and eye he fine-chiseled feature but she d know plenty of handsome guy and concede he good look what be there leave he be nt a big man rather on the medium side neither be he very powerful of build he could move very quickly she know although he seldom find occasion to do so but he be more wiry than truly strong and he relatively small hand and foot give he an almost delicate appearance just nothing she tell herself just so darn sure of himself that he put the indian sign on everyone but by gosh i want he and i m go to have he he catch she eye come back around the car with the boot-wearer teeter half-mincing walk why do these yokel still wear boot anyway when most have scarcely sit a horse in year he slide in at she side tuck a cigar into he mouth and politely proffer one to she oh cut it out tom she snap can nt you stop that stupid clown for even a minute this ai nt you brand maybe lord suggest or maybe you just do nt feel like a cigar i feel like get back to town that s what i feel like now be you go to take i or be i suppose to walk might get there fast walkin lord drawl seein a how i get a bust front spring on the other hand howsomever maybe you would nt either i figger it s probly a sixty-five-mile walk and i cn maybe get this spring patch up in a couple of hour how with what there s nothing out here but rattlesnake now ai nt it the truth lord laugh with secret amusement not a danged thing but rattlesnake so i reckon i ll get the boss rattler to help i tom for god s sake looky he point cut she off see that wildcat she see it then the distant derrick of the wildcat a test well in unexplored country and even with she limit knowledge of such thing she know that the car could be repair there sufficiently at least to get they back into town a wildcatter have to be prepare for almost any emergency he have to depend on himself since he be invariably mile and hour away from other well let s get go she say impatiently i she break off frown what do you mean by that rattlesnake gag get the boss rattlesnake to help you why i mean what i say lord declare what else would i mean anyway she look at he lip compress then with a shrug of pretend indifference she take a compact from she purse and go through the motion of fix she make-up in he mood it be the good way to handle he that be to show no curiosity whatsoever otherwise she would be bait into a tantrum tease and provoke until she lose control of herself and thus lose still another battle in the madden struggle of tom lord vs joyce lakewood the car lurch along at a snail s crawl the left-front mudguard bang and scrape against the tire occasionally scrape against the road itself lord whistle tunelessly a he fight the steer wheel he seem very please with himself a though some intricate scheme be work out exactly a he have plan along with this self-satisfaction however joyce sense a grow tension it pour out of he like an electric current a feel that the muscle and nerve of he fine-drawn body be coil for action and that that action would be all that he anticipate joyce have see he like this once before more than once actually but on one particularly memorable occasion that be the day that he have practically mop up the main street of big sand with aaron mcbride field boss for the highland oil & gas company tom have be lay for aaron mcbride for a long time just wait to catch he out of line mcbride give he he opportunity when he show up in town with a pistol on he hip he have a legitimate reason for wear it it be payday for highland and he be pack a lot of money back into the oil field moreover a long a the weapon be carry openly the sheriff s office have make no previous issue of it so what s this all about he demand when lord confront he i m not the only man in town with a gun or the only one without a permit it be the wrong thing to say by fail to do a he be tell instantly to take out a permit or return the gun to he car he have play into lord s hand the trouble be that he have virtually have to protest the deputy have force he to by he manner of accost he so how about it he say why single i out on this permit deal well i ll tell you about that lord tell he we aim t be see-lective yknow do nt like to bother no one unless we have to which i figger we do in you case figger we get to be plumb careful with any of you highland big shot mcbride redden he himself have hear that there be gangster money in the company but that have nothing to do with he he be an honest man do a hard job and the implication that he be anything else be unbearable look lord he say hoarsely i know you ve get a grudge against i and maybe i can nt blame you you think that highland swindle you and i help em do it but you re all wrong man i m no lawyer i just do what i m tell and uh-huh an that could mean trouble with a fella that s workin for crook so you get rid of that pistol right now mis-ter mcbride you do that or take you out a permit right now mcbride could nt do either of course not immediately a the deputy demand not without a face-saving respite of at least a few minute to do so would make he job well-nigh impossible oil-field worker be a rough-tough lot how could he exert authority over they make they toe the line a he have to if he knuckle under to this small-town clown i ll get around to it a little late he mumble desperately just a soon a i go to the bank and huh-uh now mis-ter mcbride say lord and he lay a firmly restrain hand on the field boss s arm it be strictly the deputy s game but mcbride have go too far to throw in now he could only play the last card in what be probably the world s cold deck he fling off lord s hand and attempt to push past he inadvertently shove he into a storefront it be practically the last move that mcbride make of he own volition lord slug he in the stomach so hard that the organ almost press against he spine then a he double gasp vomit the breakfast he have so lately eat lord straighten he with an uppercut a rabbit punch redouble he and then there be a numb blow to the heart and another gut-flattening blow to the stomach but he could nt keep up with they no more could he defend himself against they he seem to be fight not one man but a dozen and he could no long think of face-saving of honor but only of escape why he s go to kill i he think wildly i mean he no harm i ve give willful hurt to no man i be just do i job just follow order and for that he s go to kill i beat i to death in front of a hundred people somehow more terrible than the certainty that he be about to die be the knowledge that lord would probably not suffer for it the murder would go unpunished he mcbride would be cite a in the wrong and he lord would go scot-free an officer who have only do he duty though perhaps too energetically mcbride stagger into the street flop sprawl in the sting dust fear-maddened flee the lengthen shadow of death he scramble to he foot again he could nt see he be long past the point of coherent think dimly he hear laughter hoot of derision but he could not read the racket properly he could not grasp that lord have withdraw from the fight minute ago and that he leaden arm be flail at nothing but the air he hate they too much to understand the people of this isolate law-unto-itself world that be lord s world this he be sure be the way they would act laugh at a die man laugh a a man be beat to death and nothing would be do about it nothing unless donna donna he young wife the girl who be both daughter and wife to he donna be like he be she live by the rule never compromise never blind or divert by circumstance and donna would when he regain consciousness he be in lord s house in the office of doctor lord the deputy s deceased father
