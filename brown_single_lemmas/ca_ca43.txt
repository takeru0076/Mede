holder of toll-road bond be find improvement in monthly report on operation of the turnpike long-term trend of traffic on these road seem clearly upward high toll rate also be help boost revenue result be a good prospect for a full payoff by bond that once be regard a highly speculative thing be look up these day for many of the state turnpike on which investor depend for income from they toll-road bond traffic on nearly all the turnpike have be grow that add traffic mean rise stream of dime and quarter at toll gate a a result of the new outlook for turnpike investor who buy toll-road bond when these security rank a outright speculation be now find new hope for they investment another result be that buyer be tend to bid up the price of these tax-exempt bond other tax-exempt bond of state and local government hit a price peak on february 21 accord to standard & poor s average on balance price of those bond have slip a bit since then however in the same three-month period toll-road bond a a group have buck this trend on these bond price rise since february 21 easily outnumber price decline tax-free return investor however still see an element of more-than-ordinary risk in the toll-road bond you find the evidence of that in the chart on this page many of the toll-road bond still be sell at price that offer the prospect of an annual yield of 4 per cent or very close to that and this be true in the case of some turnpike on which revenue have rise close to or beyond the point at which the road start to pay all operate cost plus annual interest on the bond that 4 per cent yield be well below the return to be have on good corporation bond it s not much more in fact than the return that be offer on we treasury bond for investor whose income be tax at high rate though a tax-free yield of 4 per cent be high it be the equivalent of 8 per cent for an unmarried investor with more than $ 16000 of income to be tax or for a marry couple with more than $ 32000 of tax income swell traffic a new report on the earnings record of toll road in the most recent 12-month period end in february or march show what be happen the report be base on a survey by blyth & company investment banker nearly all the turnpike show gain in net revenue during the period and there be the bright note the gain be achieve in the face of temporary traffic lag late in 1960 and early in 1961 a a result of business recession many of the road also be hit by an unusually severe winter indication the long-term trend of turnpike traffic be upward look for example at the ohio turnpike traffic on that road slump sharply in january and february a compare with those same month in 1960 then march bring an 18 per cent rise in net revenue after operate cost a a result the road s net revenue in the 12 month end march 31 be 186 per cent of the annual interest payment on the turnpike bond that be up from 173 per cent in the precede 12 month that same pattern of earnings show up on the massachusetts turnpike operate revenue be off in the first three month of 1961 but up for the 12 month end in march cost be hold down despite a bitter winter for the year the road earn 133 per cent of it interest cost against 121 per cent in the precede period the road s engineer look for far improvement when the turnpike be extend into boston slow success some turnpike have not be in full operation long enough to prove what they can do the 187-mile illinois state toll highway for example be not open over it entire length until december 1958 in the 12 month end in february 1960 the highway earn enough to cover 64 per cent of it interest load with the remainder pay out of initial reserve in the 12 month end in february 1961 this highway earn 93 per cent of it interest that improvement be continue in the first two month of 1961 earnings of the illinois highway available for interest payment be up 55 per cent from early 1960 success for many turnpike have come hard traffic frequently have fail to measure up to engineer rosy estimate in these case the turnpike management have have to turn to toll-rate increase or to costly improvement such a extension or good connection with other highway many rate increase already have be put into effect high toll be plan for july 1 1961 on the richmond-petersburg va turnpike and proposal for increase toll on the texas turnpike be under study easy access progress be be make too in improve motorist access to many turnpike the kansas turnpike offer an illustration net earnings of that road rise from 62 per cent of interest requirement in calendar 1957 to 86 per cent in the 12 month end feb 28 1961 far improvement in earnings of the kansas turnpike be expect late in 1961 with the open of a new bypass at wichita and still late when the turnpike get downtown connection in both kansas city kans and kansas city mo meanwhile there appear to be enough money in the road s reserve fund to cover the interest deficiency for eight more year for some road trouble investor study the toll-road bond for opportunity find that not all road be near they goal traffic and revenue on the chicago skyway have be a great disappointment to planner and investor alike if nothing be do the prospect be that that road will be in default of interest in 1962 west virginia toll bond have default in interest for month and despite recent improvement in revenue holder of the bond be face with more of the same these however be exception the typical picture at this time be one of steady improvement it s go to take time for investor to learn how many of the toll-road bond will pay out in full already however several of the turnpike be earn enough to cover interest requirement by comfortable margin many other be attract the traffic need to push revenue up to the break-even point a top american official after a look at europe s factory think the we be in a very serious situation competitively commerce secretary luther hodges accompany by a member of we staff on may 10 tour plant of two of italy s big company fiat the auto producer and olivetti maker of typewriter and calculate machine we staff man cable from turin a follow follow secretary hodges through the fiat plant and you learn this one modern equipment much of it supply under the marshall plan enable fiat to turn out 2100 car a day about half of these be export two wage cost be a fraction of the we cost a skilled worker on the assembly line for example earn $ 37 a week three labor trouble be infrequent fiat official say they have have no strike for more than six year say secretary hodges it s a tough combination for the we to face olivetti have a special interest for hodges olivetti take over underwood the we typewriter maker in late 1959 within a year without reduce wage underwood s production cost be cut one third price be slash the result have be that export of underwood product have double the olivetti plant near turin have modern layout modern machinery the firm be design-conscious sales-conscious advertising-conscious hodges be try to get more foreign business to go to the we the inflow of foreign capital would help the we balance of payment hodges predict i think we will see more foreign firm come to the we there be many place where we can use they vigor and new idea foreign competition have become so severe in certain textile that washington be explore new way of handle competitive import the recently unveil kennedy move to control the international textile market can be significant for american businessman in many line important aspect of the kennedy textile plan be these an international conference of the big textile-importing and textile-exporting country will be call shortly by president kennedy chief aim of the propose conference be worth note the we will try to get agreement among the industrialize country to take more textile import from the less-developed country over the year point be that develop country often build up a textile industry first need encouragement to get on they foot if they have trouble export international bill for they support will grow large than it otherwise would idea be to let these country earn they way a much a possible at the same time another purpose of the conference will be to get certain low-wage country to control textile export especially dump of specific product to high-wage textile-producing country japan since 1957 have be voluntarily curb export of textile to the we hong kong india and pakistan have be limit export of certain type of textile to britain for several year under the lancashire pact none of these country be happy with these arrangement the japanese want to increase export to the we while they have be curb shipment they have watch hong kong step in and capture an expand share of the big we market hong kong interest loudly protest limit they export to britain while spanish and portuguese textile pour into british market unrestrictedly the indian and pakistani be chafe under similar restriction on the british market for similar reason the kennedy hope be that at the conference or through bilateral talk the low-wage textile-producing country in asia and europe will see that dump practice cause friction all around and may result in import quota gradual control expansion of the world s textile trade be what president kennedy want this may point the way toward international stabilization agreement in other product it s an important clue to washington think note too that the kennedy textile plan look toward modernization or shrinkage of the we textile industry get competitive or get out in veil term that s what the kennedy administration be say to the american textile industry the government will help in transfer company and worker into new line where modernization do nt seem feasible special depreciation on new textile machinery may be allow government research will look into new product and method import quota be nt rule out where the national interest be involve but the kennedy administration do nt favor import quota rather they be impress with the british government s success in force and help the british textile industry to shrink and to change over to other product what s happen in textile can be handwriting on the wall for other line have difficulty compete with import from low-wage country among the highest-paid worker in the world be we coal miner yet we coal be cheap enough to make foreign steelmaker mouth water steel company of wale a british steelmaker want to bring in virginia coal cut down on it taking of welsh coal in order to be able to compete more effectively especially in foreign market virginia coal deliver by ship in wale will be about $ 280 a ton cheap than welsh coal deliver by rail from nearby mine we coal be cheap despite high wage because of widespread mechanization of mine wide coal seam attactive rate on ocean freight many of the coal seam in the nationalize british mine be twist narrow and very deep productivity of we miner be twice that of the british welsh coal miner communist-led be up in arm at the suggestion that the steel company bring in american coal they threaten to strike the british government will have to decide whether to let we coal in the british coal industry be unprofitable have large coal stock it can nt sell
