the rhode island property tax there be a time some year ago when local taxation by the city and town be sufficient to support they own operation and a part of the cost of the state government a well for many year a state tax on city and town be pay by the several municipality to the state from the proceed of the general property tax this tax be discontinue in 1936 since that time the demand of the citizen for new and expand service have place financial burden on the state which could not have be foresee in early year at the same time there have be an upgrade and expansion of municipal service a well thus there have come into be a situation in which the state must raise all of it own revenue and in addition must give assistance to it local government this financial assistance from the state have become necessary because the local government themselves find the property tax or at least at the rate then exist insufficient for they requirement consequently there have develop several form of grants-in-aid and share tax a well a the unrestricted grant to local government for general purpose whose adoption accompany the introduction of a sales tax at the state level notwithstanding state aid the local government be continue to seek additional revenue of they own by strengthen the property tax this be be do both by the revaluation of real property and by seek out form of personal property hitherto neglect or ignore taxation of tangible movable property in rhode island have be generally of a hand off nature due possibly to several reason 1 local assessor in the main be not well pay and have inadequate office staff 2 the numerous category of this component of personal property make locate extremely difficult and 3 the inexperience of the majority of assessor in evaluate this type of property problem of tax personal property among the many problem in the tax of personal property and of movable tangible property in particular two be significant 1 situs 2 fair and equitable assessment of value these problem be not local to rhode island but be recognize a common to all state situs of property although the law of the various state in general specify the situs of property ie residence or domicile of the owner or location of the property the exception regard boat airplane mobile home etc seem to add to the uncertainty of the proper origination point for assessment rhode island law specify that all real estate be taxable in the town in which it be situate it also provide for the taxation of all personal property belong to inhabitant of the state both tangible and intangible and the tangible personal property of non-resident in this state in define personal property it specifically mention all ship or vessel at home or abroad intangible property be taxable wherever the owner have a place of abode the great portion of the year although a similar situs for tangible property be mention in the statute this be cancel out by the provision that definite kind of property and all other tangible property situate or be in any town be taxable where the property be situate this would seem to fix the tax situs of all movable personal property at it location on december 31 both boat and aircraft would fall within this category a well a motor vehicle the location of the latter now be determine for tax purpose at the time of registration and it be now accept practice to consider a motor vehicle a be situate where it be garage obviously it would be impossible to determine where every vehicle might be on the 31st day of december in view of the acceptance accord the status of motor vehicle for tax purpose in the absence of any specific provision it would seem entirely consistent to apply the same interpretation to boat or aircraft a recent example of this problem be the fly of six airplane on december 31 1960 from the newport airpark in middletown to the north central airport in smithfield this situation result in both town claim the tax and probably justifiably middletown base it claim on the general provision of the law that all rateable property both tangible and intangible shall be tax to the owner thereof in the town in which such owner shall have have he actual place of abode for the large portion of the twelve 12 month next precede the first day of april in each year the smithfield tax assessor in turn claim the tax under the provision of law and all other tangible personal property situate or be in any town in or upon any place of storage shall be tax to such person in the town where say property be situate assessment of value this problem of fair and equitable assessment of value be a difficult one to solve in that the determination of fair valuation be dependent on local assessor who in general be non-professional and part-time personnel take an individualistic approach to the problem this account for the wide variance in assessment practice of movable tangible property in the various municipality in rhode island this condition will undoubtedly continue until such time a a state uniform system of evaluation be establish or through mutual agreement of the local assess official for a method of standard assessment practice to be adopt the rhode island public expenditure council in it publication once comment the most realistic way of face up to this problem would be to have the state take over full responsibility for assess all taxable property an adequately staff and equip state assess office could apply uniform method and standard which would go far toward produce equitable assessment on all property throughout the state a single statewide assess unit would eliminate the difference and complication that be inherent in a system of 39 different and independent assess unit the institute of public administration in it report to the state fiscal study commission in 1959 recommend consolidate and centralize all aspect of property tax administration in a single state agency professionally organize and equip for the job the result setup it be declare would be similar to that which be in successful operation in a number of metropolitan county a large or large than rhode island practice in rhode island to determine the practice and attitude of municipal government concern tangible movable property a questionnaire be send to all local government assessor or board of assessor in rhode island the reply from each individual town be not give in detail because the question ask the personal opinion of the several assessor and be not necessarily the establish policy of the town in each case there be legitimate reason for difference of opinion among the assessor a a whole and among the public official in each town these opinion of the assessor be of significance in indicate what they think seem to be at the present time in reply to a question of whether they now tax boat airplane and other movable property exclude automobile nineteen say that they do and twenty that they do not the word of the question be quite general and may have be subject to different interpretation one assessor check boat only another trailer and tractor one mention house trailer and two other refer to trailer without specify the type in two case airplane only be indicate it be difficult to tabulate exactly what be mean in each individual situation but the conclusion may be draw that 21 town do not assess movable personal property and of the remainder only certain type be value for tax purpose boat be indicate specifically by only one of the five town know to tax boat it would seem then that movable property and equipment be not tax a a whole but that certain type be tax in town where this be bind to be expedient for that particular kind of personal property so few answer the question relate to they effort to assess movable property that the result be inconclusive only four town indicate that they make any more than a normal effort to list property of this kind of great interest be a question a to whether movable property be assess accord to it location or ownership fifteen state that it be accord to location four by residence of the owner and nineteen do not answer twenty-seven assessor state that they be in favor of improve mean for assess movable personal property and only five be oppose seven other express no opinion on this point there be fairly general agreement that assessor would like to do more than they be do now it be not clear however whether they be think of all movable property or only of boat trailer aircraft or certain other type of personal property whose assessment would be advantageous to they particular town another question that be ask of the assessor be whether they favore the assessment of movable property at it location or at the residence of the owner eighteen vote for assessment by the town in which it be locate and eleven prefer assessment by the town in which the owner reside ten other make no reply of those who have an opinion it seem that assessment by location be prefer there be one vote for location be the place where the property be situate for the great portion of the twelve month precede the assessment date to summarize it may be say that there be no one prevail practice in rhode island with respect to the taxation of movable property that assessor would like to see an improvement and of those who have an opinion that assessment by the town of location be prefer on the basis of they present knowledge the need for great knowledge be evident from they reply boat a personal property tax of boat interest have be show for a number of year by local assessor in the possibility of tax boat assessor in rhode island be charge not only with place a valuation upon real and personal property but they also have the responsibility to raise by a tax a sum not less than nor more than a specify amount a order by a city council or financial town meet it have be obvious to the assessor particularly those in shore community that boat comprise the large category of tangible personal property which they have be unable to reach through they professional organization the rhode island tax official association the question of tax boat long have be debate and discuss no satisfactory solution have be find but this be due more to the difficulty inherent in the problem than to a lack of interest or diligence on the part of the assessor it have be estimate that the value of boat in rhode island water be something in excess of fifty million dollar exclude commercial boat it be obvious that this be a potential and lucrative source of revenue for the assessor of those town where a substantial amount of such property would be subject to taxation it be know that at least five town barrington bristol narragansett newport and westerly place some value on some boat for tax purpose however few be tax and the owner and location of most boat be unknown to the assessor on the date of assessment of town valuation no one really know how many boat there actually be or what they aggregate value may be slightly more than 5000 boat be register with the coast guard prior to the recent passage of the state boat law only a few more than 10000 boat have be register with the division of harbors and river at the end of the 1960 boat season but many have be take out of the water early when the threat of a hurricane bring the season to an early close the assessor association meet at narragansett in september 1960 devote it session to a discussion of the boat problem
