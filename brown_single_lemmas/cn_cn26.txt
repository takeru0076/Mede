battle blue throat who have rule the town with he six-shooter for the last six month certainly have no intention of relinquish he profitable dictatorship it be essential that he should restore he formidable reputation a a rip-roaring ruthless gun-slinger and this be the time-honored wild west method of do it he ride in at the head of sixty trigger-happy and liquor-crazed desperado and take over a livery barn at the entrance to main street the entire length of the street could be rake with rifle fire from this barn any posse ride down the street to demand blue throat s surrender would be wipe out with one deadly burst of fire the law-abiding citizen of petrie have gather inside kaster s store halfway down the street several be fire into the barn when billy tilghman arrive he size up

either dead or injure inside it be the abrupt end of blue throat s dictatorship in petrie though only slightly injure himself the big hoodlum never return to those part to tilghman the incident be just one of a long list of hair-raising smash-em-down adventure on the side of the law which start in 1872 when he be only eighteen year old and do not end till fifty year late when he be shoot dead after warn a drink to be quiet of all the rip-roaring two-fisted tough boy of the old west uncle billy tilghman stand out head and shoulder he be the lawman who survive more gunfight than any other famous gun-slinging character in the book he see the most action beat up more badman with he bare fist break up the most gang and send more murderer to the gallows than any other we marshal who live before or after he for fifty year he gun and ham-like fist shoot hole through and batter the daylight out of the enemy of law and order in the frontier town of the west the deed of countless western bandit and outlaw have be glorify almost to the point of hero-worship but because billy tilghman remain strictly on the side of the law throughout he action-packed career he achievement and the appal risk he take while tame the west have remain almost unsung citizen take the view that a lawman be expect to risk he life on the odd occasion anyway but this fight fury of a man risk it regularly over a period of half a century he come within an ace of be riddle with bullet during he long fight with the doolin gang which terrorize oklahoma in the 1890 s lead by bill doolin these mobster specialize in train robbery but a a sideline they loot store and rob bank make liberal use of they gun bill doolin s ambition it appear be to carve out he name with bullet alongside those of jesse jame and billy the kid and bill tilghman have swear he would stop he tilghman know that some rancher be hand-in-glove with the doolin gang they buy rustle cattle from the outlaw keep he supply with gun and ammunition harbored he man in they house billy decide to set an example by arrest one of the rancher name ed dunn who live at rock fort on a bitterly cold day in january 1895 accompany only by neal

from the chimney which be belch out thick smoke the two lawman halt they wagon about twenty yard from the door wait here neal say tilghman if i do nt come out within half an hour ride back to town and bring out a posse leave he rifle in the wagon tilghman walk up to the door and hammer on it there be no reply so he shove it open with he foot and step inside directly opposite the door be a roar log fire a welcome sight on that bitterly cold day seat near it with he back to the door be the rancher ed dunn hello ed say tilghman the rancher grunt an acknowledgement but do nt move tilghman close the door behind he and walk towards the fire suddenly he see something which make he big heart give a sicken lurch and cause the hair to bristle on the back of he neck along each side of the room be six tiered bunk each one screen off with a curtain and project wickedly through these curtain be the gleam muzzle of six rifle all train on billy tilghman the fight marshal have walk right into a trap and at any moment six slug might slam into he hide think fast tilghman never hesitate for one instant he walk right up to the fire a though blissfully unaware of the gun cover he the man behind they be bill doolin and five of he gang every man a killer cold day say tilghman place he hand behind he and casually present he backside to the fire just drop in to ask where jed hawkins life can nt seem to locate landmark in this snow the rancher be tremble he would nt look tilghman in the face follow the river for five mile he say hoarsely jed s homestead be on the south bank resist the overwhelming temptation to flng himself out of that bristle death-trap tilghman deliberately engage the nervous rancher in trivial conversation for a good ten minute all that time rifle barrel be point unwaveringly at he head and body one false move on he part and he would be a dead man well he announce guess i ll be go now ed and thank for the warmup he strolled back to the door whistle softly hand still clasp behind he he leave the house and almost certain death without even increase he pace and wonder by what remarkable stroke of providence he have be allow to come out alive but he know well enough that those gun would still be train on he back a he walk towards the wagon if he show sign of collect he rifle and go back with he deputy to the ranch he would be shoot down instantly leisurely he climb on to the wagon next to neal word do nt say or do anything he say softly just get out of here without it look a though we re in a hurry that place be crawl with bill doolin and he gang even a he speak those word billy tilghman s life hang on a thread back in the house a hoodlum name red buck sore because billy have be allow to leave unscathed jump from a bunk and swear he be go after he to kill he right then you ll stay right here command bill doolin cover red with he rifle billy tilghman be too good a man to shoot in the back we ll let he go but the fight marshal s fifty-year run of
