since emotional reaction in the high vertebrate depend on individual experience and be arouse in man in addition by complex symbol one would expect that the hypothalamus could be excite from the cortex in experiment with topical application of strychnine on the cerebral cortex the transmission of impulse from the cortex to the hypothalamus be demonstrate moreover the responsiveness of the hypothalamus to nociceptive stimulation be greatly increase under these condition even more complex and obviously cortically induce form of emotional arousal could be elicit in monkey a on see monkey b but not a rabbit in emotional stress a previously extinguish condition reaction be restore in monkey a and be associate with typical sign of emotional excitement include sympathetic discharge it seem to follow that by and large an antagonism exist between the paleo - and the neocortex a far a emotional reactivity be concern and that the balance between the two system determine the emotional responsiveness of the organism in addition the neocortical-hypothalamic relation play a great role in primate a mirsky s interest experiment on the communication of affect demonstrate but even in relatively primitive laboratory animal such a the rat sex activity closely identify with the hypothalamus and the visceral brain be enhance by the neocortex maclean stress correctly the importance of the visceral brain for preservation of the individual and the species a evidence by the influence of the limbic brain include the hypothalamus on emotion relate to fight and flight and also on sexual function it should be add that in man neocortical-hypothalamic interrelation probably play a role in the fusion of emotional process with those underlie perception memory imagination and creativity previous experience be obviously of great importance for the qualitative and quantitative emotional response the visceral brain a well a the neocortex be know to contribute to memory but this topic be beyond the scope of this paper 13 hypothalamic balance and it significance after this brief discussion of neo - paleocortical and cortico-hypothalamic relation let we return once more to the problem of hypothalamic balance and it physiological and pathological significance facilitatory process take place between neocortex and hypothalamus via ascend and descend pathway thus cortico-fugal discharge induce by topical application of strychnine to a minute area in the neocortex summate with spike present in the hypothalamus and cause increase convulsive discharge on the other hand the temporary reduction in hypothalamic excitability through the injection of a barbiturate into the posterior hypothalamus cause a lessen in frequency and amplitude of cortical strychnine spike until the hypothalamic excitability be restore apparently a positive feedback exist between the posterior hypothalamus and the cerebral cortex consequently if for any reason the hypothalamic excitability fall below the physiological level the lessen hypothalamic-cortical discharge lead to a diminish state of activity in the cortex with consequent reduction in the cortico-fugal discharge obviously a vicious cycle develop this tendency can be break either by restore hypothalamic excitability directly or via cortico-hypothalamic pathway it be believe that drug therapy and electroshock involve the former and psychotherapy the latter mechanism before we comment far on these pathological condition we should remember that change in the state of the hypothalamus within physiological limit distinguish sleep from wakefulness thus a low intensity of hypothalamic-cortical discharge prevail in sleep and a high one during wakefulness result in synchronous eeg potential in the former and asynchrony in the latter condition moreover the dominance in parasympathetic action with reciprocal inhibition of the sympathetic at the hypothalamic level induce by it peripheral action the autonomic symptom of sleep and by it action on the cortex a lessen in the reactivity of the sensory and motor apparatus of the somatic nervous system with the dominance of the sympathetic division of the hypothalamus the opposite change occur since electrical stimulation of the posterior hypothalamus produce the effect of wakefulness while stimulation of the anterior hypothalamus induce sleep it may be say that the reactivity of the whole organism be alter by a change in the autonomic reactivity of the hypothalamus similar effect can be induce reflexly via the baroreceptor reflex in man and animal of particular importance be the study of the action of drug in this respect although no drug act exclusively on the hypothalamus or a part of it there be sufficient specificity to distinguish drug which shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side from those which produce a parasympathetic dominance the former comprise analeptic and psychoactive drug the latter the tranquilizers specific difference exist in the action of different drug belong to the same group a for instance between reserpine and chlorpromazine important a these difference be they should not obscure the basic fact that by shift the hypothalamic balance sufficiently to the parasympathetic side we produce depression whereas a shift in the opposite direction cause excitatory effect and eventually maniclike change the emotional state produce by drug influence the cortical potential in a characteristic manner synchrony prevail in the eeg of the experimental animal after administration of tranquilizers but asynchrony after application of analeptic and psychoactive drug the shock therapy act likewise on the hypothalamic balance physiological experiment and clinical observation have show that these procedure influence the hypothalamically control hypophyseal secretion and increase sympathetic discharge they shift the hypothalamic balance to the sympathetic side this explain the beneficial effect of electroshock therapy in certain depression and a shift in the reaction from hypo - to normal reactivity of the sympathetic system a show by the mecholyl test some investigator have find a parallelism between remission and return of the sympathetic reactivity of the hypothalamus to the normal level a indicate by the mecholyl test and conversely between clinical impairment and increase deviation of this test from the norm nevertheless the theory that the determine influence of the hypothalamic balance have a profound influence on the clinical behavior of neuropsychiatric patient have not yet be test on an adequate number of patient the mecholyl and noradrenalin test apply with certain precaution be reliable indicator of this central autonomic balance but for the sake of correlate autonomic and clinical state and of study the effect of certain therapeutic procedure on central autonomic reaction additional test seem to be desirable it be assume that the shift in autonomic hypothalamic balance occur spontaneously in neuropsychiatric patient from the application of certain therapeutic procedure follow the pattern know from the sleep-wakefulness cycle a change in the balance to the parasympathetic side lead in the normal individual to sleep or in special circumstance to cardiovascular collapse or nausea and vomit in both condition the emotional and perceptual sensitivity be diminish but no depression occur such a be see clinically or may be produce in normal person by drug the fundamental difference between physiological and pathological state of parasympathetic and also of sympathetic dominance remain to be elucidate perhaps a clue to these and relate problem lie in the fact that change in the intensity of hypothalamic discharge which be associate with change in it balance lead also to qualitative alteration in reactivity a state of parasympathetic tune of the hypothalamus induce experimentally cause not only an increase in the parsympathetic reactivity of this structure to direct and reflexly induce stimulus but lead also to an autonomic reversal a stimulus act sympathetically under control condition elicit in this state of tune a parasympathetic response furthermore condition reaction be fundamentally alter when the hypothalamic sympathetic reactivity be augment beyond a critical level and several type of behavioral change probably relate to the degree of central autonomic tune be observe if for instance such a change be produce by one or a few insulin coma or electroshocks previously inhibit condition reaction reappear however if these procedure be apply more often condition emotional response be temporarily abolish in other study loss of differentiation in previously establish condition reflex result from repeat convulsive metrazol treatment suggest a fundamental disturbance in the balance between excitatory and inhibitory cerebral process it have far be show that 1 an experimental neurosis in it initial stage be associate with a reversible shift in the central autonomic balance 2 drug alter the hypothalamic balance alter condition reaction 3 in a state of depression the positive condition stimulus may fail to elicit a condition reaction but cause an increase synchrony instead of the excitatory desynchronizing alert effect on the afj these be few and seemingly disjointed data but they illustrate the important fact that fundamental alteration in condition reaction occur in a variety of state in which the hypothalamic balance have be alter by physiological experimentation pharmacological action or clinical process 14 on the physiological basis of some form of psychotherapy the forego remark imply that the hypothalamic balance play a crucial role at the crossroads between physiological and pathological form of emotion if this be the case one would expect that not only the various procedure just mention which alter the hypothalamic balance would influence emotional state and behavior but that emotion itself would act likewise we point out that emotional excitement may lead to psychosomatic disorder and neurotic symptom particularly in certain type of personality but it be also know that the relive of a strong emotion abreaction may cure a battle neurosis this phenomenon raise the question whether the guidance of the emotion for therapeutic end may not have an even wide application in the area of the neurosis be a strictly physiological procedure one may expect from such a study additional information on the nature of the emotional process itself wolpe s experiment and therapeutic work lie in this area he show convincingly that anxiety be a learn condition reaction and be the basis of experimental and clinical neurosis and assume therefore that the neuronal change which underlie the neurosis be functional and reversible an important observation of pavlov serve a a guide post to achieve such a reversibility by physiological mean in a condition experiment he demonstrate the antagonism between feed and pain a mild electrical shock serve a a condition stimulus and be follow by feed the pain become thus the symbol for food and elicit salivary secretion condition reflex even when the intensity of the shock be increase gradually it fail to evoke any sign of pain since strong nociceptive stimulus produce an experimental neurosis during which the animal fail to eat in the experimental situation wolpe think that he could utilize the feeding-pain antagonism to inhibit the neurotic symptom through feed appropriate experiment show that this be indeed possible he then apply this principle of reciprocal inhibition to human neurosis he take advantage of the antagonism between aggressive assertiveness and anxiety and find a relatively rapid disappearance of anxiety when the former attitude be establish for the interpretation of these significant investigation it should be remember that reciprocal relation exist in the hypothalamus with respect to autonomic and somatic function which be closely associate with the emotion the feeding-pain antagonism seem to be base on this reciprocal relation between the tropho - and ergotropic system furthermore a functional antagonism exist between an aggressive attitude and a state of anxiety although in both emotion sympathetic symptom be present different autonomic-somatic pattern underlie aggression and anxiety respectively a indicate by the rate of the excretion of the catecholamine the state of the muscle tone and the mecholyl test the psychological incompatibility of these emotional state seem to be reflect in or base on this mark difference 15 conclude remark in we attempt to interpret the emotion in they physiological and pathological range we emphasize the importance of the degree of activity of the parasympathetic and sympathetic division of the hypothalamic system and they influence on the inhibitory and excitatory system respectively we stress the reciprocal relation of these system with respect to the autonomic-somatic downward discharge a well a regard the hypothalamic-cortical discharge although we be still far from a complete understand of these problem a a first approximation it be suggest that alteration in the hypothalamic balance with consequent change in the hypothalamic-cortical discharge account for major change in behavior see in various mood and state of emotion in man and beast under physiological circumstance in experimental and clinical neurosis and a the result of psychopharmacological agent in view of the important role which emotional disturbance play in the genesis of neurotic and psychotic disorder and the parallelism observe between autonomic state and psychological behavior in several instance it be far suggest that a hypothalamic imbalance may play an important role in initiate mental change
