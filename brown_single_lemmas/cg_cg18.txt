and enigmatic figure of charles 12 the true hero be not finally the king himself hence the title of the book refer to the soldier and subject of the king on the fatal battlefield of poltava to quote from the novel the wreath he twine for himself slip down upon he people the charles man consist not of a connect narrative but of a group of short story each depict a special phase of the general

this more true than of heidenstam the charles man have a tremendous range of character of common folk even more than of major figure the career of charles 12 be obviously very similar to that of napoleon he ideal be alexander of macedon a napoleon s be julius caesar he purpose however be not to establish an empire but to assert the principle of divine justice each aspire to be a god in human form but with each it be a different kind of god each fail catastrophically in an invasion of russia and each bring ruin on the country that worship he each be still glorify a a national hero the first half of the charles man end on the climax of the battle of poltava in 1709 be more dramatically coherent than the second after the collapse of that desperate and ill-fated campaign the character of the king degenerate for a time into a futility that be not merely pitiable but often ridiculous like napoleon he be the bad of loser there be however some wonderful chapter at the begin of the second part concern the reaction of the swede in adversity then more than ever before do they show they fortitude and patient cheerfulness this come out in when the bell ring which describe the rally of the peasant in southern sweden to repel an invasion by the dane in the king s ride charles break out of a long period of petulance and inertia regain he old self escape from turkey and finally
