for here if anywhere in contemporary literature be a major effort to counterbalance existentialism and restore some of it former lustre to the tarnish image of the species man or a malraux himself put it to make man conscious of the grandeur they ignore in themselves 1 andre malraux s the walnut tree of altenburg be write in the early year of the second world war during a period of enforce leisure when he be take prisoner by the german after the fall of france the manuscript presumably after be smuggle out of the country be publish in switzerland in 1943 the work a it stand be not the entire book that malraux write at that time it be only the first section of a three-part novel call la lutte avec lange and this first section be somehow preserve there be always these annoy little mystery about the actual fact of malraux s life when the gestapo destroy the rest if we be to believe the list of title print in malraux s late book la metamorphose des dieux vol 1 1957 he be still engage in write a large novel under he original title but a he remark in he preface to the walnut tree a novel can hardly ever be rewrite and when this one appear in it final form the form of the first part will no doubt be radically change malraux pretend perhaps with a trifle too self-conscious a modesty that he fragmentary work will accordingly appeal only to the curiosity of bibliophile and to connoisseur of what might have be even in it present form however the first part of malraux s unrecoverable novel be among the great work of mid-twentieth century literature and it should be far good know than it be the theme of the walnut tree of altenburg be most closely relate to it immediate predecessor in malraux s array of novel man s hope 1937 this magnificent but greatly underestimate book which body forth the very form and pressure of it time a no other comparable creation have suffer severely from have be write about an historical event the spanish civil war that be still capable of fan the smoldering fire of old political feud even so apparently impartial a critic a wh frohock have take for grant that the book be originally intend a a piece of loyalist propaganda and have then go on to argue with unimpeachable consistency that all the obviously non-propagandistic aspect of the book be simply inadvertent contradiction nothing however could be far from the truth the whole purpose of man s hope be to portray the tragic dialectic between mean and end inherent in all organize political violence and even when such violence be a necessary and legitimate self-defense of liberty justice and human dignity nowhere before in malraux s page have we meet such impassioned defender of a quality of man which transcend the realm of politics and even the realm of action altogether both the action of malraux s early anarchist-adventurers like perken and garine and the self-sacrificing action of dedicate communist like kyo gisors and katow in man s fate man engage only a small part of himself in an action say old alvear the art-historian and the more the action claim to be total the small be the part of man engage these line never cease to haunt the book amidst all the exaltation of combat and to make an appeal for a large and more elemental human community than one base on the brutal necessity of war it be this large theme of the quality of man a quality that transcend the ideological and flow into the human which now form the pulsate heart of malraux s artistic universe malraux to be sure do not abandon the world of violence combat and sudden death which have become he hallmark a a creative artist and which be the only world apparently in which he imagination can flame into life the walnut tree of altenburg include not one war but two and throw in a turkish revolution along with some guerrilla fight in the desert for good measure but while war still serve a a catalyst for the value that malraux wish to express these value be no long link with the triumph or defeat of any cause whether that of an individual assertion of the will-to-power or a collective attempt to escape from the humiliation of oppression a they necessary condition on the contrary the frenzy and furor of combat be only the sombre foil against which the sudden illumination of the human flash forth with the pierce radiance of a caravaggio 2 the walnut tree of altenburg be compose in the form of a triptych with the two small side panel frame and enclose the main central episode of the novel this central episode consist of a series of staccato scene set in the period from the begin of the present century up to the first world war the frame scene on the other hand both take place in the late spring of 1940 just at the moment of the defeat of france in the second great world conflict the narrator be an alsatian serve with the french army and he have the same name berger that malraux himself be late to use in the resistance like malraux he be also serve in the tank corps before be capture and we learn a well that in civilian life he have be a writer these biographical analogy be obvious and far too much time have be spend speculate on they possible implication much more important be to grasp the feeling of the narrator whose full name be never give a he become aware of the disorganize and bewilder mass of french prisoner cluster together in a temporary prison camp in and around the cathedral of chartres for a he companion gradually dissolve back into a state of primitive confrontation with elemental necessity a they lose all the appanage of they acquire culture he be overcome by the feel that he be at last be confront with the essence of mankind a a writer by what have i be obsess these last ten year if not by mankind here i be face to face with the primeval stuff the intuition about mankind convey in these open page be of crucial importance for understand the remainder of the text and we must attend to it more closely than have usually be do what do the narrator see and what do he feel a good many page of the first section be take up with an account of the dog determination of the prisoner to write to they wife and family even when it become clear that the german be simply allow the letter to blow away in the wind awkwardly and laboriously in stiff unemotional phrase the soldier continue to bridge the distance between themselves and those they love they instinctively struggle to keep open a road to the future in they heart and by a skillful and unobtrusive use of imagery the enclosure be call a roman-camp stockade the hastily erect lean-to be a babylonian hovel the man begin to look like peruvian mummy and to acquire gothic face malraux project a fresco of human endurance which be also the endurance of the human stretch backward into the dark abyss of time the narrator feel himself catch a glimpse of pre-history learn of man s age-old familiarity with misfortune a well a he equally age-old ingenuity he secret faith in endurance however cram with catastrophe the same faith perhaps a the cave-men use to have in the face of famine this new vision of man that the narrator acquire be also accompany by a re-vision of he previous view i think i know more than i education have teach i note the narrator because i have encounter the militant mob of a political or religious faith be this not malraux himself allude to he own early infatuation with the ideological but now he know that an intellectual be not only a man to whom book be necessary he be any man whose reason however elementary it may be affect and direct he life from this point of view the militant mob of the past stir into action by one ideology or another be all compose of intellectual and this be not the level on which the essence of mankind can be discover the man around he observe the narrator have be live from day to day for thousands of year the human be deep than a mass ideology certainly deep than the isolate individual and the narrator recall the word of he father vincent berger it be not by any amount of scratch at the individual that one finally come down to mankind the entire middle section of the walnut tree be take up with the life of vincent berger himself whose fragmentary note on he encounter with mankind be now convey by he son he be not much old than myself write the narrator when he begin to feel the impact of that human mystery which now obsess i and which make i begin perhaps to understand he for the figure of vincent berger malraux have obviously draw on he study of te lawrence though berger fight on the side of the turk instead of against they and like both lawrence and malraux himself he be a fervent admirer of nietzsche a professor at the university of constantinople where he first course of lecture be on nietzsche and the philosophy of action vincent berger become head of the propaganda department of the german embassy in turkey a an alsatian before the first world war he be of course of german nationality but he quickly involve himself in the young turk revolutionary movement to such an extent that he own country begin to doubt he patriotism and after become the right-hand man of enver pasha he be send by the latter to pave the way for a new turkish empire embrace the union of all turk throughout central asia from adrianople to the chinese oasis on the silk trade route vincent berger s mission be a failure because the ottoman nationalism on which enver pasha count do not exist central asia be sink in a somnolence from which nothing can awaken it and amid a dusty desolation in which nothing human any long seem to survive vincent berger begin to dream of the occident oh for the green of europe train whistle in the night the rattle and clatter of cab finally after almost be beat to death by a madman he could not fight back because madman be sacred to islam he throw up he mission and return to europe this have be he first encounter with mankind and although he have now become a legendary figure in the popular european press it leave he profoundly dissatisfied despite berger s report enver pasha refuse to surrender he dream of a turkish blood alliance and vincent berger learn that political ambition be more apt to hide than to reveal the truth about man but a he discover shortly on return among intellectual obsess by le culte do moi he experience of action have also teach he a more positive lesson for six year i father have have to do too much command and convince write the narrator not to understand that man begin with the other and when vincent berger return to europe this first result of he encounter with mankind be considerably enrich and deepen by a crucial revelation for a dawn sense of illumination occur in consequence of two event which a so often in malraux suddenly confront a character with the existential question of the nature and value of human life one such event be the land in europe itself when the mingle familiarity and strangeness of the occident after the blank immensity of asia shock the return traveller into a realization of the infinite possibility of human life
