demand within 48 hour the we have to reduce it embassy and consulate staff in cuba to a total of eleven person the embassy staff alone totale 87 we citizen plus 120 cuban employee president eisenhower hold an 830 be meet with top military and foreign-policy adviser decide to break off diplomatic relation immediately there be a limit to what the unite state in self-respect can endure say the president that limit have now be reach through secretary herter ike offer president-elect kennedy an opportunity to associate he new administration with the breakoff decision kennedy through secretary-designate of state dean rusk decline he thus keep he hand free for any action after jan 20 although reaction to the break be generally favorable in the we and latin america see the hemisphere 2 laos after a white house huddle between the president and top lieutenant the defense department react sharply to a cry from the pro-western government of laos that several battalion of communist troop have invade laos from north viet nam in view of the present situation in laos say the pentagon s announcement we be take normal precautionary action to increase the readiness of we force in the pacific cut short a holiday at hong kong the aircraft carrier lexington and bennington steam off into the south china sea accompany by a swarm of destroyer plus troopship load with marine on the we s island base of okinawa task force 116 make up of army navy marine and air force unit get brace to move southward on signal but by week s end the laotian cry of invasion be read a an exaggeration see foreign news and the we be agree with it cautious british and french ally that a neutralist rather than a pro-western government might be good for laos french & indian there be a moral of sort in the laotian situation that say much about all other cold-war front political economic and military expert be all agree that chaotic mountainous little laos be the last place in the world to fight a war and they be probably right it would be like fight the french and indian war all over again say one military man but why be laos the new southeast asian battleground at geneva in 1954 to get the war in indo-china settle the british and french give in to russian and communist chinese demand and agree to the set up of a communist state north viet nam which then predictably become a base for communist operation against neighboring south viet nam and laos the late secretary of state john foster dulles consider the 1954 geneva agreement a specimen of appeasement see that resolution would be need to keep it from become a calamity for the west he begin the diplomatic discussion that result in the establishment of afj the important thing from now on he say be not to mourn the past but to seize the future opportunity to prevent the loss in northern viet nam from lead to the extension of communism throughout southeast asia russian tank and artillery parade through the street of havana russian intrigue in the congo and russian arm drop in laos use the same ilyushin transport that be use to carry communist agent to the congo make it plain once more that the cold war be all of a piece in space and time soviet premier khrushchev send new year s hope for peace to president-elect kennedy and get a cool acknowledgment in reply consider the state of the whole world the cold war s three expose front do not seem terribly ominous but in senator gore s word it be not a very encourage situation that would confront john f kennedy on inauguration day the congress turmoil in the house a the 87th congress begin it session last week liberal democrat be ready for a finish fight to open the sluice gate control by the house rule committee and permit the free flow of liberal legislation to the floor the liberal pressure bloc which coyly masquerade under the name democratic study group have fight the committee before and have always lose this time they be much good prepare and organize and the political climate be favorable they have the unspoken support of president-elect kennedy whose own legislative program be menace by the rule committee bottleneck and count nose they seem to have the vote to work they will deadly deadlock there be two possible method of breach the conservative barrier around the rule committee 1 to pack it with additional liberal and break the conservative-liberal deadlock or 2 to remove one of the conservative namely mississippi s 14-term william meyers colmer pronounce calm caucusing the liberal decide to go after colmer which actually be the more drastic course since seniority in the house be next to godliness a dour gangling man with a choppy gait colmer look young than he 70 year have gradually swing from a moderate internationalist position to that of a diehard conservative he be generally and initially suspicious of any federal project unless it happen to benefit he gulf coast constituent he be of course a segregationist but he say he have never make an anti-negro speech for 20 year he have enjoy he power on the rule committee there he vote along with those of chairman howard smith the courtly virginia judge and the four republican member could and often do produce a 6-6 deadlock that block far-out democratic-sponsored welfare legislation a tactic often acceptable to the rayburn-johnson congressional leadership to avoid embarrass vote equal treatment there be sufficient pretext to demand colmer s ouster he have give he lukewarm support to the anti-kennedy elector in mississippi reprisal be not unheard of in such situation but the recent tendency have be for the congress to forgive it prodigal son in 1949 the dixiecrats escape unscathed after they 1948 rebellion against harry truman and in 1957 after congressman adam clayton powell campaign for dwight eisenhower in 1956 he fellow democrat do not touch he committee assignment although they do strip he temporarily of he patronage in the heat of the anti-colmer drive last week judge smith threaten reprisal against powell say he we will see whether white and negroes be treat the same around here but speaker sam rayburn after huddle in palm beach with president-elect kennedy decide that this year something have to be do about the rule committee and that he be the only man who could do anything effective in a tense closed-door session with judge smith rayburn attempt to work out a compromise to add three new member to the rule committee two democrat include one southerner and one republican smith flatly reject the offer and mister sam thereupon decide to join the rebel the next morning he summon a group of top democrat to he private office and break the news he would lead the fight to oust colmer whom he be say to regard a an inferior man news of rayburn s commitment soon leak out when missouri s clarence cannon get the word he turn purple unconscionable he shout and rush off to the speaker s room to object a dangerous precedent cannon a powerful conservative man bring welcome support to the smith-colmer force a chairman of the appropriation committee he hold over each member the dreadful threat of exclude this or that congressional district from federal pork-barrel project sit quietly on an equally big pork barrel be another judge smith ally georgia s carl vinson chairman of the arm service committee threat of war a the battle rage in the cloakroom and caucuses it become clear that judge smith could lose he high count of supporter number 72 and he need nearly twice that number to control the 260-member democratic caucus the liberal smell blood be face with the necessity of win three big vote in the democratic committee on committee in the full party caucus and on the floor of the house before they could oust colmer one big question if colmer be to be purge what should the house do about the other three senior mississippians who support the maverick elector in all three arena they seem certain of victory especially with sam rayburn apply he whiplash but in the prospect of win the battle loom the specter of lose a costly war if the southerner be sufficiently arouse they could very well cut the kennedy legislative program to ribbon from they vantage point of committee chairmanship leave sam rayburn lead a truncate unworkable party with that possibility in mind arkansas wilbur mill deliberately delay call a meet of the committee on committee and coolheaded democrat seek to bring rayburn and smith together again to work out some sort of face-saving compromise here be two old man mad at each other and too proud to pick up the phone say a house democratic leader one want a little more power and the other do nt want to give up any battle in the senate the senate launch the 87th congress with it own version of an ancient liberal-conservative battle but in contrast with the house s guerrilla war it seem a pro forma a a capitol guide s speech question at issue how big a vote should be necessary to restrict senate debate and thereby cut off legislation-delaying filibuster a wide-ranging bipartisan force from minnesota s democratic hubert humphrey to massachusetts republican leverett saltonstall be draw up against a solid phalanx of southern democrat who have traditionally use the filibuster to stop civil right bill new mexico s clint anderson offer a resolution to change the senate s notorious rule 22 to allow three-fifth of the senator present and vote to cut off debate instead of the current hard-to-get two-third fair dealer humphrey up the ante ask cloture power for a mere majority of senator georgia s dick russell object politely and the battle be join privately the liberal admit that the humphrey amendment have no chance of passage privately they also admit that they hope for clint anderson s three-fifth modification depend on none other than republican richard nixon in 1957 nixon deliver a significant opinion that a majority of senator have the power to adopt new rule at the begin of each new congress and that any rule lay down by previous congress be not bind arm with the nixon opinion the senate liberal round up they slim majority and prepare to choke off debate on the filibuster battle this week hopefully the perennial battle of rule 22 then would be fight to a settlement once and for all republican last act since election day vice president richard nixon have virtually retire by he own wish from public view but with the conven of the new congress he be the public man again preside over the senate until john kennedy s inauguration one day last week nixon face a painful constitutional chore that require he to officiate at a joint session of congress to hear the official tally of the electoral college vote and then to make sufficient declaration of the election of the man who defeat he in the tight 1960 presidential election nixon fulfil he assignment with grace then go beyond the require sufficient declaration this be the first time in 100 year that a candidate for the presidency announce the result of an election in which he be defeat he say
