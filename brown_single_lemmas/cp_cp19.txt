i do nt really believe in intuition but i swear to you from the moment i open i eye i know it be go to be a bad day part of it be the weather so foggy it would take i twice a long to get to the hospital part of it be be so tire i d not only have i usual full day yesterday but a dinner meet a well that keep i up late but the rest of it the main part be nt base on logic at all it be just go to be one of those day for the thousandth time i wish i d choose some nice nine-to-five five-days-a-week profession and for the thousandth time i answer myself i have nt choose medicine it have choose i actually i should nt complain i tell myself in the shave mirror i have a lot to be thankful for a profession that bring i a good an income a i be nt to be sneeze at maybe i do nt see a much of gladdy a i d like but how much bad it would have be if i d have to board she out somewhere after alice go send i daughter to an orphanage or a boarding-home at least we be together and we have mrs hodges bless she to look after we no mother could be fond of gladdy than mrs hodges be i be lucky in lot of way no doubt about it especially in the way gladdy have turn out grow up without a mother from the time she be three it be nt a good thing for a child even know the kind of mother alice have be but i must nt start on alice she be a close book a picture i keep on i bureau but never look at if she d keep on a she d be go the story i d tell gladdy would probably have be true by now anyhow a usual gladdy s bright smile greet i at the breakfast table she first class be nt until ten but she always get up to have breakfast with i it make i feel good and know that she d decide all on she own to go to college right here in town make i feel good too oh i know that i could nt give myself all the credit for she decision i have a feel that young pete michelson the most promise intern at fairview have something to do with it too she d be out with pete the night before and she gay chatter about they date lighten i mood a little but once i be alone again drive to the hospital the heaviness return if she and pete be really get serious i d have to do some hard think should i tell he the truth about alice do he have a right to know the secret i d keep from gladdy all these year the boy be already wait in the corridor outside i office when i get to fairview two intern and dick ishii the other resident i m chief of medicine here and this morning would start like all other with i take the boy on the round pete be down on seven dick tell i and he d meet we there there be nt anything of special interest that morning no one sick than they should have be pete come to meet we when we step out of the elevator on seven he d have a case of post-operative shock but it be all take care of now seven be a woman s floor and a it happen not very busy right then when we d finish we regular round pete point i toward the small ward at the end of the floor get a new one in last night he say i have nt see she yet but i hear she s a lulu i be nt surprise the ward be a small one four bed keep reserve for female alcoholic we do nt get many at fairview and they be never pretty sight it be think wise to keep they segregate from the patient in the regular charity ward the moment i walk in the whole miserable feel of the day seem to focus on the woman in the bed they d clean she up some of course and she d pretty much sleep off she drink but there be something about she and i feel i lip form a name alice but this woman s name be rise bancroft i look at the chart for reassurance yes rise bancroft diagnosis acute alcoholism she look about sixty though i recall that the chart give she age a forty-four an ugly scar disfigure the somewhat familiar puffy face already mar by the tell-tale network of break red vein that heavy drinker carry she coarse hair be two-colored bleach blonde and it real dirty gray oh could it be no no it be an unfortunate resemblance that be all it be and i turn to dick force myself to put i disquiet out of i mind in a low voice dick fill we in she d be pick up downtown pass out in the doorway although quiet when they bring she in she d suddenly turn violent and have to be knock out it be the old story we d keep she a day or two and the aa people would talk to she but if she be nt interest she d just go back to the same life she d leave turn toward the patient again i i can nt describe what happen to i then except to say that i feel sick i tell you it take every ounce of control i have to be able to speak now miss or be it mrs bancroft i never like go straight into an examination with patient it relax they i ve always think to chat first this be one time i d have gladly break i own rule but habit be too strong hey she voice be flat and dull but those penetrate eye i have to turn i head away it be then that i see what the drawn-back cover reveal there be bloodspots on the sheet what s this i ask you period she shake she head i be spot a little now and then she say quietly no emotion in she voice have you speak to a doctor about it once again there be a negative shake i tell miss groggins to move she down the hall where we have an examine table good do a papanicolaou i tell pete it be only a few moment before miss groggins have she in the proper position for a vaginal but i could nt see anything wrong on gross examination pete stand by with a slide and take the smear send it down to the lab with a request for the test that do i tell miss groggins to take she patient back to bed and again put she out of i mind i be busy the rest of the day late in the afternoon i be up on seven again one of i private patient be be admit and i go in to see she settle on i way to the elevator i run into pete i ve get the result on the bancroft smear test he say there s something there all right class three they say do you want to talk to she doctor well i do nt i do nt ever want to see that woman again but that be ridiculous of course all right we ll do a d and c and get she permission for a hysterectomy maybe it s nothing maybe it s intraepithelial or in situ can nt take any chance if you can keep she here that long pete say wryly groggins tell i she s start badger already want to get out want to get to she booze i guess i grimace in distaste well good see what i can do we d be stand right outside miss bancroft s door and a i go to turn the knob to enter i be surprise to find that the door be slightly ajar but she seem to be doze and in any case we d be talk in low tone she eye open a soon a she hear i though and once again i feel an inward shiver i sure can nt complain about the service in this place she say i just get through see one of you guy what do you want there be something almost insult in she tone but i disregard it i ve just be talk to dr michelson i say we d like you to have a dilatation and curettage that s quite minor nothing to worry about but we would like you permission to do that be to go far if it prove necessary no it be flat definite suppose you let i explain actually i rather doubt that we ll have to do this even if we do you ll be out of here in a week probably i be sure that be the difficulty she just do nt want to stay here where she could nt get to the liquor no i look at she in amazement i d have patient who d refuse surgery before of course but never one who do nt show in one way or another the reason why mostly it be fear but this woman s voice do nt tremble and she hand be still on the coverlet will you tell i why i ask she smile a smile without humor you should nt tell you little secret outside of the patient s door she say i ve get cancer have nt i she go on disregard i protest i m not go to be one of you guinea pig let you pupil learn on someone else doctor just let i die in peace i stare at she almost speechless she little speech be totally out of character with the sort of person i think she be even she voice have take on a more cultivate tone this be someone who d come down in the world i think a long long way down again there be something familiar about she something you have nt get cancer i say a strongly a i could i do nt know what you hear that would make you think so but i assure you i do nt even know myself so how can you be so sure and even if do nt give i a lot of talk joe i gape at she she could have find out i first name of course that would nt be difficult but there be that something some echo in the way she speak she be watch i intently a funny little half-smile on she lip surprise baby guess i ve change have nt i but you have nt change much joe i know then know with a heart-stopping shock alice i stammer through dry lip alice for goodness sake alice she echo mockingly what s the matter joe you scare of i think i m go to make you introduce a drink a you wife well do nt worry just let i outta here but why do you come back i d find i voice where have you be all these year she shrug here and there a for come back here well i ll tell you the truth i do nt even know where i be when i come to the last thing i remember be a bar in san diego the way she speak she flat acceptance of she alcoholic blackout make i shudder and this be gladdy s mother i never ask you for any favor joe she go on but i m ask one now let i outta here you doctor be all alike all you want be to cut up people and what s the good no i want out joe i look at the pathetic wreck of a woman before i let she out let she out that would be the solution would nt it what she d say be true in all these year she d never ask for anything from i if i let she go she d disappear once more and gladdy would be safe
