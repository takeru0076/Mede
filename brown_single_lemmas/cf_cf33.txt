in a few school district one find a link between school and job in those vocational program organize with smith-hughes money there may be a close tie between the labor union and a local employer on the one hand and the vocational teacher on the other in these case a graduate may enter directly into an apprentice program save a year because of he vocational course in grade 11 and 12 the apprentice program will involve far education on a part-time basis usually at night perhaps use some of the same equipment of the high school these opportunity be to be find in certain city in such craft a auto mechanic carpentry draft electrical work tool-and-die work and sheet-metal work formally organize vocational program support by federal fund allow high school student to gain experience in a field of work which be likely to lead to a full-time job on graduation the diversify occupation program be a part-time trade-preparatory program conduct over two school year on a cooperative basis between the school and local industrial and business employer the distributive education program operate in a similar way with arrangement between the school and employer in merchandise field in both case the student attend school half-time and work in a regular job the other half he receive remuneration for he work in a few place cooperative program between school and employer in clerical work have show the same possibility for allow the student while still in school to develop skill which be immediately marketable upon graduation adult education course work-study program of various sort these be all evidence of a continue interest of the school in further educational opportunity for out-of-school youth in general however it may be say that when a boy or a girl leave the high school the school authority play little or no part in the decision of what happen next if the student drop out of high school the break with the school be even more complete when there be employment opportunity for youth this arrangement or lack of arrangement work out quite well indeed in some period of we history and in some neighborhood the job opportunity have be so good that undoubtedly a great many boy who be potential member of the profession quit school at an early age and go to work statistically this have represent a loss to the nation although one must admit that in an individual case the decision in retrospect may have be a wise one i make no attempt to measure the endure satisfaction and material well-being of a man who go to work on graduation from high school and be highly successful in the business which he enter he may or may not be good off than he classmate who go on to a college and professional school but in the next decade the nation need to educate for the profession all the potential professional talent in a late chapter deal with the suburban school i shall discuss the importance of arrange a program for the academically talent and highly gift youth in any high school where he be find in the negro neighborhood and also to some extent in the mix neighborhood the problem may be one of identification and motivation high motivation towards high education must start early enough so that by the time the boy or girl reach grade 9 he or she have at least develop those basic skill which be essential for academic work undoubtedly far more can be do in the low grade in this regard in the negro school however the teacher can only go so far if the attitude of the community and the family be anti-intellectual and the fact remain that there be today few shine example of negroes in position of intellectual leadership this be not due to any policy of discrimination on the part of the northern university quite the contrary a i can testify from personal experience a a former university president rather we see here another vicious circle the absence of successful negroes in the world of scholarship and science have tend to tamp down enthusiasm among negro youth for academic career i believe the situation be improve but the success story need to be heavily publicize here again we run into the roadblock that negroes do not like to be designate a negroes in the press how can the vicious circle be break this be a problem to which leader of opinion both negro and white should devote far more attention it be at least a important a the more dramatic attempt to break down barrier of inequality in the south vocational education i should like to underline four point i make in i first report with respect to vocational education first and foremost vocational course should not replace course which be essential part of the require academic program for graduation second vocational course should be provide in grade 11 and 12 and not require more than half the student s time in those year however for slow learner and prospective dropout these course ought to begin early third the significance of the vocational course be that those enrol be keenly interest in the work they realize the relevance of what they be learn to they future career and this sense of purpose be carry over to the academic course which they be study at the same time fourth the type of vocational train program should be relate to the employment opportunity in the general locality this last point be important because if high school pupil be aware that few if any graduate who have choose a certain vocational program have obtain a job a a consequence of the train the whole idea of relevance disappear vocational train which hold no hope that the skill develop will be in fact a marketable skill become just another school chore for those whose interest in they study have begin to falter those who because of population mobility and the repute desire of employer to train they own employee would limit vocational education to general rather than specific skill ought to bear in mind the importance of motivation in any kind of school experience i have be use the word vocational a a layman would at first sight think it should be use i intend to include under the term all the practical course open to boy and girl these course develop skill other than those we think of when we use the adjective academic practically all of these practical skill be of such a nature that a degree of mastery can be obtain in high school sufficient to enable the youth to get a job at once on the basis of the skill they be in this sense skill marketable immediately on graduation from high school to be sure in tool-and-die work and in the build trade the first job must be often on an apprentice basis but two year of half-time vocational train enable the young man thus to anticipate one year of apprentice status similarly a girl who graduate with a good work knowledge of stenography and the use of clerical machine and who be able to get a job at once may wish to improve she skill and knowledge by a year or two of far study in a community college or secretarial school of course it can be argue that an ability to write english correctly and with some degree of elegance be a marketable skill so too be the mathematical competence of a college graduate who have majore in mathematics in a sense almost all high school and college course could be consider a vocational to the extent that late in life the student in he vocation which may be a profession will be call upon to use some of the skill develop and the competence obtain in spite of the shade of one type of course into another i believe it be useful to talk about vocational course a apart from academic course perhaps a course in typewriting might be regard a the exception which prove the rule today many college bind student try to take a course in personal type a they feel a certain degree of mastery of this skill be almost essential for one who propose to do academic work in college and a professional school most of we large city have one or more separate vocational or technical high school in this respect public education in the large city differ from education in the small city and consolidate school district the neighborhood high school be not strictly speak comprehensive school because some of the boy and girl may be attend a vocational or technical high school instead of the local school indeed one school superintendent in a large city object to the use of the term comprehensive high school for the senior high school in he city because these school do not offer strictly vocational program he prefer to designate such school a general high school the suburban high school it be worth note also be not a widely comprehensive high school because of the absence of vocational program the reason be that there be a lack of interest on the part of the community therefore employment and education in all the school in a metropolitan area be relate in different way from those which be characteristic of the comprehensive high school describe in i first report the separate vocational or technical high school in the large city must be reckon a permanent institution by and large they program be satisfactorily connect both to the employment situation and to the reality of the apprentice system it be not often realize to what degree certain trade be in many community close area of employment except for a lucky few one have to talk confidentially with some of the director of vocational high school to realize that a boy can not just say i want to be a plumber and then by do good work find a job it be far more difficult in many community to obtain admission to an apprentice program which involve union approval than to get into the most selective medical school in the nation two story will illustrate what i have in mind one vocational instructor in a city vocational school speak of he course in a certain field say he have no difficulty place all student in job outside of the city in the city he say the wait list for those who want to join the union be so long that unless a boy have an inside track he can nt get in in a far distant part of the unite state i be talk to an instructor about a boy who in the twelfth grade be do special work what do he have in mind to do when he graduate oh he ll be a plumber come the answer but be nt it almost impossible to get into the union i ask he ll have no difficulty i be tell he have very good connection in i view there should be a school which offer significant vocational program for boy within easy reach of every family in a city ideally these school should be so locate that one or more should be in the area where demand for practical course be at the high an excellent example of a successful location of a new vocational high school be the dunbar vocational high school in chicago locate in a bad slum area now undergo redevelopment this school and it program be especially tailor to the vocational aim of it student hardly a window have be break since dunbar first be open and vandalism in school be a major problem in many slum area i discover in the course of a visit there that almost all the pupil be negroes they be learn trade a diverse a shoe repair bricklaying carpentry cabinet make auto mechanic and airplane mechanic the physical facility at dunbar be impressive but more impressive be the attitude of the pupil
