they would not be please to have it publish back home that they plan a frolic in paris or hong kong at the treasury s expense they would be particularly displease with the state department if it be the source of such report few thing be more perilous for the state department than a displease congressman the reason for this bear explain for those who may wonder why state spend so much of it diplomatic energy on congress when the russian be so available first the state department be unique among government agency for it lack of public supporter the farmer may be arouse if congress cut into the agriculture department s budget businessman will rise if congress attack the commerce department labor restrain undue brutality toward the labor department the chamber of commerce assault upon the treasury a kaleidoscope of pressure group make it unpleasant for the congressman who become ugly toward the department of health education and welfare the congressman s patriotism be always involve when he turn upon the defense department tamper with the post office may infuriate every voter who can write with all these agency the congressman must constantly check the political wind and trim he sail accordingly no such political restraint subdue he blood when he gaze upon the state department in anger in many section he may even reap applause from press and public for give it a good lesson after all the money dispense by state go not to the farmer the laborer or the businessman but to foreigner not only do these foreigner not vote for american congressman they be also probably ungrateful for uncle s sam s bounty and be not the state department man who dispense this largesse merely crackpot and do-gooder who have never meet a payroll will not the righteous congressman be cheer at the poll if he remind they to get right with america and if he save the taxpayer some money by spoil a few of they scheme the chance be excellent that he will the result be that the state department s perpetual position before congress be the resign pose of the whip boy who expect to be kick whenever the master have have a dyspeptic outing with he wife people in this position do not offend the master by relate he peccadilloes to the newspaper state keep the junketeering list a secret the department expect and receive no thank from congress for it discretion congress be a harsh master state be expect to arrange the tour cicero s foreign itinerary it embassy be expect to supply he with ream of local money to pay he way embassy worker be expect to entertain he accord to he whim frequently with they saving for the child s college tuition but come the next session of congress state can expect only that it summer guest will bite it hand when it go to the capitol ask money for diplomatic entertain expense abroad or for live expense for it diplomat the congressman who in paris may have stuff he wallet with enough franc note to paper the roof of notre-dame will systematically scream that a $ 200 increase in entertainment allowance for a second secretary be tantamount to debauchery of the treasury in the matter of money state s most unrelenting watchdog during the eisenhower year be representative john j rooney of brooklyn who control the purse for diplomatic administrative expense diplomat stay up night think of way to attain peaceful coexistence not with nikita khrushchev but with john rooney nothing work in the most confidential whisper ambassador tell of technique they have try to bring rooney around friendly persuasion groveling abasement pressure subtly exert through other powerful congressman tale of heartbreak and penury among a threadbare diplomatic corps rooney remain untouched the trouble explain loy henderson then deputy undersecretary for administration be that when we get into an argument with he about this thing it always turn out that rooney know more about we budget than we do one year the department collect a file of case history to document it argument that man in the field be pay the government s entertainment bill out of personal income news of the project reach the press next day report go through the department that rooney have be outraged by what he consider a patent attempt to put public pressure on he for increase entertainment allowance and have swear an oath that that year expense allowance would not rise a dollar they do nt the department s constant fight with the house for money be a polite minuet compare with it periodic bloody engagement with the senate arm with constitutional power to negate the executive s foreign policy the senate carry a big stick and be easily provoke to use it on the state department s back or on the head of the secretary of state with it power to investigate the senate can paralyze the secretary by keep he in a state of perpetual testimony before committee a it do with dean acheson john foster dulles escape by keep he personal show on the road and because lyndon johnson who be then operate the senate refuse to let it become an inquisition during dulles s first two year in office while republican run the senate the department be at the mercy of man who have thirst for it blood since 1945 an internal police operation manage by scott mcleod a former fbi man install a security officer upon congressional insistence be part of the vengeance so be the attack upon charles e bohlen when eisenhower appoint he ambassador to moscow the principal mauler however be senator joseph mccarthy where acheson have fight a gallant lose battle for the department dulles feed the crocodile with he subordinate fret privately but eschew public defense of he terrorize bureaucrat dulles remain serene and detach while the hatchet man have they way in view of eisenhower s reluctance to concede that anything be amiss in the terror it be doubtful that heroic intervention by dulles could have produce anything but disaster for he and the country s foreign policy in any event the example of acheson s trample by the senate do not encourage dulles to provoke it he elect to get along during this dark chapter in state department history man who have offer foreign-policy idea late prove wrong by event fill the tumbrels send up to capitol hill they old error of judgment be equate in the curious logic of the time with present treasonous intent they successor absorb the lesson make it a point to have few idea this in turn bring a new fashion in senatorial criticism a the democrat take control in the new style the department be berate a intellectually barren and unable to produce the vital idea need to outwit the russian for three or four year in the mid-1950 s this complaint be hear rumble up from the senate floor whenever there be a dull legislative afternoon it become smart to say that the fault be with dulles because he would not countenance think do by anyone but himself an equally tenable thesis be that the dearth of new think be create by the senate s own penchant for crucify anyone whose idea seem unorthodox to the next generation get along with foreigner there be ninety-eight foreign embassy and legation in
