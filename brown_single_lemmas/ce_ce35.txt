new rule no 2 do nt build from the outside in try to build from the inside out do nt insert you component into fix opening they may or may not fit position you component before you close they in for example do nt wall in you kitchen before you hang the wall cabinet and set the appliance it s a lot quick and easy to dimension the kitchen to fit the cabinet and erect the end wall after they be all in place set you bathtub before you close in the end of the bathroom do nt try to wrestle a 400-lb tub afj through a narrow doorway finish you plumbing before you frame it in most economical frame be a thin non-bearing partition on either side of the pipe finish install and connect up you furnace and you water heater before you wall they in there be no good way to waste time than try to install a furnace in a finish afj closet do nt position you stud before you insert you window in conventional construction that way you may pay more to shim the window into place than you pay for the window you can save all that shim time if you set you window in one two three order first the stud on one side then the window then the stud on the other side install you disappear stairs or stairs to the attic and finish you overhead duct before you drywall the ceiling do nt close in you house until everything have be carry in last wall bob schmitt erect be the wall between the house and garage that way he can truck he part right indoors and unload they under the roof no auto maker would dream of put the head on the engine before he fit the piston in the block and trailer maker those most industrialize and therefore most efficient of homebuilders say they save hundreds of dollar by always build from the inside out new rule no 3 rethink everything to get all the big saving the revolution in material handle offer you this revolution be the big build-better-for-less news of all because 1 it make it easy to handle much heavy unit so you can plan to build with much big and heavy prefabricate component like those show in the picture alongside 2 it make material handle the only construction cost that like earthmoving and roadbuilding should be low today than in 1929 3 it change the answer to who should do what and where it lessen the need for costly on-site fabrication and increase the chance for shop fabrication where almost everything can be make good and cheap 4 it change the answer on when to do what at the site for example instead of put in you driveway last a many builder do you can now save money by put they in first instead of close the house in first a most builder do you can now cut you cost by not close it in until you have to see p 121 5 it change the answer on builder-dealer relation not so long ago many builder be find they could cut they cost by buy direct and short-cutting the dealer but now many of these same builder be find they can cut they cost more by team up with a dealer who have volume enough to afford the most efficient specialize equipment to deliver everything just where it be need drywall inside the house side along the side truss on the wall roof on the roof etc say clarence thompson we dealer must earn we mark-up by perform a service for the builder cheap than he could do it himself the revolution now under way in material handle make this much easy the revolution be well under way but much more remain to be do five year ago a house & home round table cosponsored by the lumber dealer research council report unhappily only one lumber dealer in ten be equip to handle unit load only one box car in eight have the wide door need for unit load only one producer in a hundred be equip to package and ship unit load only one builder in a thousand be equip to receive unit load so from raw material to finish erection the cost of material handle most of it inefficient add up to one-fourth of the total construction cost of house that house & home round table be the real start point for today s revolution in material handle say clarence thompson long chairman of the lumber dealer research council it make we whole industry recognize the need for a new kind of teamwork between manufacturer carrier equipment maker dealer and builder all work together to cut the cost of material handle before that we lumber dealer be work almost single-handed on the problem here be where thing stand today 1 almost all of the 3000 lumber dealer who cater primarily to the new-house market and supply 90 % of this year s new house be mechanize there be few area leave where a builder can not find a dealer equip to save he money by deliver everything at low cost just where he workman will need it 2 practically all bulky house product can now be order in standard unit palletized or unitized for mechanical handle include lumber asphalt shingles glass block face brick plaster lime hardboard gypsum wallboard and sheathing cement insulation sheathing floor tile acoustical tile plaster base and asbestos shingles 3 truck and materials-handling equipment maker now offer specialize unit to meet almost every homebuilding need for some significant new item see the picture 4 more than 50 % of all lumber be unitized an nlrda survey find that at least 492 lumber mill will strap they shipment for mechanize handle of these 376 say they make no extra charge for strap in standard unit because they save enough on mechanize carloading to offset they strap cost most of the other will swallow they $ 50 to $ 3 charge rather than lose a good customer with a 15500-lb fork-lift dealer can unload unitized lumber from wide-door box car for $ 30 compare with $ 165 or more to unload loose lumber one piece at a time say jame wright of afj 5 lumber dealer and lumber manufacturer have agree on a standard unit for unitized shipment 48 wide by a nominal 30 high or six mccracken packet 24 wide by nominal 7 high these unit make it easy to load a much a 48000 bd say 120000 lb in a 50 box car much more than the average for loose-loaded car 6 the railroad have respond by add 20000 more box car with door 12 or wide for forklift unload a 21 % increase while the total number of box car be fall 6 % and by cut they freight rate twice on lumber ship in heavily load car first be a 1958 cut of more than 50 % on that portion of the load in excess of 40000 lb late come a 1961 cut on the west coast still pending elsewhere of $ 07 on 70000 lb-plus carload which work out to more than $ 4 on that portion of the load in excess of 70000 lb 7 more unitized lumber be be ship on flat car and nlrda study show that flat car load with the new type 6-b floating-load method can be unload for a little a $ 054 for long haul these shipment should be protect with water-proof paper this cost from $ 75 to $ 230 but the cover can pay off if the lumber be to be store in the open these carrier cut handle cost for the dealer and the builder say nrlda s jame wright since 1958 carrier that move material from the yard to the job site have undergo more radical change than any of the dealer s other equipment the reason today s component and lumber package be far too bulky to be handle by a truckdriver and a helper so manufacturer have pioneer a new type of vehicle the self-unloading carrier it cut the lumber dealer s cost because it take only one man the driver to unload it and because it unload in a fraction of the time and at a fraction of the cost of hand unload and it help the builder because it can handle a more efficiently package load can deliver it to the good spot in some case right on the roof or inside the house and never take any of the builder s high-priced labor to help unload it say wright we survey show that one third of the retail dealer plan to increase the mechanization of they material handle in the come two year and most of the gain will be in self-unloading vehicle new rule no 4 restudy what you man do to help they waste less of the time you pay for half the manhour you pay for on most job be waste because the job be not plan right so the right tool be not handy at the right place at the right time or the right material be not deliver to the handiest spot or material be not stack in the right order for erection or you buy cheap material that take too long to fit or you workman have to come back twice to finish a job they could have do on one trip even america s most efficient builder bob schmitt of berea hope to cut he labor cost another $ 2000 per house a a result of the time-&-motion study now be complete on he operation by industrial efficiency engineer from the stanley work already this study have suggest way to cut he foundation manhour from 170 to 105 by eliminate idle time and waste motion builder eddie carr of washington past president of nahb cut he bricklaying cost $ 150 a house by adopt the scr masonry process work out after careful time-&-motion study by the structural clay product research foundation to help bricklayer do good work for less a midwestern builder cut he labor cost per thousand brick from $ 81 to $ 4350 by adopt this same process cut they another $ 750 to $ 36 by buy he brick in convenient easy-to-spot 100-brick package the scr process with it precision corner-posts it precision guide line it work level scaffold and it hand-level brick supply take eight manhour to get set but once ready it make it easy for bricklayer to lie a thousand brick a day see page 156 one good way to cut you labor waste be to make sure you be use just the right number of man in each crew report jim lendrum by study man on the job we find that two man a carpenter and a helper can lie a floor fast than three we find that three man two carpenter and a helper can put up wall panel or truss more economically than four man because four man do nt make two team they make one inefficient three-men-and-a-helper team we find that wherever you can use two team on a job five man not four be the magic number no house be ever build that could not have be build good for less if the work have be good plan and the work good schedule new rule no 5 do nt waste any $ 10-a-minute time on green lumber to save $ 03 a stud this be the most penny-wise pound-foolish chisel a builder can commit green lumber be all very well back in the day of wet plaster when the frame lumber be bind to swell and then shrink a ton of water dry out the gypsum but now that all production builder build with drywall and all smart builder build with panel green lumber be an anachronism you can not afford green stud cost about $ 65 dry stud cost less than $ 03 more so if a green stud make a carpenter or a drywall finisher or anybody else waste even 20 second the green stud become more expensive than a dry stud
