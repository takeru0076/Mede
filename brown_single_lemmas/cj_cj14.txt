interestingly enough the effect of the digitalis glycoside be inhibit by a high concentration of potassium in the incubation medium and be enhance by the absence of potassium wolff 1960 b organification of iodine the precise mechanism for organification of iodine in the thyroid be not a yet completely understand however the formation of organically bind iodine mainly mono-iodotyrosine can be accomplish in cell-free system in the absence of addition to the homogenate the product form be an iodinated particulate protein fawcett and kirkwood 1953 taurog potter and chaikoff 1955 taurog potter tong and chaikoff 1956 serif and kirkwood 1958 de groot and carvalho 1960 this iodoprotein do not appear to be the same a what be normally present in the thyroid and there be no evidence so far that thyroglobulin can be iodinated in vitro by cell-free system in addition the iodoamino acid form in large quantity in the intact thyroid be di-iodotyrosine if tyrosine and a system generate hydrogen peroxide be add to a cell-free homogenate of the thyroid large quantity of free mono-iodotyrosine can be form alexander 1959 it be not clear whether this system bear any resemblance to the in vivo iodinating mechanism and a system generate peroxide have not be identify in thyroid tissue on chemical ground it seem most likely that iodide be first convert to afj and then to afj a the active iodinating species in the thyroid gland it appear that protein chiefly thyroglobulin be iodinated and that free tyrosine and thyronine be not iodinated iodination of tyrosine however be not enough for the synthesis of hormone the mono - and di-iodotyrosine must be couple to form tri-iodothyronine and thyroxine the mechanism of this couple have be study in some detail with non-enzymatic system in vitro and can be simulate by certain di-iodotyrosine analogue pitt-rivers and jame 1958 there be so far no evidence to indicate conclusively that this couple be under enzymatic control the chemical nature of the iodocompounds be discuss below p 76 et seq c thyroglobulin synthesis little be know of the synthetic mechanism for formation of thyroglobulin it synthesis have not be demonstrate in cell-free system nor have it synthesis by system with intact thyroid cell in vitro be unequivocally prove there be some reason to think that thyroglobulin synthesis may proceed independently of iodination for in certain transplantable tumour of the rat thyroid contain essentially no iodinated thyroglobulin a protein that appear to be thyroglobulin have be observe in ultracentrifuge experiment wolff robbins and rall 1959 similar finding have be note in a patient with congenital absence of the organification enzyme whose thyroid tissue could only concentrate iodide in addition depend on availability of dietary iodine thyroglobulin may contain vary quantity of iodine d secretion since the circulate thyroid hormone be the amino acid thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine cf section c it be clear that some mechanism must exist in the thyroid gland for they release from protein before secretion the presence of several protease and peptidases have be demonstrate in the thyroid one of the protease have ph optimum of about 37 and another of about 57 mcquillan stanley and trikojus 1954 alpers robbins and rall 1955 the find that the concentration of one of these protease be increase in thyroid gland from tsh-treated animal suggest that this protease may be active in vivo there be no conclusive evidence yet that either of the protease have be prepare in highly purify form nor be they specificity know a study of they activity on thyroglobulin have show that thyroxine be not preferentially release and that the degradation proceed stepwise with the formation of macromolecular intermediate alpers petermann and rall 1956 besides proteolytic enzyme the thyroid possess de-iodinating enzyme a microsomal de-iodinase with a ph optimum of around 8 and require reduce triphosphopyridine nucleotide for activity have be identify in the thyroid stanbury 1957 this de-iodinating enzyme be effective against mono - and di-iodotyrosine but do not de-iodinate thyroxine or tri-iodothyronine it be assume that the iodine release from the iodotyrosines remain in the iodide pool of the thyroid where it be oxidise and re-incorporate into thyroglobulin the thyroxine and tri-iodothyronine release by proteolysis and so escape de-iodination presumably diffuse into the blood stream it have be show that thyroglobulin bind thyroxine but the bind do not appear to be particularly strong it have be suggest that the plasma thyroxine-binding protein which have an extremely high affinity for thyroxine compete with thyroglobulin for thyroxine ingbar and freinkel 1957 e antithyroid drug antithyroid drug be of two general type one type have a small univalent anion of the thiocyanate-perchlorate-fluoro type this ion inhibit thyroid hormone synthesis by interfere with iodide concentration in the thyroid it do not appear to affect the iodinating mechanism a such the other group of antithyroid agent or drug be typify by thiouracil these drug have no effect on the iodide concentrate mechanism but they inhibit organification the mechanism of action of these drug have not be completely work out but certain of they appear to act by reduce the oxidise form of iodine before it can iodinate thyroglobulin astwood 1954 on the other hand there be a few antithyroid drug of this same general type such a resorcinol possess no reduce activity and possibly act through formation of a complex with molecular iodine any of the antithyroid drug of either type if give in large enough dose for a long period of time will cause goitre owe to inhibition of thyroid hormone synthesis with production of hypothyroidism the anterior lobe of the pituitary then respond by an increase output of tsh cause the thyroid to enlarge the effect of drug that act on the iodide-concentrating mechanism can be counteract by addition of relatively large amount of iodine to the diet the antithyroid drug of the thiouracil type however be not antagonise by such mean besides those of the thiouracil and resorcinol type certain antithyroid drug have be find in naturally occur food the most conclusively identify be l-5-vinyl-2-thio-oxazolidone which be isolate from rutabaga greer 1950 it be presume to occur in other member of the brassica family there be some evidence that naturally occur goitrogens may play a role in the development of goitre particularly in tasmania and australia clements and wishart 1956 there it seem that the goitrogen ingest by dairy animal be itself inactive but be convert in the animal to an active goitrogen which be then secrete in the milk f dietary influence besides the presence of goitrogens in the diet the level of iodine itself in the diet play a major role in govern the activity of the thyroid gland in the experimental animal and in man gross deficiency in dietary iodine cause thyroid hyperplasia hypertrophy and increase thyroid activity money rall and rawson 1952 stanbury brownell rigg perinetti itoiz and del castillo 1954 in man the normal level of iodine in the diet and the level necessary to prevent development of goitre be about 100 \*\* ymg per day with low level thyroid hypertrophy and increase thyroid blood-flow enable the thyroid to accumulate a large proportion of the daily intake of iodine far the gland be able to re-use a large fraction of the thyroid hormone de-iodinated peripherally in the presence of a low iodine intake thyroglobulin label in vivo with afj be find to contain more mono-iodotyrosine than normal the amount of di-iodotyrosine and iodothyronines be correspondingly reduce this appear to result from both a reduce amount of the iodine substrate and a more rapid secretion of newly iodinated thyroglobulin if the deficiency persist long enough it be reasonable to suppose that the afj label will reflect the afj distribution in the thyroglobulin similar result might be expect from the influence of drug or pathological condition that limit iodide trap or organification or accelerate thyroglobulin proteolysis b the thyroid-stimulating hormone the name thyroid-stimulating hormone tsh have be give to a substance find in the anterior pituitary gland of all species of animal so test for it presence the hormone have also be call thyrotrophin or thyrotrophic hormone at the present time we do not know by what biochemical mechanism tsh act on the thyroid but for bio-assay of the hormone there be a number of property by which it activity may be estimate include release of iodine from the thyroid increase in thyroid weight increase in mean height of the follicular cell and increase in the thyroidal uptake of afj here we shall restrict discussion to those method that appear sufficiently sensitive and precise for determine the concentration of tsh in blood brown 1959 have review generally the various method of assay tsh and the reader be refer to she paper for far information on the subject 1 chemical constitution and physical property of pituitary tsh a long ago a 1851 it be point out by niepce 1851 that there be a connection between the pituitary and the thyroid this connection be clarify by smith and smith 1922 who show that saline extract of fresh bovine pituitary gland could re-activate the atrophy thyroids of hypophysectomised tadpole the first attempt to isolate tsh come a decade late when janssen and loeser 1931 use trichloroacetic acid to separate the soluble tsh from insoluble impurity after they work other investigator apply salt-fractionation technique to the problem a well a fractionation with organic solvent such a acetone albert 1949 have conclude that the most active preparation of tsh make during this period from 1931 to 1945 be probably about 100 to 300 time a potent a the start material much of this work have be review by white 1944 and by albert 1949 development up to about 1957 have be discuss by sonenberg 1958 in the last few year the application of chromatographic and other modern technique to the problem of isolate tsh have lead to far purification bate and condliffe 1960 pierce carsten and wynston 1960 the most active preparation obtain by these two group of investigator appear to be similar in potency composition and physical property two problem present themselves in consider any hormone in blood first be the circulate form of the hormone the same a that find in the gland where it be synthesise and store second what be it concentration in normal circumstance and in what circumstance will this concentration depart from the normal level and in which direction it be therefore necessary to consider the property of pituitary tsh if the fragmentary chemical information about blood tsh be to be discuss rationally the importance of know in what chemical form the hormone may exist be accentuate by the recent observation that there exist an abnormally long-acting tsh in blood draw from many thyrotoxic patient adam 1958 whether this abnormal tsh differ chemically from pituitary tsh or be alternatively normal tsh with it period of effectiveness modify by some other blood constituent can not be decide without chemical study of the activity in the blood of these patient and a comparison of the substance responsible for the blood activity with pituitary afj in evaluate data on the concentration of tsh in blood one must examine critically the bio-assay method use to obtain they the introduction of the unite state pharmacopoeia reference standard in 1952 and the redefinition and equate of the usp and international unit of thyroid-stimulating activity have make it possible to compare result publish by different investigator since that time we should like to re-emphasise the importance of state result solely in term of international unit of tsh activity and of avoid the re-introduction of biological unit for the most part this discussion will be confine to result obtain since the introduction of the reference standard a standard preparation and unit of thyroid-stimulating activity the international unit u adopt to make possible the comparison of result from different laboratory mussett and perry 1955 have be define a the amount of activity present in 135 mg of the international standard preparation the international unit be equipotent with the usp unit adopt in 1952 which be define a the amount of activity present in 20 mg of the usp reference substance
