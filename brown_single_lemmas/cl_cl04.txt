he jowl be spike by barb of gray beard he small mean eye regard marty steadily unblinkingly he eye be thread by little filament of red a if tiny vein have burst and flood blood into they a he chew he gum and exude wheeze breath marty smell the reek of bad whiskey marty recognize the man he have drive the car that pass they on the road outside admassy s place this be acey squire proprietor of the juke joint marty smile at squire pleasantly and say there be a cab wait for i here do you know where it might have go squire chew he gum he jaw move in a steady rhythm he look straight at marty he do not answer marty scan the face of the other near he look into they stare eye do anyone see i cab he ask keep he voice casual he avoid show any surprise or annoyance when no one answer he i have to get back to jarrodsville he go on i see there be some car here i wonder if one of you gentleman could drive i back to town i d be happy to pay for the favor of course the seventeen man stand and stare at he for a moment long and then a startle thing occur it be so utterly unexpect that marty stand for several moment with he mouth hang open foolishly after it have happen there be no word speak no apparent signal give yet the man all move at the same instant they pile into the wait car motor roar the car speed off the station wagon and the old plymouth head east toward jarrodsville the ford and the pickup truck speed west toward sanford s run in second all four car be out of sight marty land stand alone on a red-clay road a storm cloud gather ominously in the sky again from a great distance thunder growl and break the silence land look back toward the dilapidated house he think he see a pale face at a window perhaps it be dora may perhaps she would be glad that they have nt hurt he there be other farmhouse nearby across the road there be one no more than a hundred yard away there be another on this side a little far down there be many more between here and jarrodsville telephone pole line the road they rear tall and mock they wire stretch out into infinity not a single strand of wire reach into the silent house beside the red-clay road there be nothing he could do but walk and jarrodsville be more than three mile away down an old dirt road that the rain have turn into a quagmire marty face east and start walk down the leave side of the road after he have proceed a few foot he pause and turn up the cuff of he trousers which be already damp and mud-caked the viscous mud be ankle-deep and in place great puddle spread across the road and reflect the murky light a he approach the first farmhouse thunder sound behind he again close now and loud like a steadily advance drum corps there be several people on the porch of the farmhouse there be a very old man and a young woman and a brood of child range from toddler to teen-agers for just an instant he think of appeal to they for help perhaps they have a car or truck and would drive he into town then he realize the utter futility of the idea they be stare at he in the same blank and menace way that the man outside the gate have stare even the eye of the small child seem malicious on he side of the road there be two farm hand well back in a field lean against a plow they too stare at he the drum of thunder be right behind he now a foolish think come into he head he remember a story he have read a a youth it be probably one of kipling s tale of the british army it concern an officer who have be disgrace and drum out the steady roll of the drum have sound behind he a he walk between the endless rank of the man he have command and each man about-faced and turn he back a the officer approach marty wish these poor farm people would turn they back the fence by the roadside end now the dirt highway be border on either side by a fairly deep drainage ditch too broad to leap over unless you be an olympic star the day s rain have be add to the stagnant water he be trap on the road when he hear the sound of an approach car it be come toward he the car be now in sight marty s heart skip a beat when he recognize it it be the station wagon that have pass he cab on the road the station wagon that have be park at the burch farm acey squire s station wagon it have head back toward jarrodsville that have only be a ruse to lure he out on the desert road now acey and he friend be return to seek he out the station wagon come to a stop a couple of hundred foot in front of he beside a fence field then there be another sound a second car be come from the west from the direction of sanford s run it be the ford that have be outside burch s farm marty look helplessly in both direction it be a narrow road barely wide enough for two car to pass he could not leave the road because of the water-filled drainage ditch when the two car be equidistant from he the station wagon start up again and the ford gather speed they bear down on he there be nothing he could do except jump into the ditch he jump and sink to he knee in muddy water a the two car roar by there be a high-pitched eerie nerve-shattering sound marty know how the union soldier must have feel at chancellorsville and antietam and gettysburg when the rag gray rank charge at they scream the wild banshee howl they call the rebel yell for moment he stand in water shiver and gasp for breath he have turn he ankle slightly and it pain he the car with they load of howl man have disappear in the distance there have be two more car park at the farm a plymouth and a pickup truck they would be come for he next bear down on he from both direction and then the station wagon and the ford would seek he out again he would be harass repeatedly and would escape death by inch time after time all the way to jarrodsville he still have three mile to go back east the more affluent juvenile delinquent who could afford hyped-up auto instead of switch blade a lethal weapon play this same game and call it chicken he could not go through the field that way be bar on both side of the road by a high barbed-wire fence he have to make for the section of road just ahead that be border by the rail fence the section by the farmhouse at least he could climb up on the fence when he tormenters roar by again the admassy place could not be far now he would go in there climb through the window and at least be safe for a little while and able to rest there be even a bare chance that the phone have not be disconnect he do not dare climb back up to the road he be deep in water but at least they could not reach he there he splash on mud suck at he foot with each step until he reach the end of the drainage ditch and the begin of the fence that enclose the farm he climb back to the road and he feel utterly exhaust he stand pant for a moment and then he see something that he have not see before and panic grip he again the fence he only refuge when the metal death come roar at he be make of rail all right but the rail be protect by a thick screen of barbed wire that would rip he flesh if he press against it he lurch on down the road despairingly because there be no place else to go he lose all sense of dignity you could not stand on dignity when you be soak and muddy and you life be at stake probably people be watch he from the porch or from behind the window of this farmhouse too but he do not bother to look he break into a dogtrot breathe heavily stream with sweat he have to reach admassy s place it be he only sanctuary the fence on both side of the road bristle with the barbed wire the fence stretch on endlessly and then he hear they and now he see they the plymouth be come at he from the east the pickup truck from the west they have time it good this time they would reach he at almost exactly the same instant he stop stone-still if he back against the fence one of the car would brush he a it pass and he would be cruelly lacerate by the wire he stumble to the middle of the road and simply stand there wait for they a perfect target the car must have have they gas pedal push down to the floor board they be come on at reckless speed for such old vehicle they thunder at he he hold he arm close to he side and make himself a small a possible when the plymouth near it veer toward he and seem about to run he down he force himself to stay freeze there if he move he would be in the path of the other car he think the fender of the plymouth brush he jacket a it go by in a fraction of a second the pickup truck hurtle by on the other side the weird insane sound of the rebel yell reverberate again and echo from the distant hill he do not leave the middle of the road he do not try to run he trudge on he ache eye focus straight ahead he be near the admassy house he be go to make it he tell himself and then he hear a car come from the east and he feel a if he would break down and weep oh no not again he say aloud not again so soon there be a new sound a sound a pierce a the rebel yell yet different it be the sound of a siren now he see that the approach car be paint white and he begin to wave he arm frantically it be the prowl car from the sheriff s office the car draw up alongside he and stop get in charley este say brusquely he stagger into the back seat and lie back fight for breath there be someone in front with the sheriff it be pete holmes the cabdriver pete turn around and say to marty i guess you think i m a yellow-bellied hound but there be nt no use in i stay there i could nt fight a dozen or so of em if i d stay all that i d have get be four puncture tire and one bust head why do nt you wait at the burch house you must ve know i d go to get the sheriff i be lucky they let i go i guess the sheriff be occupy with maneuvering the car around in a very narrow space when it be finally point east he say you should never have come out here alone this be redneck country every man in every one of these house be a night rider
