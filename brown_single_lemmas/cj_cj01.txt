1 introduction it have recently become practical to use the radio emission of the moon and planet a a new source of information about these body and they atmosphere the result of present observation of the thermal radio emission of the moon be consistent with the very low thermal conductivity of the surface layer which be derive from the variation in the infrared emission during eclipse eg garstung 1958 when sufficiently accurate and complete measurement be available it will be possible to set limit on the thermal and electrical characteristic of the surface and subsurface material of the moon observation of the radio emission of a planet which have an extensive atmosphere will probe the atmosphere to a great extent than those use short wave length and should in some case give otherwise unobtainable information about the characteristic of the solid surface radio observation of venus and jupiter have already supply unexpect experimental data on the physical condition of these planet the observe intensity of the radio emission of venus be much high than the expect thermal intensity although the spectrum indicate by measurement at wave length near 3 cm and 10 cm be like that of a black body at about 600-degrees this result suggest a very high temperature at the solid surface of the planet although there be the possibility that the observe radiation may be a combination of both thermal and non-thermal component and that the observe spectrum be that of a black body merely by coincidence for the case of jupiter the radio emission spectrum be definitely not like the spectrum of a black-body radiator and it seem very likely that the radiation reach the earth be a combination of thermal radiation from the atmosphere and non-thermal component of the remain planet only mar and saturn have be observe a radio source and not very much information be available mar have be observe twice at about 3-cm wave length and the intensity of the observe radiation be in reasonable agreement with the thermal radiation which might be predict on the basis of the know temperature of mar the low intensity of the radiation from saturn have limit observation but again the measure radiation seem to be consistent with a thermal origin no attempt to measure the radio emission of the remain planet have be report and because of they distance small diameter or low temperature the thermal radiation at radio wave length reach the earth from these source be expect to be of very low intensity in spite of this the very large radio reflector and improve amplify technique which be now become available should make it possible to observe the radio emission of most of the planet in a few year the study of the radio emission of the moon and planet begin with the detection of the thermal radiation of the moon at 125-cm wave length by dicke and beringer 1946 this be follow by a comprehensive series of observation of the 125-cm emission of the moon over three lunar cycle by piddington and minnett 1949 they deduce from they measurement that the radio emission from the whole disk of the moon vary during a lunation in a roughly sinusoidal fashion that the amplitude of the variation be considerably less than the amplitude of the variation in the infrared emission a measure by pettit and nicholson 1930 and pettit 1935 and that the maximum of the radio emission come about 3-12 day after full moon which be again in contrast to the infrared emission which reach it maximum at full moon piddington and minnett explain they observation by point out that rocklike material which be likely to make up the surface of the moon would be partially transparent to radio wave although opaque to infrared radiation the infrared emission could then be assume to originate at the surface of the moon while the radio emission originate at some depth beneath the surface where the temperature variation due to solar radiation be reduce in amplitude and shift in phase since the absorption of radio wave in rocklike material vary with wave length it should be possible to sample the temperature variation at different depth beneath the surface and possibly detect change in the structure or composition of the lunar surface material the radio emission of a planet be first detect in 1955 when burke and franklin 1955 identify the origin of interference-like radio noise on they record at about 15 meter wave length a emission from jupiter this sporadic type of planetary radiation be discuss by burke chap 13 and gallet chap 14 steady radiation which be presumably of thermal origin be observe from venus at 315 and 94 cm and from mar and jupiter at 315 cm in 1956 mayer mccullough and sloanaker 1958 a b c and from saturn at 375 cm in 1957 drake and ewen 1958 in the relatively short time since these early observation venus have be observe at additional wave length in the range from 08 to 102 cm and jupiter have be observe over the wave-length range from 303 to 68 afj the observable characteristic of planetary radio radiation be the intensity the polarization and the direction of arrival of the wave the maximum angular diameter of any planetary disk a observe from the earth be about 1 minute of arc this be much small than the high resolution of even the very large reflector now under construction and consequently the radio emission of different region of the disk can not be resolve it should be possible however to put useful limit on the diameter of the radio source by observe with large reflector or with interferometer measurement of polarization be presently limit by apparatus sensitivity and will remain difficult because of the low intensity of the planetary radiation at the earth there have be few measurement specifically for the determination of the polarization of planetary radiation the measurement make with the nrl 50-foot reflector which be altitude-azimuth-mounted would have show a systematic change with local hour angle in the measure intensity of venus and jupiter if a substantial part of the radiation have be linearly polarize recent interferometer measurement radhakrishnan and robert 1960 have show the 960-mc emission of jupiter to be partially polarize and to originate in a region of large diameter than the visible disk other than this very significant result most of the information now available about the radio emission of the planet be restrict to the intensity of the radiation the concept of apparent black-body temperature be use to describe the radiation receive from the moon and the planet the receive radiation be compare with the radiation from a hypothetical black body which subtend the same solid angle a the visible disk of the planet the apparent black-body disk temperature be the temperature which must be assume for the black body in order that the intensity of it radiation should equal that of the observe radiation the use of this concept do not specify the origin of the radiation and only if the planet really radiate a a black body will the apparent black-body temperature correspond to the physical temperature of the emit material the radio radiation of the sun which be reflect from the moon and planet should be negligible compare with they thermal emission at centimeter wave length except possibly at time of exceptional outburst of solar radio noise the quiescent level of centimeter wave-length solar radiation would increase the average disk brightness temperature by less than 1-degree at meter wave length an increase of the order of 10-degrees in the average disk temperature of the near planet would be expect therefore neglect the extreme outburst reflect solar radiation be not expect to cause sizable error in the measurement of planetary radiation in the centimeter - and decimeter-wave-length range 2 the moon 21 observation radio observation of the moon have be make over the range of wave length from 43 mm to 75 cm and the result be summarize in table 1 observation have also be make at 15 mm use optical technique sinton 1955 1956 see also chap 11 not all the observer have use the same procedure or make the same assumption about the lunar brightness distribution when reduce the data and this together with difference in the method of calibrate the antennae and receiver must account for much of the disagreement in the measure radio brightness temperature in the observation at 43 mm coates 1959 the diameter of the antenna beam 67 be small enough to allow resolution of some of the large feature of the lunar surface and contour diagram have be make of the lunar brightness distribution at three lunar phase these observation indicate that the lunar maria heat up more rapidly and also cool off more rapidly than do the mountainous region mare imbrium seem to be an exception and remain cool than the region which surround it these contour diagram also suggest a rather rapid falloff in the radio brightness with latitude very recently observation have be make at 8-mm wave length with a reflector 22 meter in diameter with a resultant beam width of only about 2 amenitskii noskova and salomonovich 1960 the constant-temperature contour be much smooth than those observe at 43 mm by coates 1959 and apparently the emission at 8 mm be not nearly so sensitive to difference in surface feature such high-resolution observation a these be need at several wave length in order that the radio emission of the moon can be properly interpret the observation of mayer mccullough and sloanaker at 315 cm and of sloanaker at 103 cm have not previously be publish and will be briefly describe measurement at 315 cm be obtain on 11 day spread over the interval may 3 to june 19 1956 use the 50-foot reflector at the we naval research laboratory in washington the half-intensity diameter of the antenna beam be about 9 and the angle subtend by the moon include the entire main beam and part of the first side lobe the antenna pattern and the power gain at the peak of the beam be both measure mayer mccullough and sloanaker 1958 so that the absolute power sensitivity of the antenna beam over the solid angle of the moon be know the ratio of the measure antenna temperature change during a drift scan across the moon to the average brightness temperature of the moon over the antenna beam assume that the brightness temperature of the sky be negligible be find by graphical integration of the antenna directivity diagram to be 085 the measure brightness temperature be a good approximation to the brightness temperature at the center of the lunar disk because of the narrow antenna beam and because the temperature distribution over the central portion of the moon s disk be nearly uniform the result of the observation be afj where the phase angle q be measure in degree from new moon and the probable error include absolute a well a relative error this result be plot along with the 86-mm observation of gibson 1958 in figure 1 a the variation in the 3-cm emission of the moon during a lunation be very much less than the variation in the 86-mm emission a would be expect from the explanation of piddington and minnett 1949 in the discussion which follow the time average of the radio emission will be refer to a the constant component and the superimpose periodic variation will be call the variable component the 103-cm observation of sloanaker be make on may 20 1958 use the 84-foot reflector at the maryland point observatory of the we naval research laboratory the age of the moon be about 2 day the half-intensity diameter of the main lobe of the antenna be about 185 and the brightness temperature be reduce by assume a gaussian shape for the antenna beam and a uniformly bright disk for the moon
