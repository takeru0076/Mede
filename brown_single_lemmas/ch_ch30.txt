between meeting he help the president keep track of delegate matter since these duty fit neatly with those of the propose presidential aide one person with adequate staff assistance could fill both job since faculty see themselves a self-employed professional rather than a employee enthusiasm in a common enterprise be proportionate to the sense of ownership they have in it by virtue of share in the decision that govern it course the faculty believe that broad autonomy be necessary to preserve it freedom in teach and scholarship the president expect faculty member to remember in exercise they autonomy that they share no collective responsibility for the university s income nor be they personally accountable for top-level decision he may welcome they appropriate participation in the determination of high policy but he have a right to expect in return that they will leave administrative matter to the administration how well do faculty member govern themselves there be little evidence that they be give any systematic think to a general theory of the optimum scope and nature of they part in government they sometimes pay more attention to they right than to they own internal problem of government they too need to learn to delegate let the administration take detail off they hand would give they more time to inform themselves about education a a whole an area that would benefit by more faculty attention although faculty insist on govern themselves they grant little prestige to a member who actively participate in college or university government there be nevertheless several thing that the president can do to stimulate participation and to enhance the prestige of those who be will to exercise they privilege he can for example present significant university-wide issue to the senate he can encourage quality in faculty committee work in various way by see to it that the membership of each committee represent the thoughtful a well a the action-oriented faculty by make certain that no faculty member have too many committee assignment by assure good liaison between the committee and the administration by minimize the number of committee despite the many avenue for the exchange of idea between faculty and administration complaint of a lack of communication persist the cause be a often neglect a hesitance to disclose a busy president conversant with a problem and it ramification and beset by pressure to meet deadline tend naturally to assume that other must be a familiar with a problem a he be the need for interchange and understand make vital the full use of all method of consultation to increase faculty influence and decrease tension many president have establish a stand advisory committee with which they can discuss problem frankly the president have little influence in day-by-day curricular change but if he look ahead two three or five year to anticipate issue and throw out challenge idea he can open the way for innovation and he can also have a great deal to say a to what path it will take success will require tact sensitivity to faculty prerogative patience and persistence the critical task for every president and he academic administrative staff be to assure that the college or university continually rebuild and regenerate itself so that it performance will match change social demand great professor do not automatically reproduce themselves dean can form an important bridge between the president and the faculty they serve not only a spokesman for they area but they also contribute to top-level decision make the president who appoint strong man who have an all-college or university point of view and a talent and respect for administration can count on useful assistance faculty member depend on they department chairman to promote they interest with the administration the administration at the same time look to the chairman for strategic aid in build strong department one way that this can be do other than by hire new high-priced professor be by constantly encourage the department member to raise they standard of performance the quality of a president s leadership be measure first by he success in build up the faculty by support the effort of the many faculty member who be work to attain ever high standard the president can encourage faculty leadership indirectly he can good help they by insure that rigorous criterion for appointment and promotion be clearly set forth and adhere to the academic dean should take a direct long-term interest in faculty development an alert dean will confer all through the year on personnel need plan for the future qualification of those on the job and bright prospect elsewhere for the maintenance of a long-term program the department and particularly they chairman be strategic they evaluate and nominate candidate for appointment and promotion to provide an independent judgment for the president the academic dean also investigate candidate thoroughly at some college and university a faculty committee review and report to the administration on the qualification of candidate some faculty member and many administrator oppose faculty review group because they either repeat department s action or act pro forma they can be effective however if they member set high standard for candidate and devote substantial time to the work at one university the president cite the faculty review committee a a value partner of the administration in guard and promote the quality of the faculty before the president recommend a candidate to the trustee the administration collect the view of colleague in the same field of knowledge on campus and elsewhere the president or dean read some of he publication to form the true possible evaluation of the quality of he mind no good way to evaluate teach ability have yet be discover although some institution use inventory sheet for a list of criterion to avoid pass over quiet unaggressive teacher a well a to decide whether other merit promotion review of the right of faculty member to promotion or salary increase should be make periodically whether or not they have be recommend for advancement by they department there be certain aspect of personnel development in which a president must involve himself directly he should personally consider the potential of a faculty member propose for tenure to guard against the mistake of make this profoundly serious commitment turn solely upon the man s former achievement no one can be a effective a the president in inspire old man to welcome imaginative new teacher whose philosophy or approach to they specialty be quite different in particular the president may have to summon all he oratorical power to persuade department member to accept an outstanding man above the normal salary scale on those rare occasion when a faculty member on tenure be not meet the standard of the institution the president must also bear the ultimate burden of decision and action a true university like most successful marriage be a unity of diversity without force all component into a single pattern the preparation of a master plan be an opportunity to consider interrelation of knowledge at it high level which a university in contrast to a multiversity should stand for recently college and university have begin to translate they educational philosophy into institution-wide goal each year a few more institution be decide such question a shall we require a liberal education build around a humanities core for all undergraduate or shall we permit early specialization in scientific and technological subject in the first instance adequate appropriate read material and library accommodation must be plan in the second more shop laboratory and staff will be require for the president a master plan look ahead five year the maximum reach for sound forecast offer several practical advantage trustee faculty and administration can consider the consequence of decision before they be make instead of afterwards physical plant and equipment can be efficiently develop propose new program can be examine for appropriateness to goal and for present and future financial fitness more than one president have find that a long-range plan help he to attract major gift it inspire confidence in he institution s determination to establish goal and to achieve they before decide where it be go however a college or university must know where it be the first step be a comprehensive self study make by faculty by outside consultant or by a combination of the two it should sternly appraise curriculum faculty organization building faculty work load and potential for growth in stature and size implementation of the master plan will inevitably be uneven some department will attack they new goal enthusiastically other may drag they foot fund may be readily donate for some purpose but not other a plan must therefore be bring up to date periodically possibly with the assistance of a permanent plan officer to provide the continuous flow of information basic to administrative decision a number of institution have establish office of institutional research some office have very broad responsibility touch on almost all aspect of a university s instructional program they duty include evaluation of the information collect and preparation of recommendation more often these office be restrict to the gather of empirical data the president s opportunity for influence education reach it high point a he decide which project he will cut back which he will advance by increase allowance or new fund-raise effort no matter how high the hope and dream of educator budget make adjust they to the cold reality of dollar and cent when the budget go to trustee for approval it be the president s budget to which he faith and credit be commit it principal feature should be a product of he most consider judgment he can not of course examine each proposal from scratch he review and shape the work of other to mold a single joint product that will good promote the aim of the institution budgeting must be flexible to allow adaptation to the rapid change in scientific and technological scholarship because scientific instruction and research involve increasingly large sum of money an institution should choose it field of prominence otherwise it will be head for bankruptcy at bad and at good towards starvation of other less dramatic but socially and culturally indispensable branch of learn in the national interest even the affluent university must consider some division of labor among they to replace they present ambition to keep up with the joneses in all branch support activity business management public relation fund-raise offer president one of they good chance to buy freedom for attention to education here the reasonable mastery of the element of administration can do much to free a president for he primary role in the area that do not relate directly to the educational program expert subordinate will serve the college or university good than close presidential attention the president should find strong subordinate and delegate the wide discretion to they high education can not compete with the salary scale of the business world but an educational institution can offer many potent intangible attraction to member of the business community that will offset the difference in income just a the entire faculty should know the president s educational philosophy and objective so should non-academic officer they will good understand the relationship of they activity to the academic program and they will be able to explain they action to faculty in term of mutual goal a president be frequently besiege to serve in non-academic civic and governmental capacity to make speech to lie group and to make numerous ceremonial appearance on and off campus since he can neither accept nor reject they all he must be govern by the time and energy available for he prime professional obligation declinations and substitution be good receive when he explain why he obligation to he institution preclude he acceptance by share the load of important speech with he colleague the president can develop a cadre of able spokesman who will help to create a public perception of the university a an institution something more than the lengthen shadow of one man
