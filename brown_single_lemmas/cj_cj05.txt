polyphosphate give renew life to soap product at a time when surfactant be a threat though expensive and these same polyphosphate spell the decline of soap usage when the synergism between polyphosphate and synthetic detergent active be recognize and exploit the market today for detergent builder be quite diverse the good know field of application for builder be in heavy-duty spray-dried detergent formulation for household use these widely advertise product which be use primarily for wash clothe be base on high-sudsing synthetic organic active sodium alkylbenzenesulfonates and contain up to 50 % by weight of sodium tripolyphosphate or a mixture of sodium tripolyphosphate and tetrasodium pyrophosphate in the household market there be also low-sudsing detergent formulation base on nonionic active with about the same amount of phosphate builder light-duty synthetic detergent with much less builder and the dwindle built-soap powder a well a soap flake and granule none of which be now nationally advertise a well-publicized entrant which have achieve success only recently be the build liquid detergent with which the major problem today be incorporation of builder and active into a small volume use a sufficiently high builder ratio hard-surface clean in household application be represent by two class of alkaline product 1 the formulation make expressly for machine dishwasher and 2 the general-purpose cleaner use for wall and woodwork the good quality product in both of these line contain phosphate builder in addition many of the hard-surface cleaner use for wall and woodwork have they genesis in trisodium orthophosphate which be still the major ingredient of a number of such product many scour powder now also contain phosphate these hard-surface cleaner be discuss in chapter 28 the clean process clean or detergent action be entirely a matter of surface wet clean involve an aqueous medium a solid substrate soil to be remove and the detergent or surface-active material an oversimplify differentiation between soft - and hard-surface clean lie in the magnitude and kind of surface involve one gram of cotton have be find to have a specific surface area of afj in contrast a metal coupon afj in size would have a magnitude from 100000 to a million less even here there be room for some variation for metal surface vary in smoothness absorptive capacity and chemical reactivity spring use a brush surface-analyzer in a metal-cleaning study and show considerable difference in soil removal depend upon surface roughness there be considerable difference between the requirement for textile and hard-surface clean exclusive of esthetic value such a high - or low-foam level perfume content etc the requirement for the organic active use in wash textile be high no matter how they be formulate a large number of organic active be simply not suitable for this application since they do not give adequate soil removal this be good demonstrate by practical wash test in which cloth article be repeatedly wash with the same detergent formulation a good formulation will keep the clothe clean and white after many washing whereas with a poor formulation the clothe exhibit a build-up of tattle-tale grey and dirty spot sometimes with bad result even after the first wash since practical wash procedure be both lengthy and expensive a number of laboratory test have be develop for the numerical evaluation of detergent harris have indicate that two device the launder-ometer and terg-o-tometer be most widely use for rapid detergent test and he have list the commercially available standard soil fabric also give be several laboratory wash procedure in general use the soil fabric use for rapid test of detergent formulation be make in such a way that only part of the soil be remove by even the good detergent formulation in a single wash in this way numerical value for the relative efficacy of various detergent formulation can be obtain by measure the reflectance whiteness of the cloth swatch before and after wash soil redeposition be evaluate by wash clean swatch with the dirty one a be the case with the surface-active agent the requirement for builder to be use in detergent composition for wash textile be also high large number of potential builder have be investigate but none have be find to be a effective a the polyphosphate over the relatively wide range of condition meet in practice the problem of hard-surface clean be not nearly a complex in hard-surface clean the inorganic salt be more important than the organic active indeed when the proper inorganic constituent be employ practically any wet or surface-active agent will do a reasonably good job when present in sufficient amount in a hard-surface clean formulation hydroxide orthophosphate borates carbonate and silicate be important inorganic ingredient of hard-surface cleaner in addition the polyphosphate be also use probably act more a peptizing agent than anything else the importance of the inorganic constituent in hard-surface clean have be emphasize in a number of paper physical chemistry of wash although there be no question but that the process of wash fabric involve a number of phenomenon which be relate together in an extremely complicate way and that these phenomenon and they interrelation be not well understand at the present this section attempt to present briefly an up-to-date picture of the physical chemistry of wash either fabric or hard surface the purpose of wash be obviously to remove soil which be arbitrarily class in the four major category give below 1 dirt which be here define a particulate material which be usually inorganic and be very often extremely finely divide so a to exhibit colloidal property 2 greasy soil which be typify by hydrocarbon and fat ester of glycerol with long-chain organic acid 3 stain which include the wide variety of nonparticulate material which give color even when present in very low concentration on the soil object 4 miscellaneous soil which primarily include sticky substance and colorless liquid which evaporate to leave a residue the dirt on the soil object be mechanically hold by surface irregularity to some extent however a major factor in bind dirt be the attraction between surface that go under the name of van der waal s force this be a theoretically complicate dipole interaction which cause any extremely small uncharged particle to agglomerate with other small uncharged particle or to stick to an uncharged surface obviously if colloidal particle bear charge of opposite sign or if one kind be charge and the other kind be not the attraction will be intensify and the tendency to agglomerate will be greatly reinforce likewise a charge particle will tend to stick to an uncharged surface and vice versa and a charge particle will be very strongly attract to a surface exhibit an opposite charge in addition dirt particle can be hold onto a soil surface by sticky substance or by the surface tension of liquid include liquid grease grease stain and miscellaneous soil be usually sorbed onto the soil surface in most case these soil be take up a liquid through capillary action in an essentially static system an oil can not be replace by water on a surface unless the interfacial tension of the water phase be reduce by a surface-active agent the wash process whereby soil be remove consist basically of apply mechanical action to loosen the dirt particle and dry matter in the presence of water which help to float off the debris and act to some extent a a dissolve and solvating agent greasy soil be hardly remove by wash in plain water and natural water in addition often contain impurity such a calcium salt which can react with soil to make they more difficult to remove therefore detergent be use the detergent active be that substance which primarily act to remove greasy soil the other constituent in a build detergent assist in this and in the removal of dirty stain and the hydrophilic sticky or dry soil a be well know detergent active belong to the chemical class consist of moderately high molecular weight and highly polar molecule which exhibit the property of form micelle in solution physicochemical investigation of anionic surfactant include the soap have show that there be little polymerization or agglomeration of the chain anion below a certain region of concentration call the critical micelle concentration 1 below the critical micelle concentration monomer and some dimer be present 2 in the critical micelle region there be a rapid agglomeration or polymerization to give the micelle which have a degree of polymerization average around 60 - 80 3 for anionic these micelle appear to be roughly spherical assemblage in which the hydrocarbon tail come together so that the polar group the ionize end face outward towards the aqueous continuous phase obviously hydrophobic oleophilic substance such a grease oil or particle have a greasy or oily surface be more at home in the center of a micelle than in the aqueous phase micelle can imbibe and hold a considerable amount of oleophilic substance so that the micelle volume may be increase a much a approximately two-fold although the matter have not be unequivocally demonstrate the available data show that micelle in themselves do not contribute significantly to the detergency process relate to micelle formation be the technologically important ability of detergent active to congregate at oil - water interface in such a manner that the polar or ionize end of the molecule be direct towards the aqueous phase and the hydrocarbon chain towards the oily phase in the clean process sorbed greasy soil become coat in this manner with an orient film of surfactant then during wash the greasy soil roll back at the edge so that emulsify droplet can disengage themselves from the sorbed oil mass with the aid of mechanical action and enter the aqueous phase obviously a substance which be permanently or temporarily sorbed on the surface in place of the soil will tend to accelerate this process and effectively push off the greasy soil substance other than detergent active also tend to be strongly sorbed from aqueous media onto surface of other contiguous condense phase this be particularly true of highly charge ion especially those ion which fall into the class of polyelectrolytes whereas the usual organic surface-active agent be strongly sorbed at oil - water interface the highly charge ion be most strongly sorbed at interface between water and insoluble material exhibit an ionic structure see table 26-2 on p 1678 thus for aqueous media we can think of the idealize organic active a an oleophilic or hydrophobic surface-active agent and of an idealize builder a a oleophobic or hydrophilic surface-active agent from the equilibrium sorption data which be available it seem logical to expect that polyphosphate ion would be strongly sorbed on the surface of the dirt especially clay soil so a to give it a greatly increase negative charge the charge particle then repel each other and be also repel from the charge surface which almost invariably bear a negative charge under wash condition the negatively charge dirt particle then leave the surface and go into the aqueous phase this hypothesis be evolve in analogy to the demonstrate action of organic active in detergency it do not consider the kinetic effect of the phosphate builder on sorption-desorption phenomenon which will be discuss late see p 1746 - 1748 the crude picture of the detergency process thus far develop can be represent a afj the influence of mechanical action on the particle of free soil may be compare to that of kinetic energy on a molecular scale free soil must be disperse and protect against flocculation clean cloth must be protect against the redeposition of disperse soil it be evident that the requirement impose by these effect upon any one detergent constituent act alone be severe upon consideration of the variety of soil and fabric normally encounter in the wash process it be little wonder that the use of a number of detergent constituent have synergistic property have gain widespread acceptance in the over-all process it be difficult to assign a pure role to each constituent of a built-detergent formulation and indeed there be no more reason to separate the interrelate role of the active builder antiredeposition agent etc than there be to assign individual action to each of the numerous isomer make up a give commercial organic active
