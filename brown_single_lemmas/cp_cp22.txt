i know it a surely a everybody in westfield that lucille be a husband stealer you can nt keep that kind of information quiet in a town of only 4000-plus and i ve be tell that just about every town no matter what it size have it lucille warren just a it have it susan dolan though nobody d ever bother to tell i that susan dolan that s i they even talk about lucille down at the young christian league where i spend a lot of time in bible class and help out with the office work for we foreign mission i never hear i folk talk about she though they be good-living religious people and i can truthfully say i never hear they spread any gossip about anybody even if they ever do say anything about people like lucille warren i know they would nt have dream of say it in front of i i folk and i faith protect i from thing like that and so i be really upset the first time i discover that i boy friend johnnie be see mrs warren i ask he about it one night while we be sit in he truck i ask he if it be true he give i a straight honest answer look sue baby he d say much a i love you well a guy s a guy and lucille s will to to come across honest kitten that s all it be i do nt even like lucille much i guess it be at that moment that i realize what i be up against in the person of lucille warren but it do nt seem fair i love for johnnie be young and clean how could i possibly compete with a woman like that who do nt hesitate to use she sex johnnie be a trucker with a small lumber outfit in a town about twenty mile away and he be also pretty good at anything in the carpentry line it be a vivid sharp february morning that johnnie first make he appearance in i back yard bring some stuff dad have order i be nt in the habit of bat i eye at delivery man but the moment i see johnnie i know he be different he be nt only different he be it he have an easy masculine grace about he the kind that kid do nt have but that i have sometimes admire in other old man he smile be quick and he eye hold some promise secret that make i knee go limp the most unbelievable thing about the chance meet be that he seem interest in i too i could hardly believe such good luck be i and now lucille warren have get a look at he i guess she be between affair or something but anyway she have set she sight on johnnie i johnnie i do nt like it one bit but what could i do a man have to have he release at least that s what the boy use to say in high school and i be nt provide it for johnnie neither be he wife she would nt have even if he d ask she but he would nt ask she he be nt the kind of man who would force he wife to submit to he against she will and he would nt leave she either he d tell i that he be too honorable to leave he wife penniless and leave those helpless child without they daddy johnnie love i and want i but the only love i be give he be the pure kind it be week before we even kiss for the first time against i folk wish we d be see each other for short ride in the truck the ride be tame enough mostly we talk but by the time the first crackle of spring come around we both know we be hopelessly in love yet even then we do nothing much but talk and maybe neck a little it s so crazy i tell he once i always imagine i would probably end up marry a minister or somebody like that somebody with no vice you know and you fall for a lumber jockey who drink far too much and smoke too much and i be tick off the item on i finger swear too much and go out with the boy whoever they be too much and who ever go to church and will nt even listen when i try to persuade he to come back to the fold he examine he nail carefully i could walk out the door do nt you dare and never show i face or i truck around here again he still be nt look at i you would nt or i could visit lucille warren you would nt please you would nt he shrug noncommittally i might and now he be see she he d just admit it to i i huddle miserably beside he in the truck it be all i do he see she johnnie and i have be innocent in we love and that be the way i want to keep it at first johnnie have nt understand how could he not be a religious person like i but then he have say all right kid if that s how you want it that s how it ll be but what have i do try to keep we pure i have drive he into the arm of that scheme woman i have just the same a deliver he into the hand of the devil so one week late i surrender to he in the little motel on route 10 i very first time i be desperate to hold he to give he whatever in this world he want or need and to keep he from the clutch of lucille warren and though at the time i blush to admit it even to myself there be in i a grow desire a sexual awareness that johnnie have set in motion an awareness that no other man have ever trigger i want he with a terrify fierceness astonishingly enough it be i own voice i hear there in the darkness beg this man to make love to i love i johnnie i will kitten outside in the summertime field behind the motel a thousand cricket serenade we will you always love i this way uh huh always mmm and i snuggle close to the man i love it be a blissful and fulfil a night a any bride ever experience i have have no wedding ceremony no witness no certificate of marriage but i have all the joy that go with they johnnie it can nt be wrong can it not really johnnie rise on one elbow stop worry it s never wrong if love be real i take great comfort from he word and smile to myself in the darkness infinite peace complete contentment idiot s delight i late discover i feel no conflict between what i be do and i strict religious upbringing i have always resist the pass make at i by other kid and many time i have think about i love for johnnie who be thirty bring a maturity to love that the kid around town could know nothing about i have also think a lot about how god must look on true love and so in a way i be keep i promise to god i promise to remain pure until i be marry i be practically a bride after all there would have be a ceremony if it have be possible of this i have no doubt would nt johnnie do practically anything in the world to insure i happiness of course he would he d not only tell i so he d prove it it be nt johnnie s fault that he be hopelessly tie down to that frightful woman who do she good to make he life unbearable just because he be honorable enough to want to continue support he two child a any decent man would that be no reason he should be deny he own small share of happiness too and if i could contribute to that i d do it the cost do nt matter no price be too high when true love be at stake and i have no doubt about how true this love be i d never even pet with a boy and after i meet johnnie he never touch i for the long while not until i all but throw myself at he he be plenty attentive all right but he behave like a gentleman and i figure that emotionally i be close to he age than to i own eighteen and a half what could a mere twelve year matter it be nt i be sure a difference in age that come between people but a difference in maturity and have nt i rescue he from lucille warren she d have get he if i have nt stop she after all lucille warren be a husband-stealer from way back but i d be a good girl and now god be bless i with the gift of this magnificent man and the wondrous love we share it be only fit that we seek out whatever joy we union might bring love i uh-huh love you always and always johnnie always mmm convention time in boston a chill wind in the air and the narrow street pack with snow from the entire eastern half of the nation they d be come member of the young christian league and i d be choose to represent we chapter i have mix emotion about go i d be see johnnie almost a year now but i still do nt want to leave he for five whole day but i have look forward so much to be with this church group i have nt be do a much work a i use to in westfield and i feel funny about that and want to work
