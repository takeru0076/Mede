during the last year of woodrow wilson s administration a red scare develop in we country many american react irrationally to the challenge of russia and turn to the repression of idea by force postmaster general burleson set about to protect the american people against radical propaganda that might be spread through the mail attorney general palmer make a series of raid that send more than 4000 so-called radical to the jail in direct violation of they constitutional right then not many year late the un-american activity committee under the leadership of martin die pillory hundreds of decent patriotic citizen anyone who try to remedy some of the most glare defect in we form of democracy be denounce a a traitorous red whose real purpose be the destruction of we government this hysteria reach it height under the leadership of senator joseph mccarthy demagogue of this sort find communist bogey lurk behind any new idea that would run counter to stereotyp notion new idea be dangerous and must be repress no matter how those who would suppress dangerous thought credit idea with high potency they give strict interpretation to william jame statement that every idea that enter the mind tend to express itself they seem to believe that a person will act automatically a soon a he contact something new hence the only defensible procedure be to repress any and every notion unless it give evidence that it be perfectly safe despite this danger however we be inform on every hand that idea not machine be we fine tool they be priceless even though they can not be record on a ledger page they be the most valuable of commodity and the most salable for they demand far exceed supply so all-important be idea we be tell that person successful in business and happy in social life usually fall into two class those who invent new idea of they own and those who borrow beg or steal from other seemingly with an unrestricted flow of idea all will be well and we be even assure that an idea a day will keep the sheriff away that however may also bring the police if the think do not meet with social approval criminal a well a model citizen exercise they mind merely have a mental image of some sort be not the all-important consideration of course there must be clarity a single distinct impression be more valuable than many fuzzy one but clarity be not enough the writer take a class of college student to the state hospital for the mentally ill in st joseph missouri an inmate a former university professor expound to we logically and clearly that someone be pilfer he thought he appeal to we to bring he case to the attention of the authority that justice might be do despite the clarity of he presentation he idea be not of einsteinian calibre true idea be important perhaps life s most precious treasure but have we not go overboard in stress they significance have we not actually develop idea worship idea we must have and we seek they everywhere we scour literature for they here we find store the wisdom of great mind but be all these work worthy of consideration can they stand rigid scrutiny shakespeare s wit and wisdom he profound insight into human nature have stand the test of century but be he infallible in all thing what of he treatment of the jew in the merchant of venice shakespeare give we a vivid picture of shylock but probably he never see a jew unless in some of he travel the jew have be banish from england in 1290 and be not permit to return before 1655 when shakespeare have be dead for thirty-nine year if any have escape expulsion by hide they certainly would not frequent the market-place shakespeare do not usually invent the incident in he play but borrow they from old story ballad and play weave they together and then breathe into they he spark of life rather than from a first-hand study of jewish people he delineation of shylock stem from a collection of italian story il pecorone publish in 1558 although write almost two century early he could learn at second hand from book but could not thus capture the real jewish spirit harris j griston in shake the dust from shakespeare 216 write there be not a word speak by shylock which one would expect from a real jew he take the story of the pound of flesh and have to fasten it on someone the jew be the safe victim no jew be on hand to boycott he financially struggle theater it would have be unwise policy for instance to apply the pound-of-flesh characterization to the thrifty scotchman just a now anyone may hurl insult at a citizen of mar or even of tikopia and no senatorial investigation will result who care about they shakespeare do not tell we that shylock be an aberrant individual he set he forth a be typical of the group he tell of he jewish heart not a shylockian heart but a jewish heart this would make anyone crafty and cruel capable of fiendish revenge there be no justification for such misrepresentation if live jew be unavailable for study the bible be at hand read the old testament would have show the dramatist that the idea attribute to shylock be abhorrent to the jew be we good off for have shakespeare s idea of shylock study the merchant of venice in high school and college have give many young people they notion about jew do this help the non-jew to understand this group thoma de torquemada inquisitor-general of the spanish inquisition put many person to death he name become synonymous with cold-blooded cruelty would we gain by keep alive he memory and besmirch today s roman catholic by say he have a catholic heart let he bone and he memory rest in the fifteenth century where they belong he be out of place in we time shakespeare s shylock too be of dubious value in the modern world idea in and of themselves be not necessarily the great good a successful businessman recently preface he address to a luncheon group with the statement that all economist should be send to the hospital for the mentally derange where they and they theory might rot together will he word come to be treasure and quote through the year frequently we be give assurance that automatically all idea will be sift and resifted and in the end only the good one will survive but be that not like go to a chemistry laboratory and blindly pour out liquid and powder from an array of bottle and then after stir expect a new wonder drug inevitably to result what of the efficiency of this natural instrument of free discussion be there some magic in it that assure result when peter b kyne pride of palomar 43 inform we in 1921 that we have an instinctive dislike for the japanese do the heat debate of the californian settle the truth or falsity of the proposition the leopard s spot come from the pen of thoma dixon in 1902 and in this he announce an unchangeable law if a child have a single drop of negro blood he would revert to the ancestral line which except a slave under a superior race have not make one step of progress in 3000 year that doctrine have be accept by many but have it produce good result in the same vein a certain short-story plot have be overwork the son and heir of a prominent family marry a girl who have tell-tale shadow on the half-moon of she finger nail in time she present she aristocratic husband with a coal-black child be the world good for have this idea thrust upon it will argument and debate decide it truth or falsity for answer to such question we must turn to the anthropologist the biologist the historian the psychologist and the sociologist long ago they consign the notion of kyne and dixon to the scrap heap false idea surfeit another sector of we life for several generation much fiction have appear deal with the steprelationship the stepmother almost without exception have be present a a cruel ogress child condition by this mistake notion have fear stepmother while adult by they antagonistic attitude have make the role of the substitute parent a difficult one debate be not likely to resolve the tension and make the lot of the stepchild a happy one research on the other hand have show many stepmother to be eminently successful some far good than the real mother helen deutsch inform we the psychology of woman vol 2 434 that in all culture the term stepmother automatically evoke deprecatory implication a conclusion accept by many will mere debate on that proposition even though it be free and untrammeled remove the dross and leave a residue of refine gold that be questionable to say the least research into several culture have prove she position to be a mistake one most assuredly idea be invaluable but idea just for the sake of have they be not enough in the 1930 s cure for the depression literally flood washington for a time the president receive hundreds of they every day most of they worthless idea need to be test and not merely by argument and debate when some question arise in the medical field concern cancer for instance we do not turn to free and open discussion a in a political campaign we have recourse to the scientifically-trained specialist in the laboratory the merit of the salk anti-polio vaccine be not establish on the forensic platform or in newspaper editorial but in the laboratory and by test in the field on thousands of child we presidential campaign provide much debate and argument but be the result new barnsful of test knowledge on the basis of which we can with confidence solve we domestic and international problem man we be tell be endow with reason and be capable of distinguish good from bad but what a super-herculean task it be to winnow anything of value from the mud-beplastered argument use so freely particularly since such common use be make of cliche and stereotype in themselves declaration of intellectual bankruptcy we be remind however that freedom of think and discussion the unfetter exchange of idea be basic under we form of government assuredly in we political campaign there be freedom to think to examine any and all issue and to speak without restraint no hold be bar but have the result be heartening may we state with confidence that in such an exhibition a republic will find it great security we must not forget to be sure that free discussion and debate have produce beneficial result in truth we can say that this break the power of senator joseph mccarthy who be finally expose in full light to the american people if he have be liquidate in some way he would have become a martyr a rally point for people who share he idea debate in the political arena can be productive of good but it be a clumsy and wasteful process it can produce negative result but not much that be positive debate rid we of mccarthy but do not give we much that be positive it do something to clear the ground but it erect no strike new structure it do not even provide the architect s plan for anything new in the field of the natural science scientifically verify data be quite readily available and any discussion can be shorten with good result in the field of the social science a considerable fund of test knowledge have be accumulate that can be use to good advantage by no mean would we discourage the production of idea they provide raw material with which to work they provide stimulation that lead to far production we would establish no censorship
