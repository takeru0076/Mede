the thermal exchange of chlorine between afj and liquid afj be readily measurable at temperature in the range of 180-degrees and above the photochemical exchange occur with a quantum yield of the order of unity in the liquid phase at 65-degrees use light absorb only by the afj in the gas phase with afj of afj and afj of afj quantum yield of the order of afj have be observe at 85-degrees despite extensive attempt to obtain highly pure reagent serious difficulty be experience in obtain reproducible rate of reaction it appear possible to set a low limit of about afj for the activation energy of the abstraction of a chlorine atom from a carbon tetrachloride molecule by a chlorine atom to form afj radical the rate of the gas phase exchange reaction appear to be proportional to the first power of the absorb light intensity indicate that the radical intermediate be remove at the wall or by reaction with an impurity rather than by bimolecular radical combination reaction introduction because of the simplicity of the molecule isotopic exchange reaction between elemental halogen and the correspond carbon tetrahalides would appear to offer particularly fruitful possibility for obtain unambiguous basic kinetic data it would appear that it should be possible to determine unique mechanism for the thermal and photochemical reaction in both the liquid and gas phase and to determine value for activation energy of some of the intermediate reaction of atom and free radical a well a information on the heat of dissociation of the carbon-halogen bond the reaction of chlorine with carbon tetrachloride seem particularly suit for such study it should be possible to prepare very pure chlorine by oxidation of inorganic chloride on a vacuum system follow by multiple distillation of the liquid it should be possible to free carbon tetrachloride of any interfere substance by the usual purification method follow by prechlorination prior to addition of radioactive chlorine furthermore the exchange would not be expect to be sensitive to trace amount of impurity because it would not be apt to be a chain reaction since the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine by a chlorine atom would be expect to be too high also it would be expect that afj would compete very effectively with any impurity a a scavenger for afj radical contrary to these expectation we have find it impossible to obtain the degree of reproducibility one would wish even with extensive effort to prepare especially pure reagent we be report these investigation here briefly because of they relevancy to problem of the study of apparently simple exchange reaction of chlorine and because the result furnish some information on the activation energy for abstraction of chlorine atom from carbon tetrachloride experimental reagent matheson high purity tank chlorine be pass through a tube of resublimed afj into an evacuate pyrex system where it be condense with liquid air it be then distil at least three time from a trap at -78-degrees to a liquid air trap with only a small middle fraction be retain in each distillation the purify product be store at -78-degrees in a tube equip with a break seal of several method employ for tag chlorine with radiochlorine the exchange of inactive chlorine with tag aluminum chloride at room temperature be find to be the most satisfactory to prepare the latter silver chloride be precipitate from a solution contain afj obtain from the oak ridge national laboratory the silver chloride be fuse under vacuum in the presence of aluminum chip with the resultant product of afj which be sublime into a flask on the vacuum line previously purify chlorine be subsequently admit and the exchange be allow to take place the radiochlorine be store at -78-degrees in a tube equip with a break seal liter quantity of mallinckrodt low sulfur reagent grade carbon tetrachloride be saturate with afj and afj and illuminate for about 50 hour with a 1000 watt tungsten lamp at a distance of a few inch the mixture be then extract with alkali and with water follow which the carbon tetrachloride be distil on a vigreux column a 25 % center cut be retain which be then degass under vacuum in the presence of afj purify inactive chlorine be then add from one of the tube describe above and the mixture freeze out and seal off in a flask equip with a break seal this chlorine-carbon tetrachloride solution be illuminate for a day follow which the flask be reseal onto a vacuum system and the excess chlorine distil off the require amount of carbon tetrachloride be distil into a series of reaction cell on a manifold on a vacuum line the desire amount of inactive chlorine and radioactive chlorine be likewise condense in these cell on the vacuum line follow which they be freeze down and the manifold a a whole be seal off the content of the manifold for liquid phase experiment be then mix by shake redistribute to the reaction tube freeze down and each tube be then seal off the reactant for the gas phase experiment be first freeze out in a side-arm attach to the manifold and then allow to distil slowly into the manifold of pre-cooled reaction cell before seal off this method in general solve the problem of obtain fairly equal concentration of reactant in each of the six cell from a set reaction condition and analysis the sample for liquid phase thermal reaction study be prepare in pyrex capillary tubing 25 mm id and about 15 cm long in a few experiment the tube be make from standard 6 mm id pyrex tubing of 1 mm wall thickness both type of tube withstand the pressure of approximately 20 atmosphere exert by the carbon tetrachloride at 220-degrees the photochemical reaction cell consist of 10 mm id pyrex tubing 55 cm long diffraction effect be minimize by the fact that the light pass through only liquid-glass interface and not gas-glass interface these cell be use rather than square pyrex tubing because of the tendency of the latter to shatter when thaw freeze carbon tetrachloride the round cell be reproducibly position in the light beam which enter the thermostated mineral oil-bath through a window two type of light source be use a thousand watt projection lamp and an ah6 high pressure mercury arc the light be filter by the soft glass window of the thermostat thus ensure that only light absorb by the chlorine and not by the carbon tetrachloride could enter the reaction cell relative incident light intensity be measure with a thermopile potentiometer system change of intensity on the cell be achieve by use of a wire screen and by vary the distance of the light source from the cell follow reaction the cell be scratch with a file and open under a 20 % aqueous sodium iodide solution carrier afj be add and the aqueous and organic phase be separate cell contain gaseous reactant be immerse in liquid air before open under sodium iodide after titration of the liberate afj with afj aliquot of the aqueous and of the organic phase be count in a solution-type geiger tube in the liquid phase run the amount of carbon tetrachloride in each reaction tube be determine by weigh the tube before open and weigh the fragment after empty the fraction of exchange be determine a the ratio of the count minute observe in the carbon tetrachloride to the count minute calculate for the carbon tetrachloride fraction for equilibrium distribution of the activity between the chlorine and carbon tetrachloride empirically determine correction be make for the difference in count efficiency of afj in afj and afj result the thermal reaction in study the liquid phase thermal reaction some 70 tube from 12 different manifold filling be prepare and analyze experiment be do at 180 200 210 and 220-degrees follow observation of the fact that the reaction rate of supposedly identical reaction mixture prepare on the same fill manifold and expose under identical condition often differ by several hundred per cent a systematic series of experiment be undertake to see whether the difficulty could be ascribe to the method of prepare the chlorine to the effect of oxygen or moisture or to the effect of surface to volume ratio in the reaction tube in addition to the method describe in the section above chlorine and radiochlorine be prepare by the electrolysis of a afj eutectic on the vacuum line and by exchange of afj with molten afj calcium hydride be substitute for afj a a dry agent for carbon tetrachloride no correlation between these variable and the irreproducibility of the result be find the reaction rate observe at 200-degrees range from afj of the chlorine exchange per hour to 07 exchange per hour in most case the chlorine concentration be about afj set of reaction tube contain 02 of an atmosphere of add oxygen in one case and add moisture in another both give reaction rate in the range of 01 to 04 of the chlorine exchange per hour no detectable reaction be find at room temperature for reaction mixture allow to stand up to 5 hour the liquid phase photochemical reaction the liquid phase photochemical exchange between chlorine and carbon tetrachloride be more reproducible than the thermal exchange although still erratic the improvement be most noticeable in the great consistency among reaction cell prepare a a group on the same manifold rather large difference be still find between reaction cell from different manifold filling some 80 reaction tube from 13 manifold filling be illuminate in the temperature range from 40 to 85-degrees in a far endeavor to determine the cause of the irreproducibility and to obtain information on the activation energy and the effect of light intensity in all case there be readily measurable exchange after a little a one hour of illumination by compare reaction cell seal from the same manifold temperature dependency correspond to activation energy range from 11 to 18 afj be observe while dependence on the first power of the light intensity seem to be indicate in most case it be possible to make estimate of the quantum yield by observe the extent of reduction of a uranyl oxalate actinometer solution illuminate for a know time in a typical reaction cell and make appropriate conversion base on the difference in the absorption spectrum of uranyl oxalate and of chlorine and consider the spectral distribution of the light source these estimate indicate that the quantum yield for the exchange of chlorine with liquid carbon tetrachloride at 65-degrees be of the order of magnitude of unity when typical reaction cell to which 03 of an atmosphere of oxygen have be add be illuminate chlorine and phosgene be produce exchange be also observe in these cell which have chlorine present at afj the photochemical exchange in the gas phase although there be some variation in result which must be attribute either to trace impurity or to variation in wall effect the photochemical exchange in the gas phase be sufficiently reproducible so that it seem meaningful to compare the reaction rate in different series of reaction tube for the purpose of obtain information on the effect of chlorine concentration and of carbon tetrachloride concentration on the reaction rate data on such comparison together with data on the effect of light intensity be give in table 1 in series 1 the relative light intensity be vary by vary the distance of the lamp from the reaction cell over the range from 147 to 292 cm the last column show the rate of exchange that would have be observe at a relative intensity of 4 147 cm distance calculate on the assumption that the incident light intensity be inversely proportional to the square of the distance of the lamp from the cell and that the rate be directly proportional to the incident light intensity direct proportionality of the rate to the incident intensity have also be assume in obtain the value in the last column for the fourth sample of series 2 where the light intensity be reduce by use of a screen
