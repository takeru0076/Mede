resume atmospheric test one of the inescapable reality of the cold war be that it have thrust upon the west a wholly new and historically unique set of moral dilemma the first dilemma be the morality of nuclear warfare itself that dilemma be a much with we a ever the second great dilemma have be the morality of nuclear test a dilemma which have suddenly become acute because of the present series of soviet test when this second dilemma first become obvious during the mid to late 50s the unite state appear to have three choice it could have unilaterally abandon far test on the ground of the radiation hazard to future generation it could have continue test to the full on the ground that the radiation danger be far less than the danger of communist world domination or it could have choose to find by negotiation some way of stop the test without loss to national security this third choice be in fact make with the resumption of soviet test and they intransigence at the geneva talk however the hope that this third choice would prove viable have be shake once again the unite state must choose and once again the choice be much the same only this time around the condition be different and the choice be far hard the first choice abandon test entirely would not only be unpopular domestically but would surely be exploit by the russian the second choice full test have become even more risky just because the current soviet test have already dangerously contaminate the atmosphere the third choice negotiation presuppose a russian behavior demonstrate a great deal of wishful think to make it appear reasonable we take the position however that the third choice still remain the only sane one open to we it be by no stretch of the imagination a happy choice and the argument against it a a practical strategy be formidable it primary advantage be that it be a moral choice one which should it fail will not have contaminate the conscience that be the contamination we most fear leave aside the choice of unilateral cessation of test a neither sane nor clearly moral the question must arise a to why resumption of atmospheric test on we part would not be a good choice for that be the one an increasingly large number of prominent american be now propose in particular governor nelson rockefeller have express a cogently and clearly a anyone the case for a resumption of atmospheric test speak recently in miami governor rockefeller say that to assure the sufficiency of we own weapon in the face of the recent soviet test we be now clearly compel to conduct we own nuclear test take account of the fact that such a move on we part would be unpopular in world opinion he argue that the responsibility of the unite state be to do confidently and firmly not what be popular but what be right what be miss in the governor s argument a in so many similar argument be a premise which would enable one to make the ethical leap from what might be militarily desirable to what be right the possibility a he assert that the russian may get ahead of we or come close to we because of they test do not supply the need ethical premise unless of course we have unwittingly become so brutalize that nuclear superiority be now take a a moral demand besides the lack of an adequate ethical dimension to the governor s case one can ask seriously whether we lead over the russian in quality and quantity of nuclear weapon be so slight a to make the test absolutely necessary recent statement by the president and defense department spokesman have to the contrary assure we that we lead be very great unless the administration and the defense department have be deceive we the fact do not support the assertion that we be compel to resume atmospheric test it be perfectly conceivable that a resumption of atmospheric test may at some point in the future be necessary and even justifiable but a resumption do not seem justifiable now what we need to realize be that the increasingly great contamination of the atmosphere by the soviet test have radically increase we own moral obligation we now have to think not only of we national security but also of the future generation who will suffer from any test we might undertake this be an ethical demand which can not be evade or gloss over by talk exclusively of weapon superiority or even of the evil of communism too often in the past russian tactic have be use to justify like tactic on we part there ought to be a point beyond which we will not allow ourselves to go regardless of what russia do the refusal to resume atmospheric test would be a good start ecumenical hope when he holiness pope john 23 first call for an ecumenical council and at the same time voice he yearn for christian unity the enthusiasm among catholic and protestant ecumenicists be immediate with good reason it appear that a new day be upon divide christendom but a the more concrete plan for the work of the council gradually become know there be a rather sharp and abrupt disappointment on all side the council we now know will concern itself directly only with the internal affair of the church a it have turn out however the excessive enthusiasm in the first instance and the loss of hope in the second be both wrong response two thing have happen in recent month to bring the council into perspective each provide a basis for renew hope and joy first of all it be now know that pope john see the renewal and purification of the church a an absolutely necessary step toward christian unity far from be irrelevant to the ecumenical task the pontiff believe that a revivify church be require in order that the whole world may see catholicism in the good possible light equally significant pope john have say that catholic themselves bear some responsibility for christian disunity a major aim of the council will be to remove a far a possible whatever in the church today stand in the way of unity secondly a whole series of address and action by the pope and by other show that concern for christian unity be still very much alive and grow within the church the establishment by the holy father of a permanent secretariat for christian unity in 1960 be the most dramatic mark of this concern the designation of five catholic theologian to attend the world council of church assembly in new delhi a official observer reverse the church s early stand the public appeal by the new vatican secretary of state cardinal cicognani for renew effort toward eastern and western reunion be still another remarkable act nor can one forget pope john s unprecedented meet with the archbishop of canterbury augustin cardinal bea the director of the secretariate for christian unity have express a directly a anyone the new spirit that pervade the church s stance toward the protestant and orthodox church note all the difficulty that stand in the way of reunion he have say that they ought not to discourage anyone for discouragement or the temptation to abandon we effort would show that one place excessive trust in purely human mean without think of the omnipotence of god the irresistible efficacy of prayer the action of christ or the power of the divine spirit can any christian fail to respond to these word the budget deficit the administration s official budget review which estimate a 69 billion dollar deficit for the current fiscal year be nt make anyone happy certainly it be nt make the president happy and he have be do he apologetic good to explain how the budget get into it unbalance condition how he intend to economize wherever he can and how he hope to do good next year we sympathize with mr kennedy but we feel bind to say that he budget review do nt please we either although for very different reason furthermore we find he defense of the unbalance budget more dismay than reassure in the first place a large part of the discrepancy between president eisenhower s estimate of a 15 billion dollar surplus for the same period and the new estimate of an almost seven billion dollar deficit be the result of the outgoing president s farewell gift of a political booby-trap to he successor the eisenhower budget be simultaneously inadequate in it provision and yet extravagant in it projection of revenue to be receive the rest of the deficit be also easily understand four billion dollar of the spend increase be for defense an expenditure necessitate by the penny-wise policy of the eisenhhower administration quite apart from the recent crisis in berlin and elsewhere four hundred million dollar of the increase be for the expand space program a responsibility similarly neglect by mr eisenhower the farm program will cost an additional 15 billion because of unusual weather factor the food for peace program and other new measure anti-recession program aid for the unemployed they child and for depress area account for only 900 million of the 69 billion dollar deficit we complaint be that in many crucial area the kennedy program be not too large but too small most seriously in regard to the conventional arm build-up and in aid and welfare measure and yet mr kennedy persist in try to mollify the intransigent of the right with apology and promise of tighten up and economize we wish the president would remember that fiscal responsibility be the battle-cry of the party that lose the election the party that win use to say something about a new frontier ethics and peace introduction of the dialogue principle prove strikingly effective at the thirty-fourth annual meet of the catholic association for international peace in washington the last weekend in october two of the principal address be deliver by prominent protestant and when the speaker be a catholic one discussant on the dais tend to be of another religious persuasion several effect be immediately evident session devote to ethics and foreign policy trend moral principle and political judgment christian ethics in the cold war and relate subject prove to be much lively under this procedure than if catholic be merely talk to themselves usually question from the floor be direct to the non-catholic speaker or discussion leader in the early session there be plentiful discussion on the natural law which dr william v obrien of georgetown university advance a the basis for widely acceptable ethical judgment on foreign policy that aristotelean-thomistic principle experience a thorough going-over from a number of the participant but in the end the concept come to reassert itself speaker declare that protestant often make use of it if perhaps by some other name a lebanese moslem tell about it existence and application in the islamic tradition a the divine law while a caip member who have be work in close association with delegate of the new un nation tell of it widespread recognition on the african continent the impression be unmistakable that whatever one may choose to call it natural law be a function generality with a certain objective existence another question that arise be the nature of the dialogue itself the stimulus from the confrontation of philosophical system involve certain difference be undeniable it be expect that the comparison of different approach to ethics would produce a good grasp of each other s position and good comprehension of one s own but a realization that each group have much of substance to learn from the other also develop and a strong conviction grow that each have insight and dimension to contribute to ethically acceptable solution of urgent political issue one effect of the spirit give-and-take of these discussion be to focus attention on practical application and the necessity of be arm with the fact knowledge of the destructive force of even the tiny tactical atomic weapon would have a bear on judgment a to the advisability of it use to defend berlin for example the pervasive influence of ideology on we political judgment need to be recognize and take into due account it be necessary to perceive the extent of foreign aid demand by the christian imperative
