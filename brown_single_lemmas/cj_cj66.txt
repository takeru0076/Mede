critically invisible modern revolt like x-ray and radioactivity be perceive only by it effect at more materialistic social level where it be call delinquency disaffiliation by the way be the term use by the critic and poet lawrence lipton who have write several article on this subject the first of which in the nation quote a epigraph we disaffiliate john l lewis like the pillar of hercule like two ruine titan guard the entrance to one of dante s circle stand two great dead juvenile delinquent the hero of the post-war generation the great saxophonist charlie parker and dylan thoma if the word deliberate mean anything both of they certainly deliberately destroy themselves both of they be overcome by the horror of the world in which they find themselves because at last they could no long overcome that world with the weapon of a purely lyrical art both of they be i friend live in san francisco i see they seldom enough to see they with a perspective which be not distort by exasperation or fatigue so a the year pass i see they each time in the light of an accelerate personal conflagration the last time i see bird at jimbo s bob city he be so go so blind to the world that he literally sit down on i before he realize i be there what happen man i say refer to the pretentious jazz concert evil man evil he say and that s all he say for the rest of the night about dawn he get up to blow the rowdy crowd chill into stillness and the fluent melody spiraled through it the last time i see dylan he self-destruction have not just pass the limit of rationality it have assume the terrify inertia of inanimate matter be with he be like be sweep away by a torrent of fall stone now dylan thoma and charlie parker have a great deal more in common than the same disastrous end a artist they be very similar they be both very fluent but this fluent enchanting utterance have compare with important artist of the past relatively little content neither of they get very far beyond a sort of entrance rapture at he own creativity the principal theme of thoma s poetry be the ambivalence of birth and death the pain of blood-stained creation music of course be not so explicit an art but anybody who know charlie parker know that he feel much the same way about he own gift both of they do communicate one central theme against the ruin of the world there be only one defense the creative act this of course be the theme of much art perhaps most poetry it be the theme of horace who certainly otherwise bear little resemblance to parker or thoma the difference be that horace accept he theme with a kind of silken assurance to dylan and bird it be an agony and terror i do not believe that this be due to anything especially frightful about they relationship to they own creativity i believe rather that it be due to the catastrophic world in which that creativity seem to be the sole value horace s column of imperishable verse shine quietly enough in the lucid air of augustan rome art may have be for he the most endure orderly and noble activity of man but the other activity of he life partook of these value they do not actively negate they dylan thoma s verse have to find endurance in a world of burn city and burn jew he be able to find mean in he art a long a it be the answer to air raid and gas oven a the world begin to take on the guise of an immense air raid or gas oven i believe he art become meaningless to he i think all this could apply to parker just a well although because of the nature of music it be not demonstrable at least not conclusively thoma and parker have more in common than theme attitude life pattern in the practice of they art there be an obvious technical resemblance contrary to popular belief they be not great technical innovator they effect be only superficially startle thoma be a regression from the technical originality and ingenuity of writer like pierre reverdy or apollinaire similarly the innovation of bop and of parker particularly have be vastly overrate by people unfamiliar with music especially by that ignoramus the intellectual jitterbug the jazz aficionado the tonal novelty consist in the introduction of a few chord use in classical music for century and there be less rhythmic difference between progressive jazz no matter how progressive and dixieland than there be between two movement of many conventional symphony what parker and he contemporary gillespie davis monk roach tristano be an anomaly etc do be to absorb the musical ornamentation of the old jazz into the basic structure of which it then become an integral part and with which it then develop this be true of the melodic line which could be put together from select passage of almost anybody benny carter johnny hodges it be true of the rhythmic pattern in which the beat shift continuously or at least be continuously spring so that it become ambiguous enough to allow the pattern to be dominate by the long pulsation of the phrase or strophe this be exactly what happen in the transition from baroque to rococo music it be the difference between bach and mozart it be not a farfetched analogy to say that this be what thoma do to poetry the special syntactical effect of a rimbaud or an edith sitwell actually ornament become the main concern the metaphysical conceit which fascinate the reactionary generation still dominant in backwater american college be embroidery thoma s ellipses and ambiguity be end in themselves the immediate theme if it exist be incidental and he main theme the terror of birth be simply reiterate this be one difference between bird and dylan which should be point out again contrary to popular belief there be nothing crazy or frantic about parker either musically or emotionally he sinuous melody be a sort of naive transcendence of all experience emotionally it do not resemble berlioz or wagner it resemble mozart this be true also of a painter like jackson pollock he may have be eccentric in he behavior but he painting be a impassive a persian tile partly this difference be due to the nature of verbal communication the insistent talk-aboutiveness of the general environment obtrude into even the most idyllic poetry it be much more a personal difference thoma certainly want to tell people about the ruin and disorder of the world parker and pollock want to substitute a work of art for the world technique pure and simple rendition be not of major importance but it be interest that parker follow lester young be one of the leader of the so-called saxophone revolution in modern jazz the saxophone be treat a a woodwind and play with conventional embouchure metrically thoma s verse be extremely conventional a be incidentally the verse of that other tragic enrage hart crane i want to make clear what i consider the one technical development in the first wave of significant post-war art ornament be confabulation in the interstices of structure a poem by dylan thoma a saxophone solo by charles parker a painting by jackson pollock these be pure confabulation a end in themselves confabulation have come to determine structure uninhibited lyricism should be distinguish from it exact opposite the sterile extraneous invention of the corn-belt metaphysical or present blight of poetic professor just a hart crane have little influence on anyone except very reactionary writer like allen tate for instance to whom valery be the last word in modern poetry and the felicity of an apollinaire let alone a paul eluard be nonsense so dylan thoma s influence have be slight indeed in fact he only disciple the only person to imitate he style be w graham who seem to have imitate he without much understand and who have since move on to other method thoma s principal influence lie in the communication of an attitude that of the now extinct british romantic school of the new apocalypse henry treece jf hendry and other all of whom be quite conventional poet parker certainly have much more of an influence at one time it be the ambition of every saxophone player in every high school band in america to blow like bird even before he death this influence have begin to ebb in fact the whole generation of the found father of bop gillespie monk davis blakey and the rest be just now at a considerable discount the main line of development today go back to lester young and by-pass they the point be that many of the most impressive development in the art nowadays be aberrant idiosyncratic there be no long any sense of continue development of the sort that can be trace from baudelaire to eluard or for that matter from hawthorne through henry jame to gertrude stein the cubist generation before world war 1 and on a low level the surrealist of the period between the war both assume an accept universe of discourse in which to quote andre breton it be possible to make definite advance exactly a in the science i doubt if anyone hold such idea today continuity exit but like the neo-swing music develop from lester young it be a continuity sustain by popular demand in the plastic art a very similar situation exist surrealist like han arp and max ernst might talk of creation by hazard of compose picture by walk on they with paint sole or by toss bit of paper up in the air but it be obvious that they be self-deluded nothing look anything like an ernst or an arp but another ernst or arp nothing look less like they work than the happening of random occasion many of the post-world war 2 abstract expressionist apostle of the discipline of spontaneity and hazard look alike and do look like accident the aesthetic appeal of pure paint lay on at random may exist but it be a very impoverished appeal once again what have happen be an all-consuming confabulation of the incidental the accident of painting it be curious that at it good the work of this school of painting mark rothko jackson pollock clyfford still robert motherwell willem de-kooning and the rest resemble nothing so much a the passage painting of quite unimpressive painter the mother-of-pearl shimmer in the background of a henry mcfee itself a formula derive from renoir the splash of light and black which fake drapery in the fashionable imitator of hal and sargent often work of this sort be present a calligraphy the pure utterance of the brush stroke seek only absolute painteresque value you have only to compare such painting with the work of say sesshu to realize that someone be use word and brush carelessly at it good the abstract expressionist achieve a simple rococo decorative surface it poverty show up immediately when compare with tiepolo where the rococo rise to painting of extraordinary profundity and power a tiepolo painting however confabulated be a universe of tension in vast depth a pollock be an object of art bijouterie disguise only by it great size in fact once the size be big enough to cover a whole wall it turn into nothing more than extremely expensive wallpaper now there be nothing wrong with complicate wallpaper there be just more to tiepolo the great ashikaga brush painter paint wallpaper too at least portable one screen a process of elimination which leave the artist with nothing but the play of he material themselves can not sustain interest in either artist or public for very long so in the last couple of year abstract expressionism have tend toward romantic suggestion indication of landscape or live figure
