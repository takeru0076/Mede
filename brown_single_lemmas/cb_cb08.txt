good friend i do not know dr wilson sneed well but i be deeply move by he letter of resignation a rector of st luke s church in atlanta it be the cry of not just one heart it speak for many in the clergy i suspect the pulpit be a lonely place who stop to think of that imagine the search and the prayer that lie behind the letter the rector write after almost a decade of service to this majestic church such a church need vigor and vitality in it rector and one man have only so much of these endowment he tell he member a minister should not stay beyond the time that he leadership should benefit he church he write for he become ordinary and so the young minister resign to go and study and pray have never pass a day he tell he parishioner when i do not gain from you far more than i ever give to you he very honest act call up the recent talk i have with another minister a modest methodist who say i feel so deeply bless by god when i can give a message of love and comfort to other man and i would have it no other way and it be unworthy to think of self but oh how i do sometimes need just a moment of rest and peace in myself a man who give himself to god and to the believer of he church take upon himself a life of give he do not expect to get great riches or he would not have choose to answer the call to preach the good one be not motivate to seek vainly nor be they dispose to covet comfort or they would have be lead to field that offer comfort and feed vanity theirs be a sacrificial life by earthly standard yet we who lean upon such a man and draw strength from he and expect interpretation of the infinite through he we who readily accept he sacrifice a we due we of the congregation be the first to tell he what be in we mind instead of listen to what be in he soul we press he to conform to we comfortable conception and not to bruise we satisfaction with he word and god s we do not defeat the good one with this cruelty but we add to they burden while expect they to bestow saintliness upon we in return for ostentatious church attendance and a few buck a week american cash if we break the minister to we bit we be buy back we own sin if he will nt break we add to the stress he bear and a minister of all man be most conscious that he be mere man prone to the stress that earthly humanity be heir to we expect he to be noble and to make we so yet he know and try to tell we how very humble man must be we expect bestowal of god s love through he but how little love we give he the church truly be not a rest home for saint but a hospital for sinner yet every sunday we sinner go to that emergency room to receive first aid and we leave unmindful that the man who minister to we be a human be who suffer too
