this be not for the angel just a matter of run through a logical or deductive chain or decide on some action from some already establish premise no doubt the angel could do that kind of thing a fast a any computer what gabriel be be ask to do now however be to re-examine all he basic assumption make value-judgment on they and give they new and different power in he mind to govern he motive this be not wholly a reason process a computer can not do it all and even in an angel it take time or perhaps especially in an angel whose assumption have mostly be fix millions of year ago be reasonably sure of the reason for the long pause however do not make it seem any less long to jack he have already become use to hesperus snap back answer to question almost before jack could get they ask there be nothing he could do but wait the dice be cast at last gabriel speak we misjudge you he say slowly we have conclude that no race a ephemeral a yours could have have time to develop a sense of justice of course we have before we the example of the great race at the galactic center individually they be nearly a mortal a you the difference do not seem very mark to we where it exist but they have survive for long period a race whereas you be young we shall recommend to they that they shorten you trial period by half for now it be clear that we be in the wrong you may reclaim you property and the penalty on hesperus be lift hesperus you may speak i do not perceive this essential distinction either first-born hesperus say at once i be only practice a concept that jack teach i call a deal nevertheless you be it agent jack what be the nature of this concept it s a kind of agreement in which each party give something to the other jack say we regard it a fair only when each party feel that what he have receive be a valuable or more valuable than what he have give he heart he discover be pound for instance hesperus agree to help i find i property and i agree to take he to earth between individual this process be call bargain when it be do between race or nation it be call make a treaty and the major part of i mission to you nest be to make a treaty between you race and i recover the property be much less important strange gabriel say and apparently impossible though it might be that we would have much to give you you have nothing to give we hesperus and lucifer jack say show that we do another pause but this one be not nearly a long then it be a matter of pleasure of curiosity of a more alive time yes those could be commodity under this concept but you should understand jack that hesperus and lucifer be not long out of the nursery visit the earth would not be an offer of worth to those of we who be old this explain a great deal all the more reason then jack say why we must have a treaty we will gladly entertain you young and give they proper live quarter in return for they help in run we fusion reactor but we must know if this be in accordance with you custom and must have you agreement they will not misuse the power we put in they hand to we hurt but this simply require that they behave in accordance with the dictate of they own nature and respect yours in turn to this we of course agree jack feel a wave of complete elation but in a second it have vanish without a trace what gabriel be ask be that mankind forego all it parochial moral judgment and contract to let the angel serve on earth a it be in heaven regardless of the applicable earth law the angel in turn would exercise similar restraint in respect for the natural preference and nature of the earthmen but they have no faint notion of man s perverse habit of pass and enforce law which be contrary to he own preference and violation of he nature the simple treaty principle that gabriel be ask he to ratify in short be nothing less than total trust nothing less would serve and it might be consider the uncomfortable custom the angel have of think of everything in term of absolute that the proposal of anything less might well amount instead to something like a declaration of war furthermore even the highly train law clerk who be a part of jack s total make-up could not understand how the principle could ever be codify almost the whole experience of mankind point toward suspicion not trust a the safe and sane attitude toward all outsider yet there be some precedent for it the history of disarmament agreement for instance have be unreassuringly dismal but the unite state and the union of soviet socialist republic nevertheless do eventually agree on an atomic bomb test ban and a sort of provisional acceptance of each other s good intention on this limit question out of that agreement though not by any easy road eventually emerge the present world hegemony of the unite nation suspicion between member state still exist but it be of about the same low order of virulence a the twentieth-century rivalry between arizona and california over water supply besides agreement in principle with the petty detail to be thrash out late be commonplace in diplomatic history the trouble with they be that they almost never work and in fact an agreement in principle historically turn out to be a sure sign that neither party really want the quarrel settle suppose that this one be to work there be no question in jack s mind of the good faith on one side at least if mankind could be convince of that it be worth try in fact it have to be try it would be at once the most tentative and most final treaty that earth have ever sign secretary hart have teach jack at least partially to be content with small beginning in all diplomatic matter but there be no small way to handle this one he turn back to the screen the crucial conclusive phrase on he lip but he be too late he have lose he audience for a moment he could make no sense at all of what he see it seem to be only a riot of color light and meaningless activity gradually he realize that the pentagon of angel elder have vanish and that the ritual learn dance of the nursery have be break up the angel in the nursery be zigzag wildly in all direction seemingly at random hesperus what s go on here what s happen you brother have be find they be on they way here where i do nt see they the instrument do nt show they you can nt see they yet jack they ll be in range in a short while jack scan the sky the board and the sky again nothing no there be a tiny pip on the radar and it be get big rapidly if that be the skiff it be make unprecedented speed then the skiff hove into sight just a dot of light at first against the roil blackness and crimson streak of the coal sack through the telescope jack could see that both spacesuit be still attach to it the sail be still unfurl though there be a good many hole in it a langer have predict would be the case by now it be a startle almost numenous sight but even more awesome be the fact that it be trail an enormous comets-tail of angel the skiff be not head for the nursery however it seem unlikely that she crew if either of they be alive could even see the ariadne for they be pass she at a distance of nearly a light-year and there would be no chance of signale they without the nernst generator jack could not send a call powerful enough to get through all the static and by the time he could rebuild he fusion power the skiff would be go fume helpless he watch they pass he the sail rag though it be still have enough surface to catch some of the ocean of power be pour out from the nursery star he would never have believe without see it that the bizarre little vessel could go so fast but where be it go and why be it cause so much agitation among the angel and be follow by so many of they there be only one possible answer but jack s horrify mind refuse to believe it until he have feed the radar plot of the skiff s course into the computer the curve on the card the computer spit back at he could nt be argue with however the skiff be head for the very center of the nebula toward that place which jack know now could hold nothing less important than the very core of the angel s life and religion it be clear that langer have at last find a way to attract the angel s attention it be equally clear that a of this moment the treaty be off stern chase 10 langer would have to be head off whether he know where he be go or not almost surely he do after all he have have the same set of fact a jack have have to work from and he be an almost frighteningly observant man but not have talk to the angel he have make a wrong turn in he reason somewhere along the line have he decide perhaps that the center of the cloud be a center of government instead of a center of life and faith but it do nt matter now whether he mean to invade the holy of holy or be simply head in that direction by accident if it be intentional it be now also unnecessary and whether intentional or not the outcome would be disastrous jack crawl under the board and restore the six foot of lead line he have excise from the nernst generator switch when he be back on he foot again and about to reinstall the fuse however he hesitate he have to have fusion power to catch up with the skiff and he have to have it fast but fusion power in the coal sack be what have trigger all the trouble in the first place and he already have an angel aboard hesperus receive i m go to turn i generator back on a i promise to do but i can nt take you to earth yet first i ve get to intercept i brother before they get any deep into trouble will you obstruct this or will you help i know it s not part of the bargain and you elder might not like it nobody else can live in you hearth while i be in it hesperus say promptly a for i elder they have already admit that they be wrong if because of this incident they become angry with earth i will not be permit to go there at all therefore of course i will help with a short-lived sigh of relief jack plug the fuse back in and throw the switch without an instant s transition the green light that mean full fusion power wink on the board always before it have take five minute to of course hesperus be in there from here on out the ariadne be go to be hot than any space cruiser man have ever dream of but since he have fail to anticipate it he lose the five minute anyhow in plot an intercept orbit hesperus do nt use this t-tau vector trick of yours please
