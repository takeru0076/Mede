the missionary obligation to proclaim the gospel to all the world be once leave to zealous individual and voluntary society but the time come when a church that have no part in the missionary movement be look upon a deficient in it essential life the christian education of child too be once hardly more than a sideshow but the day come when a congregation that do not assume full oversight of a church school be think of a fail in it duty the most serious weakness of the ecumenical movement today be that it be generally regard a the responsibility of a few national leader in each denomination and a few interdenominational executive most pastor and layman even though they believe it to be important assume that the ecumenical movement lie outside the province of they parish they may even dismiss it from they mind a something that concern only the ecclesiastical rover boy a someone have dub they who like to go to national and international assembly and have expense account that permit they to do so a long a this point of view prevail the ecumenical movement will be lame and halt the next stage ahead be that of make it thoroughly at home in the local community progress will take place far less through what be do in any summit conference of the national council or the world council or even in office of the denominational board than through what happen in the community where christian people live together a neighbor the front line of advance be where witness and worshiping congregation of different tradition exist side by side until they see the ecumenical movement in term of the difference it make in they own attitude program and relationship it will have an inevitable aspect of unreality a thing now stand there be a grievous disparity between the unity in christ which we profess in ecumenical meeting and the complacent separateness of most congregation on any main street in the nation the ecumenical congregation the crux of ecumenical advance be an even more personalize matter than the relation between congregation in the same community the decisive question be what happen within each congregation and finally in the mind and heart of the individual member it be here that the local and ecumenical must meet it be here that the ecumenical must become local and the local become ecumenical it have become almost trite to say that the ecumenical movement must be carry down to the grass root this way of describe the matter be unfortunate it imply two misconception one be that whatever be ecumenical have to do with some over-all organization at the top and need only to be understand at the so-called low level the truth however be that the ecumenical church be just the local church in it own true character a an integral unit of the whole people of god throughout the world the other misconception be that we ecumenical problem will be solve if only the knowledge of the church in it world-wide extension and it interdenominational connection now comprehend by many national leader can be communicate to all congregation however need this may be the fundamental problem be not information but active commitment to the total mission of the church of christ in the world the basic unit in the church of whatever denominational polity be always the congregation it be hardly possible to emphasize this too much most people do not realize that the congregation a a gather fellowship meet regularly face to face personally share in a common experience and express that experience in daily relationship with one another be unique the idea that it be a feature of all religion be entirely mistake the jewish synagogue afford a parallel to the christian congregation but hinduism buddhism islam confucianism taoism shintoism although they have sacred scripture priest spiritual discipline and place of prayer do not have a congregation a a local household of faith and love they characteristic experience be that of the individual at an altar or a shrine rather than that of a continue social group with a distinctive kind of fellowship how far the fellowship in most local church fall below what the new testament mean by koinonia what be now call christian fellowship be often little more than the social chumminess of have a gracious time with the kind of people one like the koinonia of act and of the epistle mean share in a common relation to christ it be an experience of a new depth of community derive from an awareness of the corporate indwelling of christ in he people a dietrich bonhoffer put it we community with one another consist solely in what christ have do to both of we this may mean have fellowship in the church with people with whom on the level of merely human agreeableness we might prefer not to have any association at all there be a vast difference between the community of reconciliation which the new testament describe and the community of congeniality find in the average church build whenever a congregation really see itself a a unit in the universal church in vital relation with the whole body of christ and participate in he mission to the world a necessary foundation-stone of the ecumenical movement have be lay the antithesis of the ecumenical and the local then no long exist the local and the ecumenical be one of course the perspective of those who be deal directly with the world-wide problem of the people of god will always be different from the perspective of those who be deal with the nearby problem of particular person in a particular place each viewpoint be valid if it be organically relate to the other neither be adequate if it stand alone we difficulty arise when either viewpoint shut out the other and this be what all too often happen divergent perspective a little parable illustrative of this truth be afford by an incident relate by professor bela vasady at the end of the second world war with great difficulty he make he way from he native hungary to geneva to renew he contact a a member of the provisional committee for the world council of church when he have the mishap of break he spectacle he ecumenical colleague insist on provide he with new one they be bifocal he often speak of they a he ecumenical glass and use they a a symbol of the kind of vision that be require in the church it be he say a bifocal vision which can see both the near-at-hand and the distant and keep a christian in right relation to both a thing stand now the local and the ecumenical tend to compete with each other on the one hand there be ecumenists who be so stir by the crisis of the church in it encounter with the world at large that they have no eye for what the church be do in they own town they do not escape the pitfall into which charles dicken picture mrs jellyby a fall she concern for the native of borrioboola-gha be so intense that she quite forget and neglect she son peepy likewise the ecumenist may become so absorb in the conflict of the church with the totalitarian state in east germany the precarious situation of the church in revolutionary china and the anguish of the church over apartheid in south africa that he lose close contact with the parish church in it unspectacular but indispensable ministry of worship pastoral service and counseling and christian nurture for a face-to-face group of individual on the other hand many a pastor be so absorb in minister to the intimate personal need of individual in he congregation that he do little or nothing to lead they into a sense of social responsibility and world mission a a result they go on think of the church with introvert and self-centered satisfaction only in connection with the way in which it serve they and they family it would hardly be an exaggeration to say that ninety per cent of the energy of most church whether in term of finance or spiritual concern be pour into the private and domestic interest of the member the parish life for itself rather than for the community or the world the gap between the ecumenical perspective and the parish perspective appear most starkly in a church in any of we comfortable suburb it be eminently successful accord to all conventional standard it be grow in number it people be agreeable friend it have a beautiful edifice it preach and it music give refreshment of spirit to man and woman live under heavy strain it provide pastoral care for the sick and trouble it help child grow up with at least a nod acquaintance with the bible it draw young people into the circle of those who continue the life of the church from generation to generation and it be easy for the ecumenical enthusiast to lose sight of how basic all this be but what be this church do to help it member understand they role a christian in the world all too often it conception of parish ministry and pastoral care include no responsibility for they in they relation to issue of the most desperate urgency for the life of mankind it be not stir they to confront the racial tension of today with the mind of christ it be not help they face the moral crisis involve in the use of nuclear energy it be not make they sensitive to the sub-christian level of much of we economic and industrial life it be raise no disturb question a to what christian stewardship mean for the relationship of the rich nation in the world to economically underdeveloped people it be not develop an awareness of the new kind of missionary strategy that be call for a young church emerge in asia and africa to put it bluntly many a local church be give it member only what they consciously want it be not disturb they by thought of they christian responsibility in relation to the world we shall not make a decisive advance in the ecumenical movement until such a church begin to see itself not merely a a haven of comfort and peace but a a base of christian witness and mission to the world there be a humorous but reveal story about a rancher who own a large slice of texas and who want to have on it everything that be necessary for a completely pleasant community he build a school and a library then a recreation center and an inn desire to fill the only remain lack he select the good site on the ranch for a chapel and spare no expense in erect it a visitor to the beautiful little build inquire do you belong to this church mr rancher why no maam he reply this church belong to i the story reflect the way too many people feel a long a the congregation regard the church a we church or the minister think of it a i church just so long the ecumenical movement will make no significant advance there must first be a deep sense that the church belong not to we but to christ and that it be he purpose not we own interest and preference that determine what it be to be and do local embodiment of the whole a local church which conceive it function to be entirely that of minister to the conscious desire and concern of it member tend to look on everything ecumenical a an extra not a a normal aspect of it own life a a church it would doubtless be greatly surprise to be tell that in fail to be ecumenical it be really fail to be the church of christ yet the truth accord to the new testament be that every local church have it existence only by be the embodiment of the whole church in that particular place
