there with the fresh breeze on he face he get he hat out of the closet for a moment he think of go into crosson s office to explain that he have to leave but there be now such a pain in he chest such a pound in he head that he decide to let it go he pass the receptionist in the outer office mutter i ve get to go out for a little while let she call crosson if she want to let crosson raise the roof or even can he he do nt care he get into the car put the key into the switch press the accelerator with he foot put the car into reverse seem vast endeavor almost beyond the ability of he shake body once out in the street the traffic be a gadfly maze in which he wander stricken when he turn into the highway that lead to the outskirts of the city and then rise toward home he have to pull over to the curb and wait for a few minute suck in air and squint and blink he eye to clear they of tear what on earth be in mae s mind that she want he up there spy on what the cop be do what do she think he could do he try to ignore what he own common sense tell he but it be nt possible she motive be too blatant she want he to get into trouble she want the police to notice he suspect he she be go to keep on scheme poke prod suggest and dictate until the cop get up enough interest in he to go back to they old neighborhood and ask question and he know in that moment with a cold sink of despair a die of old hope that mae have spread some kind of word there among the neighbor nothing bald open but enough they d have some suspicion to repeat to the police though he inner thought cringe at it he force himself to think back recreat the scene in which mae claim to have catch he molest the child it have nt amount to anything there have be nothing evil or dirty in he intention a second scene flash before he mind the interior of the garage at the new house and the young bartlett girl turn startle to meet he the dim dark and the sudden confusion and fear and then the brightness a mae have click on the light suppose the cop somehow get hold of that well it have nt be what it seem he d have no idea the girl be in there he have nt touch she and when he come to examine the scene there be a certain staginess to it it have the smell of plan and a swift suspicion dart into he mind too monstrous of course mae would nt have plot a thing like that it be just that little accident play into she hand like this murder he lean on the wheel clutch it stare into the sunlight and try to bring order into he thought he feel light-headed and sick there be no use wander off into a territory of utter nightmare mae be he wife she be marry to he for good or for bad she would nt be wilfully plan he destruction but she be she be even a the conviction of truth roar through he shatter he last hope of safety he be reach to release the hand brake to head up the road for home do she bid he drive and the road wobble familiar scene creep past on either side he come to a stretch of old orange grove the tree dead some of they uproot and then there be an outlying shop area and tract house he have the feel that he should abandon the car and run off somewhere to hide but he could nt imagine where there be really no place to go finally except home to mae at the gate he slow look around cooper be beside he car on the curb at the right just stand there morosely he do nt even look up behind he on the step of the little office sit old man arthur he be straight something angry in he attitude a if he might be wait to report something holden step on the gas a new idea drift in from nowhere he could go to the police he could tell they he fear of be involve he could explain what have happen in the old neighborhood and how mae have misunderstand and how she have hold it over he the scene be complete in he mind at the moment even to he own jerking and snivelings and ferguson s silent patience he could throw himself on the mercy of the police department it be nt what mae would want he to do though he be sure of this once he have abandon himself to the very bad once he have quiet all the dragon of worry and suspense there would nt be very much for mae to do at that moment holden almost slam on the brake to go back to cooper and ask if ferguson be about it would be such a relief what be that old sign suppose to be paint over a door somewhere abandon hope all you who enter here why holden say to himself surprise at he own sudden insight i ll bet some of those people who enter be just a happy a can be they ve worry they ve lie awake night they ve shake at the slight footstep they ve picture they own destruction and now it s all over and they can give up sure they re give up hope hand in hand with hope go thing like terror and apprehension good-bye holden wave a hand at the empty street glad to see you go he drive into the pave space before the garage and get out slam the car door he look up and down the street if ferguson s car have be in sight holden would have walk directly to it he go to the front door and open it and look in mae enter the room from the hallway to the kitchen she have a cup of something steam coffee perhaps in one hand a fresh piece of toast in the other she stand there watch holden come in and she put the piece of toast in she mouth and bit off one corner with a huge chomp of she white tooth mae i ve be think she say swallow the toast do nt you have an old pair of painting overall in the garage you use they that time you paint the porch at we other house and then you wipe up some grease she have catch he off guard no preparation nothing certain but
