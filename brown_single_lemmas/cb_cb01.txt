this country limit it ability to fight any kind of war besides a nuclear war this strategy heighten the possibility that we would have a nuclear war it also weaken we diplomatic stance because russia could easily guess we do not desire a nuclear war except in the ultimate extremity this leave the soviet plenty of leeway to start low-grade brushfire aggression with considerable impunity by maintain the nuclear deterrent but gear american military force to fight conventional war too secretary of state rusk junk bluff and nuclear brinkmanship and build more muscle and great safety into we military

budget for this year the firm do a large amount of research and it forecast have mean it be good to know that georgia will continue to have sufficient electrical power not only to meet the demand of normal growth but to encourage a more rapid rate of industrialization georgia s mental health program receive a badly need boost from the general assembly in the form of a $ 1750000 budget increase for the milledgeville state hospital actually it amount to $ 1250000 above what the institution already be receive consider the additional half-million dollar gov vandiver allocate last year from the state surplus either way it sound like a sizable hunk of money and be but exactly how far it will go toward improve condition be another question because there be so much that need do the practice of charge employe for meal whether they eat at the hospital or not should be abolish the work week of attendant who be on duty 65 hour and more per week should be reduce more attendant nurse and doctor should be hire patient deserve more attention than they be get even with the increase in fund for the next fiscal year georgia will be spend only around $ 315 per day per patient the national average be more than $ 4 and that figure be consider by expert in the mental health field to be too low kansas regard a top in the nation in it treatment of the mentally ill spend $ 9 per day per patient georgia have make some reform true the intensive treatment program be work well but in so many other area we still be drag consider what be be do compare to what need to be do it behooves the hospital management to do some mighty careful plan toward make the good possible use of the increase grant the boost be helpful but inadequate the end of trujillo assassination even of a tyrant be repulsive to man of good conscience rafael trujillo the often blood-thirsty dictator of the dominican republic for 31 year perhaps deserve he fate in an even-handed appraisal of history but whether the murder of el benefactor in ciudad trujillo mean freedom for the people of the caribbean fiefdom be a question that can not now be answer trujillo know a great deal about assassination the responsibility for score of death include the abduction and murder of jesus maria galindez a professor at columbia university in new york have be lay at he door he have be involve in countless scheme to do away with democratic leader in neighboring country such a president romulo betancourt of venezuela it be a sort of poetic justice that at the time of he own demise a new plot to overthrow the venezuelan government reportedly involve the use of dominican arm by former venezuelan dictator marcos perez jimenez have be uncover and quash the recent history of the dominican republic be an almost classical study of the way in which even a professedly benevolent dictatorship tend to become oppressive unquestionably trujillo do some good thing for he country he improve public facility such a road and sanitation attract industry and investment and raise the standard of live notably but the price be the silence of the grave for all criticism or opposition el benefactor s vanity grow with he personal wealth the jail be fill to overflow with political prisoner who have incur he displeasure he maintain amply finance lobby in the unite state and elsewhere which sycophantically chant he praise and he influence extend even to congress until the last year or so the profession of friendship with the unite state have be an article of faith with trujillo and altogether too often this profession be accept here a evidence of he good character tardily the government here come to understand how this country s own reputation be tarnish by the association with repression last year after trujillo have be cite for numerous aggression in the caribbean the unite state and many other member of the organization of american state break diplomatic relation with he thereupon follow a demonstration that tyranny know no ideological confine trujillo s dictatorship have be along conservative right-wing line but after the censure he and he propaganda start mouth communist slogan there be considerable evidence of a tacit rapprochement with castro in cuba previously a bete noire to trujillo thus illustrate the way in which totalitarianism of the right and leave coalesce what come after trujillo be now the puzzle the dominican people have know no democratic institution and precious little freedom for a generation and all alternative leadership have be suppress perhaps the army will be able to maintain stability but the vacuum of free institution create a great danger the dominican republic could turn toward communist-type authoritarianism a easily a toward western freedom such a twist would be a tragedy for the dominican people who deserve to breathe without fear for that reason any democratic reform and effort to bring genuine representative government to the dominican republic will need the great sympathy and help start on rapid transit high-speed bus on the george washington memorial parkway operate between downtown washington and cabin john glen echo and brookmont would constitute an alluring sample of what the new national capital transportation agency can do for this city in present plan for such express bus before the montgomery county council the administrator of the ncta c darwin stolzenbach be frankly seek support for the project he agency will soon be launch such support should not be difficult to come by if all the plan to be present by the ncta be a attractive a this outline of express bus come into the downtown area because the bus would not stop on the parkway land for bus station and for park area nearby will be need the ncta be well advise to seek fund for this purpose from the present session of congress
