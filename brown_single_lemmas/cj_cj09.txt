a variety of technique have be direct toward the isolation and study of blood group antibody these include low-temperature ethanol cohn fractionation electrophoresis ultracentrifugation and column chromatography on ion exchange cellulose modification of the last technique have be apply by several group of investigator abelson and rawson use a stepwise elution scheme fractionate whole sera contain abo and rh antibody on diethylaminoethyl deae cellulose and carboxymethyl cellulose speer and coworker in a similar study of blood group antibody of whole sera use a series of gradient for elution from afj fahey and morrison use a single continuous gradient at constant ph for the fractionation of anti-a and anti-b agglutinins from preisolated \*\* yg-globulin sample in the present work whole sera have be fractionate by chromatography on deae-cellulose use single gradient similar to those describe by sober and peterson and certain chemical and serological property of the fraction contain antibody of the abo and rh system have be describe material and method sample serum sample be obtain from normal group a group b and group o donor three of the anti-rh sera use be take from recently sensitize individual one contain complete antibody and have a titer of 1 512 in saline the second contain incomplete antibody and show titers of 1 256 in albumin and 1 2048 by the indirect coomb test the third contain the mix type of complete and incomplete antibody have titers of 1 256 in saline 1 512 in albumin and 1 1024 by the indirect coomb test in addition one serum be obtain from a donor re who have be sensitize 6 year previously this serum exhibit titers of 1 16 in albumin and 1 256 by the indirect coomb test these antibody titers be determine by reaction with homozygous afj red cell serological technique anti-a and anti-b activity be determine in fraction from the sera of group a group b or group o donor by the follow tube agglutination method one drop of each sample be add to one drop of a 2 % suspension of group afj or group b red cell in a small afj test tube in several instance group o cell be also use a control the red cell be use within 2 day after donation and be wash with large amount of saline before use the mixture of sample plus cell suspension be allow to stand at room temperature for 1 afj the tube be then centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examine macroscopically for agglutination for the albumin method equal volume of 30 % bovine albumin sample and 2 % cell suspend in saline be allow to stand at room temperature for 1 hr and then be centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 1 afj all sample be test by both the saline and albumin method the activity of fraction of sera contain rh antibody be test by the saline albumin and indirect coomb technique homozygous and heterozygous afj cell afj and homozygous and heterozygous afj cell be use to test each sample however in the interest of clarity and conciseness only the result obtain with homozygous afj and homozygous afj cell will be present here the saline and albumin test be perform a describe for the abo sample except that the mixture be incubate for 1 hr at 37-degrees-c before centrifugation the saline tube be save and use for the indirect coomb test in the follow manner the cell be wash three time with saline anti-human serum be add the cell be resuspend and the mixture be centrifuge at 1000 rpm for 1 min and examine for agglutination the anti-human sera use be prepare by inject whole human serum into rabbit those antisera show by immunoelectrophoresis to be of the broad spectrum type be select for use in the present study the red cell for the rh antibody test be use within 3 day after draw except for the afj cell which have be glycerolized and store at -20-degrees-c for approximately 1 year these cell be thaw at 37-degrees-c for 30 min and be deglycerolized by alternately centrifuge and mix with descend concentration of glycerol solution 20 18 10 8 4 and 2 % the cell be then wash three time with saline and resuspend to 2 % in saline chromatography blood sample be allow to clot at room temperature for 3 hr centrifuge and the serum be remove the serum be measure volumetrically and subsequently dialyzed in the cold for at least 24 hr against three to four change approximately 750 ml each of start buffer this buffer ph 86 be 0005 m in afj and 0039 m in tris hydroxymethyl -aminometha tris after dialysis the sample be centrifuge and the supernatant place on a afj cm column of eeae-cellulose equilibrate with start buffer the deae-cellulose contain 078 meq of n be prepare in we laboratory by the method of peterson and sober 7 from powder cellulose 100 - 230 mesh the small amount of insoluble material which precipitate during dialysis be suspend in approximately 5 ml of start buffer centrifuge resuspend in 25 ml of isotonic saline and test for antibody activity the chromatography be do at 6-degrees-c use gradient elution essentially accord to sober and peterson the deep concave gradient employ fig 2 be obtain with a nine-chambered gradient elution device varigrad reference 8 and have be describe elsewhere the other a shallow concave gradient fig 1 be produce with a so-called cone-sphere apparatus the cone be a 2-liter erlenmeyer flask and the sphere a 2-liter round-bottom flask each initially contain 1700 ml of buffer in the sphere be start buffer and in the cone be final buffer 050 m in both afj and tris ph 41 a flow rate of 72 afj be use and 12 ml fraction be collect approximately 165 fraction be obtain from each column these be read at 280 m \*\* ym in a beckman model do spectrophotometer and test for antibody activity a describe above paper electrophoresis for protein identification fraction from the column be concentrate by pervaporation against a stream of air at 5-degrees-c or by negative pressure dialysis in an apparatus which permit simultaneous concentration of the protein and dialysis against isotonic saline during the latter procedure the temperature be maintain at 2-degrees-c by surround the apparatus with ice because negative pressure dialysis give good recovery of protein permit detection of protein concentrate from very dilute solution and be a gentl procedure it be use in all but the early experiment paper electrophoresis be carry out on the concentrate sample in a spinco model r cell use barbital buffer ph 86 ionic strength 0075 at room temperature on whatman 3mm filter paper five milliamperes be apply for 18 hr after which the strip be stain with bromphenol blue and densitometry be carry out use a spinco analytrol when paper electrophoresis be to be use for preparation eight strip of a whole serum sample or a chromatographic fraction concentrate by negative pressure dialysis be run under the condition describe above at the end of the run the strip in the third and sixth position in each chamber be dry stain for 1 hr wash and dry while the other strip be maintain in a horizontal position at 1-degree-c the unstained strip be then mark use the stain one a a guide and cut transversely so a to separate the various protein band the strip section contain a give protein be pool elute with 05 ml of isotonic saline and the eluate be test for antibody activity ultracentrifugation fraction from the column which be to be subject to analytical ultracentrifugation be concentrate by negative pressure dialysis and dialyzed for 16 hr in the cold against at least 500 volume of phosphate-buffered saline ph 72 ionic strength 0154 they be then centrifuge at 59780 pm for 35 to 80 min at 20-degrees-c in a spinco model e ultracentrifuge at a protein concentration of 100 to 125 % sedimentation coefficient be compute a afj value and relative amount of the various component be calculate from the schlieren pattern for preparative ultracentrifugation fraction from the column be concentrate by negative pressure dialysis to volume of 1 ml or less transfer to cellulose tube and dilute to 12 ml with isotonic saline ultracentrifugation be then carry out in a spinco model l ultracentrifuge at 40000 rpm for 125 to 150 min refrigeration be use throughout the run successive 1-ml fraction be then draw off with a hypodermic syringe start at the top of the tube and test for agglutinin activity other method will be describe below experimental and result the insoluble material which precipitate during dialysis against start buffer always show intense agglutinin activity regardless of the blood group of the donor with either of the gradient describe chromatography on deae-cellulose separate agglutinins of the abo series into at least three region fig 1 and 2 one of extremely low anionic bind capacity one of low anionic bind capacity and one of high anionic bind capacity these have be label region 1 2 and 4 respectively in fig 1 when the early part of the gradient be flatten either by use the gradient show in fig 2 or by allow the cone-sphere gradient to become establish more slowly region 2 activity could sometimes be separate into two area donor pj and rs fig 1 and em fig 2 the latter procedure give rise to a small active protein peak region 1a between region 1 and 2 in 2 of 15 experiment on whole serum a region of agglutinin activity with intermediate anionic bind capacity be detect region 3 fig 1 moreover after concentration use negative pressure dialysis agglutinin activity could sometimes be detect in the region designate 2a donor pj da and jf fig 1 not all these region exhibit equal agglutinate activity a evidence by titer and the extent of the active area in all case most of the activity lie in the region of high anionic bind capacity this be particularly noticeable in group a and group b sera in which case activity in region 1 and 2 be usually not detectable without prior concentration and occasionally could not be detect at all there appear to be no difference in the distribution of anti-a and anti-b activity in group o serum though in two group o donor jf and em only one type of agglutinin be find in the region of low anionic bind capacity fig 1 and 2 several sample of citrate plasma be fractionate in we laboratory by method 6 of cohn et al these fraction be test for abo agglutinin activity use fraction from group ab plasma a a control a expect most of the activity be find in fraction afj with slight activity see in fraction 4-1 a sample of fraction afj from group o plasma be dissolve in start buffer dialyzed against this buffer and subject to chromatography use the gradient show in fig 2 once again both anti-a and anti-b activity be find in the insoluble material precipitate during dialysis similarly both type of antibody be find in three region of the chromatographic eluate have extremely low low and high anionic bind capacity respectively fig 3 chromatography of whole sera reveal that the area of rh antibody activity be generally continuous and wide the incomplete antibody activity appear in the early part of the chromatogram the complete in the latter part the serum contain the mix type of complete and incomplete antibody show activity in both region fig 1 in all case the activity against afj cell be spread over a wide area than that with afj cell regardless of the type of test saline albumin indirect coomb use for comparison the insoluble material result from dialysis against start buffer always show strong activity in fact agglutination of afj cell in saline could be produce by the insoluble material from sera contain only incomplete antibody activity this be late know to be the result of concentrate the minute amount of complete antibody find in these sera when the insoluble fraction be suspend in a volume of saline equal to that of the original serum sample no complete antibody activity could be detect
