man need unity and they need god care must be take neither to confuse unity with uniformity nor god with we parochial idea about he but with these two qualification the statement stand the statement also point to a classic paradox the more man turn toward god who be not only in himself the paradigm of all unity but also the only ground on which human unity can ultimately be establish the more man splinter into group and set themselves apart from one another to be remind of this we need only glance at the world map and note the extent to which religious division have compound political one with a resultant fragmentation of the human race massacre attend the partition of india and the establishment of the state of israel be simply recent grim evidence of the hostility such division can engender the word of cardinal newman come forcibly to mind oh how we hate one another for the love of god the source of this paradox be not difficult to identify it lie in institution institution require structure form and definition and these in turn entail differentiation and exclusion a completely amorphous institution would be a contradiction in term to escape this fate it must rule some thing out for every criterion which define what something be at the same time proclaim implicitly if not openly what that something be not some person be so sensitive to this truth a to propose that we do away with institution altogether in the present context this amount to the advice that while be religious may have a certain justification we ought to dispense with church the suggestion be naive man be at once a gregarious animal and a form-creating be have once commit himself to an ideal which he consider worthwhile he inevitably create form for it expression and institution for it continuance to propose that man be religious without have religious institution be like propose that they be learn without have school both eventuality be possible logically but practically they be impossible a much a man intrinsically need the unity that be ground in god they instrumentally require the institution that will direct they step toward he yet the fact remain that such institution do set man at odds with they fellow be there any way out of the predicament the only way that i can see be through communication interfaith communication need not be regard a an unfortunate burden visit upon we by the necessity of maintain diplomatic relation with we adversary approach creatively it be a high art it be the art of relate the finite to the infinite of do we good to insure that the particularistic requirement of religious institution will not thwart god s intent of unity among man more than be minimally necessary in a certain sense interfaith communication parallel diplomatic communication among the nation-state what be the pertinent fact affect such communication at the present juncture of history i shall touch on three area personal national and theological 1 by personal factor i mean those root in personality structure some interfaith tension be not occasion by theological difference at all but by the need of man to have person they can blame distrust denounce and even hate such need may rise to pathological proportion modern psychology have show that parallel the authoritarian personality be the bigoted personality in which insecurity inferiority suspicion and distrust combine to provide a target for antagonism so indispensable that it will be manufacture if it do not exist naturally fortunately the number of pathological bigot appear to be quite small but it would be a mistake to think that more than a matter of degree separate they from the rest of we to some extent the personal inadequacy that prejudice attempt to compensate for be to be find in all of we interfaith conflict which spring from psychological deficiency be the most unfortunate of all for they have no redeem feature whatsoever it be difficult to say what can be do about they except that we must learn to recognize when it be they rather than pretext for they that be cause the trouble and do everything possible to nurture the healthy personality that will prevent the development of such deficiency 2 while the personality factor that aggravate interfaith conflict may be perennial nationalism be more variable the specific instance i have in mind be the afro-asian version which have gain prominence only in this second half of the twentieth century emerge from the two century of colonial domination the afro-asian world be aflame with a nationalism that have undo empire no less than twenty-two nation have already achieve independence since world war 2 and the number be grow by the year a an obvious consequence obstacle to genuine interfaith communication have grow more formidable in one important area relation between christian and non-christian in these land colonialism alone would have be able to make these difficulty serious for christianity be so closely tie to colonialism in the mind of these people that repudiation of the one have tend automatically toward the repudiation of the other actually however this turn out to be only part of the picture nationalism have abet not only the repudiation of foreign religion but the revival of native one some of which have be lie in slumber for century the truth be that any revival of traditional and indigenous religion will serve to promote that sense of identity and volksgeist which these young nation very much need insofar a these nation claim to incarnate tradition and way of life which constitute ultimate trans-political justification for they existence such people be inevitably lead to emphasize the way in which these tradition and way be theirs rather than someone else s all this work severely against the kind of cross-cultural communication for which christian mission stand african and asian tend to consider not only mission but the local church they have produce a center and agent of western culture and ideology if not of direct political propaganda the people hard hit by this suspicion be of course christian on the mainland of china but the problem extend elsewhere for example in burma and ceylon many buddhist argue that buddhism ought to be the official state religion in 1960 ceylon nationalize it sectarian preponderantly christian school to the rejoice of most of it 7000000 buddhist and the lament of it 800000 roman catholic again india have impose formidable barrier against the entrance of additional missionary and fanatical hindu party be expect to seek far action against christian once the influence make for tolerance due to nehru and he follower be go the progressive close of afro-asian ear to the christian message be epitomize in a conversation i have three year ago while fly from jerusalem to cairo i be seat next to the director of the seventh day adventist world radio program he say that on he tour the precede year a considerable number of hour would have be available to he on japanese radio network but that he have then lack the fund to contract for they after return to the unite state and raise the money he discover on get back to japan that the hour be no long available it be not that they have be contract for during the interval they simply could no long be purchase for missionary purpose it be not unfair to add on the other side that the crude and almost vitriolic approach of certain fundamentalist sect toward the culture and religion among which they work have contribute measurably to this heighten of anti-christian sentiment ironically these be the group which have double or triple they missionary effort since world war 2 while the more establish denomination be barely maintain pre-war staff although i have emphasize the barrier which an arouse nationalism have raise against relation between christian and non-christian in asia the fact be that this development have also widen the gulf between certain afro-asian religion themselves the partition of india have hardly improve relation between hindu and muslim neither have the establishment of the state of israel foster harmony between muslim and jew 3 i turn finally to several theological development 1 theocracy reconsider the modern world have be mark by progressive disaffection with claim to divine sanction for the state whatever it political form the american constitution be historic at this point in provide that congress shall make no law respect an establishment of religion or prohibit the free exercise thereof one of we foremost jurist david dudley field have go so far a to call this provision the great achievement ever make in the course of human history the trend throughout the world s religion have be toward a recognition of at least the practical validity of this constitutional enactment pakistan be create in 1947 expressly a a muslim state but when the army take over eleven year late it do so on a wave of mass impatience which be direct in part against the inability of political and religious leader to think they way through to the mean of islam for the modern political situation what be the point charles adam report the pakistani a ask in demand an islamic state and society if no one not even the doctor of the sacred law themselves can say clearly and succinctly what the nature of such a state and society be the current regime of president mohammad ayub khan be determinedly secular and while the nation be formerly name the islamic republic of pakistan it be now simply the republic of pakistan comparable trend can be note elsewhere the new regime in turkey be intentionally less muslim than it predecessor the religious party in israel have experience a great loss of prestige in recent month during the year when israel be pass from crisis to crisis the sinai campaign the infusion of multitude of penniless immigrant it be feel that the purpose of national unity could be good serve if the secular majority be to yield to the religious party now that israel enjoy relative prosperity and a reduction of tension the secularist be less dispose to compromise and in this country gustave weigel s delineation of the line between the sacral and secular order during the last presidential campaign serve to provide a most impressive roman catholic defense of the practical autonomy of both church and state the failure at that time of the puerto rican bishop to control the vote of they people add a ring of good sense to father weigel s theological argument everywhere there seem to be a grow recognition of the fact that government and religious institution alike be too fallible and corruptible in a word too human to warrant any claim of maintain partnership with the divine 2 salvation reconsider i father go a a missionary to china in a generation that respond to student volunteer movement speaker who hold watch in they hand and announce to the student in they audience how many chinese soul be go to hell each second because these student be not over there save they that mention of this should bring smile to we lip today be a clear an indication a we could wish of the extent to which attitude have change i do not mean to imply that christian have adopt the liberal assumption so prevalent in hinduism that all religion be merely different path to the same summit leslie newbiggin reflect the dominant position within the world council of church when he say we must claim absoluteness and finality for christ and he finish work but that very claim forbid we to claim absoluteness and finality for we understand of it newbiggin s qualification on the christian claim be of considerable significance the roman catholic church have excommunicate one of it priest father feeney for insist that there be no salvation outside the visible church in mention this under salvation reconsider i do not mean to imply that roman catholic doctrine have change in this area but rather that it have become clear to the world community what that doctrine be
