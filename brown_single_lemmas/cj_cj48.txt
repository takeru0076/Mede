the summary report on desegregation progress in education in the middle-south region 1959 - 1960 clearly show two piece of information the summary report which be prepare for this conference indicate first that actual or pending school desegregation be increase second that both actual and pending desegregation be with few exception the product or result of court order the report together with other information suggest that desegregation in the school be slow the middle-south region a define by the national association of intergroup relation official nairo consist of the state of kentucky maryland tennessee west virginia delaware virginia and the district of columbia the state and the nation s capital all have some desegregation in fact some date back to 1954 but the region also embrace some of the staunch opposition desegregation have be oppose by massive resistance interposition pupil assignment with no assignment of negro child and hate bombing desegregation and court order now let s look at the evidence that show the increase in desegregation and such increase a a result of court order first kentucky elementary school desegregation come to owen and union county which already have high school desegregation the action be a result of a court order the citation for which and for other court action mention in this paper be take from the summary report for this conference in maryland the harford county board of education have prepare a desegregation plan which the court approve but which a plaintiff have challenge thus county school board and federal court join hand here to promote school desegregation additional school desegregation in tennessee result from a court order open a school serve child of military personnel similarly far desegregation may come from suit pending in three tennessee city chattanooga knoxville and memphis in west virginia the number of white and negro child attend the same school have increase almost twofold there be no court decision here a in maryland a district court have approve an official plan of school desegregation in delaware a a result of the state board of education plan negro child enter heretofore white elementary school in five district the third circuit court of appeal be review an appeal from the plan in virginia court order lead to desegregation in charlottesville and floyd county desegregation in pulaski county be pending because of court order although date of admission be not yet determine negro parent have file application for admission of additional child to school in alexandria arlington fairfax and warren county desegregation can also result from additional suit bring by negro plaintiff against school board in newport news fairfax county arlington county and norfolk a a school district the district of columbia have have desegregated school since 1954 shortly after the supreme court decision this recapitulation make it clear that school desegregation continue include the old dominion state in spite of it stern resistance the record be clear that increase in school desegregation last year come largely a a result of a court order that on the immediate horizon if far large-scale relatively speak desegregation come it will result from court order on suit file in several middle-south state knowledge that thousands of school district be involve and observation that school desegregation have occur in only a handful in 1959-1960 lead to a conclusion that desegregation-from-court-order be slow before turn to i view a to the problem and issue before we at this regional conference i wish to note a small item in the summary report a it refer to the district of columbia that reference in the report be continuation of the trend toward an all-negro school system a remark apparently occasion by the increase of negro school population from 741 per cent to 767 per cent i see no real prospect for an all-negro school population west of rock creek park be still monolithically white and be in fact increasingly white a a result of georgetown s conversion-by-renovation house program nearby foggy bottom be oust negroes the large acreage in the southwest redevelopment area beckon white people what with high-priced town house and elevator apartment the capitol hill rehabilitation like foggy bottom replace negroes with white but also replace some white with other white the sharpe break with tradition the past and present of white ring around a black core may come with the open of nearby montgomery county suburb to negro resident and presumably the consequent conclusion of some white that they can not escape the negro by flee to the suburb in fact short of flee to warrenton virginia or rockville maryland white people may have to live with negroes all of this must be take into account before the image of an all-negro dc public school system be conjure up problem to solve from the summary report before we at this conference a number of problem be apparent they vex we and perplex we but generally do not divide we like the issue which follow the problem first how can we step up the desegregation movement it be slow i believe we all want more school where white and negro together can and do attend i believe we all want no child deny admission to a school on account of he color in general member of nairo would certainly want a child admit to a school near he residence or within he residence zone how to achieve this objective be a problem but we be not divide on what we want second a we increase the number of desegregated school district and school themselves how can we achieve this action through school board action it may be county school board or state school board action a well a that of municipal school board correlatively can we reduce the role of the district court so that the action be that of the people of the community or other school district and not that of the law court this be a problem and i believe there be little difference of opinion that wherever possible a local school board should devise and effect a plan of desegregation third how can we insure a systematic and continue group relation education in the school not simply a brief program when the school be actually desegregated but a continue program that also promote integration that encourage the child and teacher not to look at each other a white or negro but a human being again the problem be how to get it do and in what form to offer the group relation education not whether it should be do fourth in the segregate school system during the period before desegregation how can we assure equal opportunity in fact in the desegregated school system which may have a good many school with all-negro population how can we assure equal opportunity this be a problem but we be not divide over it importance or by it existence fifth in the segregate school system or in the all-negro or all-white school how can we encourage good group relation or an improve attitude toward people who do not belong to the group can we help child adjust to image of other child when the latter be not actually present now the issue if we have five problem whose solution we seek in relatively unite fashion then there be twice a many issue which i judge sharply divide we intergroup relation practitioner and lie people issue no 1 pupil assignment since on the one hand school desegregation have come in virginia hand-in-glove with pupil assignment shall we support the plan on the basis of pupil assignment criterion judge albert bryan have assign negro child to formerly white school in arlington and alexandria virginia shall we support pupil assignment on the other hand look at the large picture be it true that pupil assignment have effectively cut off block or reduce school desegregation to a trickle shall we therefore oppose the plan this question be an issue because it likely divide we into two camp those for or against pupil assignment issue no 2 teacher assignment in order to desegregate in large city like baltimore louisville and washington dc should school desegregation be extend to all-negro and all-white school by assign white and negro teacher respectively on the one hand do we argue the supreme court decision require only that a child not be deny admission to a school on account of he race or should we argue that if we want adjustment of child to child of different race and that that be impossible in an all-something-or-the-other school we must at least provide he some opportunity to adjust to people of another race within the school namely to a teacher of another race we can argue that where residence make pupil desegregation impossible teacher assignment can create a partially desegregated situation issue no 3 the plaintiff in school desegregation case the early part of i statement deal with the court order that result in desegregation in each instance the plaintiff be a private citizen in thousands of school district indeed in the entire state of mississippi no plaintiff have come forth and i have establish that the action of municipal county or state school board or board of education be small infinitesimally small in comparison with the number of district be the requirement that the plaintiff be a person actually deny admission to a school a sound requirement should congress authorize the attorney general to file suit to accomplish admission of a child to a school to which he be deny entrance even though in civil right legislation in 1957 and 1960 the provision for the attorney general to act be eliminate should we nevertheless support such a clause this be an issue for it divide people rather sharply issue no 4 withhold of fund to school that deny child on account of race this be the powell amendment which in 1957 divide even a liberal group like the american veteran committee avc should we support a clause in federal school construction or school assistance legislation that would deny federal fund to a school district that deny admission to a child on account of he race this be soft than early powell amendment which would have deny fund to all segregate school district there be nonetheless considerable argument against the clause soften though it be on the ground that federal aid be so necessary to the public school the federal fund limitation enlist the support of many the opposition of quite a few issue no 5 require public education should a political subdivision state or county or municipality be require to furnish public education for the school year 1959-1960 the prince edward county virginia board of supervisor vote not to provide fund for public education and the school board therefore could provide no public education for white or negro child be public education in this american democracy of such importance that no child should be deny public education or be this subject a matter of self-determination a matter of state right or county right if people do nt want to provide public education should they be force to do so even if we marshal substantial agreement behind mandatory public education we likely can not expect that all the state will enact the legislation should the requirement which must therefore be federal in nature be legislate by the unite state congress or must it become law by amendment of the unite state constitution we actually have two issue in this question goal and method issue no 6 federal responsibility for education of the citizen if the above issue be settle by require public education for all citizen issue no 6 may be moot if on the other hand it be not settle or while it be be debate and resolve do the federal government have a responsibility in situation like that in prince edward county nearly half the child still receive no education must or should the federal government help should the government directly provide education for the child who want public education
