ramsey have a thing or two to mutter about himself for the dallas defensive unit turn in another splendid effort against denver and the texan be able to whip the dangerous broncs without the fullbacking of a top star jack spike though he do the team s place-kicking while nurse a knee injury we interior line and out linebacker play exceptionally well say stram monday after he and he staff review movie of the game in fact we whole defensive unit do a good job the texan win the game through ball control with quarterback cotton davidson throw only 17 pass we always like to keep the ball a much a we can against denver because they have such an explosive attack explain stram they can be go along do little damage then bang bang they can hit a couple of pass on you for touchdown and put you in trouble the broncs do hit two quick strike in the final period against the texan but dallas have enough of a lead to hold they off the principal tactic in control the ball be give it to abner haynes the flashy halfback he be call upon 26 time more than all of the other ball-carriers combine and deliver 145 yard the texan make themselves a comfort break on the open kickoff when denver s al carmichael be jar loose from the ball when dave grayson the speedy halfback hit he and guard al reynolds claim it for dallas a quick touchdown result that permit we to start control the ball right away say stram quip i think i ll put that play in the book the early southwest conference football leader texas arkansas and texas a & m make a big dent in the statistics last week texas 545-yard
