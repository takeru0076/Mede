d singer and john b turner of miami no complaint or charge have be file during the past year either verbally or write from any individual or group the committee continue to feel that florida have progress in a sound and equitable program at both the state and local level in it effort to review and assess transition problem a they arise from time to time in the entire spectrum of civil right problem have arise in this sensitive field but have be handle in most case with understand and restraint the progress report by the advisory committee be real while some think we move too fast and other too slowly florida s record be a good one and stand out among the 50 west germany remain western west germany will face the crucial test that lie ahead on berlin and unification with a coalition government this be the key fact emerge from sunday s national election chancellor adenauer s christian democratic party slip only a little in the vote but it be enough to lose the absolute bundestag majority it have enjoy since 1957 in order to form a new government it must deal with one of the two rival party which gain strength inevitably this mean some compromise the age chancellor in all likelihood will be retire both willy brandt s social democrat who gain 22 seat in the new parliament and the free democrat who pick up 23 will insist on that before they enter the government moon-faced ludwig erhart the economic expert probably will ascend to the leadership long deny he if he become chancellor dr erhart would make few change the wizard who fashion west germany s astonish industrial rebirth be the soul of free enterprise he be dedicate to build the nation s strength and a be all west german to a free berlin and to reunion with captive east germany what be in doubt a the free german and they ally consider the vote trend be the nature of the coalition that will result if the party of adenauer and erhart with 45 per cent of the vote approach the party of willy brandt which win 36 per cent the result would be a stiffen of the old resolve west berlin s mayor brandt vigorously demand a firm stand on the dismemberment of he city and win vote by it the free democrat 12 per cent of the vote believe a nuclear war can be avoid by negotiate with the soviet union and more dealing with the communist bloc the question leave by the election be whether west germany veer slightly toward more firmness or more flexibility it could go either way since the gain for both point of view be about the same regardless of the decision two fact be clear west germany with it industrial and military might reaffirm it democracy and remain firm with the free nation and the career of konrad adenauer who upheld germany s tradition of rock-like leader which bismarck begin draw near the end good ask before join american be a nation of joiner a quality which we friend find endear and sometimes amuse but it can be dangerous if the joiner do nt want to make a spectacle of himself for instance so-called conservative organization some of they secret be sprout in the garden of join where liberal organization once take root one specific example be a secret fraternity which will coordinate anti-communist effort the principle be commendable but we suspect that in the practice somebody be go to get gull accord to the chicago tribune news service state atty gen stanley mosk of california have devise a series of question which the joiner might well ask about any organization seek he money and he name 1 do it assail school and church with blanket accusation 2 do it attack other traditional american institution with unsupportable and wild charge 3 do it put the label of un-american or subversive on everyone with whom it disagree politically 4 do it attempt to rewrite modern history by blame american statesman for war communism depression and other trouble of the world 5 do it employ crude pressure tactic with such mean a anonymous telephone call and letter write campaign 6 do it spokesman seem more interest in the amount of money they collect than in the principle they purport to advocate in some instance a seventh question can be add 7 do the organization show an affinity for a foreign government political party or personality in opposition or preference to the american system if the would-be joiner ask these question he be not likely to be dupe by extremist who be seek to capitalize on the confusion and the patriotic apprehension of american in a trouble time fall somewhere in a category between einstein s theory and sand flea difficult to see but undeniably there nevertheless be the tropical green city of islandia a string of offshore island that have almost no resident limit access and an unlimited future the latter be what concern we all whatever land you can see here from the north tip end of elliott key look southward belong to someone people who have title to the land and what you can nt see the land underneath the water belong to someone too the public the only real problem be to devise a plan whereby the owner of the above-water land can develop they property without the public lose it underwater land and the right to it development for public use and enjoyment in the fairly brief but hectic history of florida the developer of waterfront land have too often wind up with both they land and ours in this instance happily insistence be be make that we share be protect and until this protection be at least a concrete a say the row of hotel that bar we from we own sand at miami beach those who represent we all should agree to nothing close door in city hall the reaction of certain city council member to california s new anti-secrecy law be a dismay a it be disappoint we have assume that at least this local legislative body have nothing to hide and therefore have no objection to make the deliberation of it committee and the city commission available to the public in the preamble to the open-meeting statute collectively know a the word act the legislature declare that the public commission board and council and other public agency in this state exist to aid in the conduct of the people s business it be the intent of the law that they action be take openly and that they deliberation be conduct openly the people of this state do not yield they sovereignty to the agency that serve they the people in delegate authority do not give they public servant the right to decide what be good for the people to know and what be not good for they to know the full implementation of these noble word however have take the effort of five session of the legislature since 1953 california have lead the nation in enact guarantee that public business shall be publicly conduct but not until this year do the lawmaker in sacramento plug the remain loophole in the word act despite the lip service pay by local government the anti-secrecy statute have be continuously subvert by reservation and rationalization when all else fail it be argue that open session slow down governmental operation we submit that this be a most desirable effect of the law and one of it principal aim without public scrutiny the deliberation of public agency would no doubt be conduct more speedily but the citizen would of course never be sure that the decision that result be a correct a they be expeditious
