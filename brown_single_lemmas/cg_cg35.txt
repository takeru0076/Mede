the unite state be always ready to participate with the soviet union in serious discussion of these or any other subject that may lead to peace with justice certainly it be not necessary to repeat that the unite state have no intention of interfere in the internal affair of any nation by the same token we reject any soviet attempt to impose it system on we or other people by force or subversion now this concern for the freedom of other people be the intellectual and spiritual cement which have ally we with more than forty other nation in a common defense effort not for a moment do we forget that we own fate be firmly fasten to that of these country we will not act in any way which would jeopardize we solemn commitment to they we and we friend be of course concern with self-defense grow out of this concern be the realization that all people of the free world have a great stake in the progress in freedom of the uncommitted and newly emerge nation these people desperately hope to lift themselves to decent level of live must not by we neglect be force to seek help from and finally become virtual satellite of those who proclaim they hostility to freedom but they must have technical and investment assistance this be a problem to be solve not by america alone but also by every nation cherish the same ideal and in position to provide help in recent year america s partner and friend in western europe and japan have make great economic progress the international economy of 1960 be markedly different from that of the early postwar year no long be the unite state the only major industrial country capable of provide substantial amount of the resource so urgently need in the newly develop country to remain secure and prosperous themselves wealthy nation must extend the kind of co-operation to the less fortunate member that will inspire hope confidence and progress a rich nation can for a time without noticeable damage to itself pursue a course of self-indulgence make it single goal the material ease and comfort of it own citizen thus repudiate it own spiritual and material stake in a peaceful and prosperous society of nation but the enmity it will incur the isolation into which it will descend and the internal moral and spiritual softness that will be engender will in the long term bring it to economic and political disaster america do not become great through softness and self-indulgence she miraculous progress in material achievement flow from other quality far more worthy and substantial adherence to principle and method consonant with we religious philosophy a satisfaction in hard work the readiness to sacrifice for worthwhile cause the courage to meet every challenge the intellectual honesty and capacity to recognize the true path of she own good interest to we and to every nation of the free world rich or poor these quality be necessary today a never before if we be to march together to great security prosperity and peace i believe that the industrial country be ready to participate actively in supplement the effort of the develop nation to achieve progress the immediate need for this kind of co-operation be underscore by the strain in this nation s international balance of payment we surplus from foreign business transaction have in recent year fall substantially short of the expenditure we make abroad to maintain we military establishment overseas to finance private investment and to provide assistance to the less develop nation in 1959 we deficit in balance of payment approach four billion dollar continue deficit of anything like this magnitude would over time impair we own economic growth and check the forward progress of the free world we must meet this situation by promote a rise volume of export and world trade far we must induce all industrialize nation of the free world to work together to help lift the scourge of poverty from less fortunate this co-operation in this matter will provide both for the necessary share of this burden and in bring about still far increase in mutually profitable trade new nation and other struggle with the problem of development will progress only regardless of any outside help if they demonstrate faith in they own destiny and use they own resource to fulfill it moreover progress in a national transformation can be only gradually earn there be no easy and quick way to follow from the oxcart to the jet plane but just a we draw on europe for assistance in we early year so now do these new and emerge nation that do have this faith and determination deserve help respect they need one of the major focal point of we concern be the south-asian region here in two nation alone be almost five hundred million people all work and work hard to raise they standard and in do so to make of themselves a strong bulwark against the spread of an ideology that would destroy liberty i can not express to you the depth of i conviction that in we own and free world interest we must co-operate with other to help these people achieve they legitimate ambition a express in they different multi-year plan through the world bank and other instrumentality a well a through individual action by every nation in position to help we must squarely face this titanic challenge i shall continue to urge the american people in the interest of they own security prosperity and peace to make sure that they own part of this great project be amply and cheerfully support free world decision in this matter may spell the difference between world disaster and world progress in freedom other country some of which i visit last month have similar need a common meet ground be desirable for those nation which be prepare to assist in the development effort during the past year i have discuss this matter with the leader of several western nation because of it wealth of experience the organization for european economic cooperation could help with the initial study need the goal be to enlist all available economic resource in the industrialize free world especially private investment capital by extend this help we hope to make possible the enthusiastic enrollment of these nation under freedom s banner no more startle contrast to a system of sullen satellite could be imagine if we grasp this opportunity to build an age of productive partnership between the less fortunate nation and those that have already achieve a high state of economic advancement we will make bright the outlook for a world order base upon security and freedom otherwise the outlook could be dark indeed we face indeed what may be a turn point in history and we must act decisively and wisely a a nation we can successfully pursue these objective only from a position of broadly base strength no matter how earnest be we quest for guarantee peace we must maintain a high degree of military effectiveness at the same time we be engage in negotiate the issue of arm reduction until tangible and mutually enforceable arm reduction measure be work out we will not weaken the mean of defend we institution america possess an enormous defense power it be i study conviction that no nation will ever risk general war against we unless we should become so foolish a to neglect the defense force we now so powerfully support it be world-wide knowledge that any power which might be tempt today to attack the unite state by surprise even though we might sustain great loss would itself promptly suffer a terrible destruction but i once again assure all people and all nation that the unite state except in defense will never turn loose this destructive power during the past year we long-range strike power unmatched today in man bomber have take on new strength a the atlas intercontinental ballistic missile have enter the operational inventory in fourteen recent test launchings at range of five thousand mile atlas have be strike on an average within two mile of the target this be less than the length of a jet runway well within the circle of destruction incidentally there be an atlas fire last night from all report so far receive it performance conform to the high standard i have just describe such performance be a great tribute to american scientist and engineer who in the past five year have have to telescope time and technology to develop these long-range ballistic missile where america have none before this year moreover grow number of nuclear power submarine will enter we active force some to be arm with polaris missile these remarkable ship and weapon range the ocean will be capable of accurate fire on target virtually anywhere on earth to meet situation of less than general nuclear war we continue to maintain we carrier force we many service unit abroad we always ready army strategic force and marine corps division and the civilian component the continue modernization of these force be a costly but necessary process it be schedule to go forward at a rate which will steadily add to we strength the deployment of a portion of these force beyond we shore on land and sea be persuasive demonstration of we determination to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with we ally for collective security moreover i have direct that step be take to program on a long range basis we military assistance to these ally this be necessary for a sound collective defense system next i refer to we program in space exploration which be often mistakenly suppose to be an integral part of defense research and development we note that first america have already make great contribution in the past two year to the world s fund of knowledge of astrophysics and space science these discovery be of present interest chiefly to the scientific community but they be important foundation stone for more extensive exploration of outer space for the ultimate benefit of all mankind second we military missile program go forward so successfully do not suffer from we present lack of very large rocket engine which be necessary in distant space exploration i be assure by expert that the thrust of we present missile be fully adequate for defense requirement third the unite state be press forward in the development of large rocket engine to place vehicle of many ton into space for exploration purpose fourth in the meantime it be necessary to remember that we have only begin to probe the environment immediately surround the earth use launch system presently available we be develop satellite to scout the world s weather satellite relay station to facilitate and extend communication over the globe for navigation aid to give accurate bearing to ship and aircraft and for perfect instrument to collect and transmit the data we seek fifth we have just complete a year s experience with we new space law i believe it deficient in certain particulars suggest improvement will be submit to the congress shortly the accomplishment of the many task i have allude to require the continuous strengthen of the spiritual intellectual and economic sinew of american life the steady purpose of we society be to assure justice before god for every individual we must be ever alert that freedom do not wither through the careless amass of restrictive control or the lack of courage to deal boldly with the issue of the day a year ago when i meet with you the nation be emerge from an economic downturn even though the sign of resurgent prosperity be not then sufficiently convince to the doubtful today we surge strength be apparent to everyone 1960 promise to be the most prosperous year in we history yet we continue to be afflict by nag disorder among current problem that require solution participate in by citizen a well a government be the need to protect the public interest in situation of prolong labor-management stalemate the persistent refusal to come to grip with a critical problem in one sector of american agriculture the continue threat of inflation together with the persist tendency toward fiscal irresponsibility in certain instance the denial to some of we citizen of equal protection of the law
