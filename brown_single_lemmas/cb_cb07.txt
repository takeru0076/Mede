the un s grave crisis ambassador stevenson yesterday describe the un s problem of elect a temporary successor to the late dag hammarskjold a the grave crisis the institution have face of course it be if the decision go wrong it may be a mr stevenson fear the first step on the slippery path downhill to a un without operational responsibility and without effective mean the integrity of the office not merely require that the secretary general shall be a the charter put it the chief administrative officer of the organization but that neither he nor he staff shall seek or receive instruction from any government or any other authority external to the organization in other word the secretary general be to be a nonpartisan international servant not a political national one he should be a dag hammarskjold certainly be a citizen of the world the charter do stipulate that due regard shall be pay to the importance of recruit the staff on a wide a geographical basis a possible the unite state and it ally have have no objection to this what they have object to be the attempt of the russian to make use of the tragedy of dag hammarskjold s death to turn the entire un staff from the secretary down into political agent of the respective country from which they come the controversy now revolve mainly around the number and geographic origin of the deputy of the secretary general and more particularly around the nature of he relationship with they although the unite state and the ussr have be argue whether there shall be four five or six top assistant the most important element in the situation be not the number of deputy but the manner in which these deputy be to do they work if any one of they have any power to veto the secretary general s decision the nature of the organization will have change if they give he advice when he ask it or if they perform specify duty under he direction the nature of the un will not of necessity change the secretary general must have subject to the constitutional direction of the security council and the general assembly the power to act to propose action and to organize action without be hobble by adviser and assistant act on someone else s instruction this be the root issue for which the unite state should stand we should not become confuse or let we public become confuse over irrelevant question of number or even of geography what we must have if the unite nation be to survive be a nonpolitical nonpartisan an organization at the top a human being can make it subject to no single nation s direction and subservient to no single nation s ambition what the new charter do the new city charter which should get a yes vote a question no 1 on nov 7 would not make a good mayor out of a bad one there be no such magic in man-made law

this in more diplomatic language be what adlai stevenson tell the newspaper man of latin america yesterday on behalf of the unite state government he feel able to end on a note of hope he see evidence of fair wind for the ten-year alliance for progress plan with it emphasis on social reform no group can contribute more to the success of the program than the editor and publisher of the inter-american press association meet in moscow the twenty-second soviet communist party congress open in moscow today in a situation contrast sharply with the script prepare many month ago when this meet be first announce accord to the original program premier khrushchev expect the millions look toward the kremlin this morning to be fill with admiration or rage depend upon individual or national politics because of the bold program for build communism in we time which the congress will adopt but far from be concern about whether or not russia will have achieve utopia by 1980 the world be watch moscow today primarily for clue a to whether or not there will be nuclear armageddon in the immediate future the evident contradiction between the rosy picture of russia s progress paint by the communist party s program and the enormous danger for all humanity pose by premier khrushchev s berlin policy have already lead to speculation abroad that the program may be severely alter whether it be or not the propaganda impact on the free world of the document schedule to be adopt at this meet will be far less than have be originally anticipate and there must be many soviet citizen who know what be go on and who realize that before they can hope to enjoy the full life promise for 1980 they and they child must first survive this congress will see premier khrushchev consolidate he power and lay the groundwork for an orderly succession should death or illness remove he from the scene in the next few year the widespread purge that have take place the past twelve month or so among communist leader in the province give assurance that the party official who will dominate the congress and the central committee it will elect will all have pass the tight possible khrushchev screen both for loyalty to he and for competence and performance on the job dr conant s call to action dr jame b conant have earn a nationwide reputation a a moderate and unemotional school reformer he early report consider the american public school basically sound and not in need of drastic change now a close look at the school in and around the ten large city include new york have shatter this optimism dr conant have come away shock and angry he new book entitle slum and suburb call for fast and drastic action to avert disaster there be room for disagreement concern some of dr conant s specific view he strong opposition to the transfer of negro child to school outside they own neighborhood in the interest of integration will be attack by negro leader who have fight for and achieve this open or permissive enrollment dr conant may underestimate the psychological importance of even token equality he suggestion that the prestige college be make the train institution for medical law and graduate school will run into strong opposition from these college themselves even though what he be recommend be already take shape a a trend but these be side issue to a powerful central theme that theme cut through hypocrisy complacency and double-talk it label the slum especially the negro slum a dead-end street for hundreds of thousands of youngster the villain of the piece be those who deny job opportunity to these youngster and dr conant accuse employer and labor union alike the fact he add be hide from public view by squeamish objection to call bad condition by they right name and by insistence on token integration rather than on real improvement of the school regardless of the color of they student a call for action before it be too late have alarm implication when it come from a man who in he previous report on the school caution so strongly against extreme measure these warning must not be treat lightly dr conant s conscientious selfless effort deserve the nation s gratitude he have serve in position of great glamour both at home and abroad but he may well be do he great service with he straightforward report on the state of the public school and now more junk mail a fascinate letter have just reach this desk from a correspondent who like to receive so-called junk mail he be delight to learn that the post office department be now go to expand this service to deliver mail from representative in congress to they constituent without the use of stamp name address or even zone number in accordance with legislation pass at the last session of congress each representative be authorize to deliver to the post office in bulk newsletter speech and other literature to be drop in every letter box in he district this mean an add burden to innumerable postman who already be complain of heavy load and low pay and it presumably mean an increase postal deficit but we correspondent write think of the additional junk mail each citizen will now be privilege to receive on a regular basis we creditor do not forget we letter write be a die art occasional letter be send by individual to one another and many be write by company to one another but these be mostly typewritten most mail these day consist of nothing that could truly be call a letter
