in a pessimistic assessment of the cold war eden declare there must be much close unity within the west before there can be effective negotiation with the east ordinary method of diplomacy within the free world be inadequate say the former prime minister something much more thorough be require cite the experience of the combine chief of staff in world war 2 eden say that all would have be confusion and disarray without they this he say be exactly what have be happen between the politically free nation in the postwar world we need joint chief of a political general staff cite the advance of communist power in recent year sir anthony observe this very grave state of affair will continue until the free nation accept together the reality of the danger that confront they and unite they policy and resource to meet it while i fully agree with sir anthony s contention i think that we must carry the analysis far bear in mind that while common peril may be the measure of we need the existence or absence of a positive sense of community must be the measure of we capacity while it be hazardous to project the trend of history it seem clear that a genuine community be painfully emerge in the western world particularly among the country of western europe at the end of world war 2 free europe be ready for a new begin the excess of nationalism have bring down upon europe a generation of tyranny and war and a return to the old order of thing seem unthinkable under these condition a new generation of european begin to discover the bond of long association and share value that for so long have be subordinate to nationalist xenophobia a slow and painful trend toward unification have take hold a trend which may at any time be arrest and reverse but which may also lead to a bind federation of europe it may well be that the unification of europe will prove inadequate that the survival of free society will require nothing less than the confederation of the entire western world the movement toward european unity have be express in two current federalism and functionalism one look to the constitution of a unite state of europe the other build on wartime precedent of practical cooperation for the solution of specific problem thus far the advance make have be almost entirely along functional line many factor contribute to the growth of the european movement in 1946 sir winston churchill who have speak often of european union during the war advocate the formation of a kind of unite state of europe have churchill be return to office in 1945 it be just possible that britain instead of stand fearfully aloof would have lead europe toward union in 1947 and 1948 the necessity of massive coordinate effort to achieve economic recovery lead to the formation of the organization for european economic cooperation to supervise and coordinate the use of american aid under the marshall plan the unite state might well have exploit the opportunity provide by the european recovery program to push the hesitant european nation toward political federation a well a economic cooperation but all proposal to this effect be reject by the unite state government at the time another powerful factor in the european movement be the threat of soviet aggression the communist coup in czechoslovakia in 1948 be follow immediately by the conclusion of the brussels treaty a 50-year alliance among britain france and the benelux country and of course the soviet threat be responsible for nato the grand alliance of the atlantic nation new organ of unification proliferate in the decade follow the conclusion of the nato alliance in 1949 the council of europe come into existence a purely consultative parliamentary body but the first organ of political rather than functional unity in 1952 the european coal and steel community be launch place the coal and steel production of france west germany italy and benelux under a supranational high authority for a time it appear that a common european army might be create but the project for a european defense community be reject by the french national assembly in 1954 in 1957 the social-economic approach to european integration be cap by the formation among the six of a tariff-free european common market and euratom for cooperation in the development of atomic energy the overseas democracy have generally encourage the european unification movement without seriously consider the wisdom of they own full participation in a broad atlantic community the unite state and canada belong only to nato and the new oecd britain until recently go along in some area with all of the enthusiasm of the groom at a shotgun wedding in other area it hold back plead it commonwealth bond now britain have decide to seek admission to the european economic community and it seem certain that she will be join by some of she partner in the loose free trade area of the outer seven besides it historical significance a a break with the centuries-old tradition of british insularity britain s move if successful will constitute an historic landmark of the first importance in the movement toward the unification of europe and the western world if a broad atlantic community be to be form and i own judgment be that it lie within the realm of both we need and we capacity a ready nucleus of machinery be at hand in the nato alliance the time be now ripe indeed overdue for the vigorous development of it non-military potentiality for it development a an instrument of atlantic community what be require be the full implementation of article 2 of the treaty which provide the party will contribute toward the far development of peaceful and friendly international relation by strengthen they free institution by bring about a good understand of the principle upon which these institution be found and by promote condition of stability and well-being they will seek to eliminate conflict in they international economic policy and will encourage economic collaboration between any and all of they a lester pearson write in 1955 nato can not live on fear alone it can not become the source of a real atlantic community if it remain organize to deal only with the military threat which first bring it into be the problem of nato be not one of machinery of which there be an abundance but of the will to use it the nato council be available a an executive agency the stand group a a high military authority the unofficial conference of parliamentarian be available a a potential legislative authority this machinery will not become the instrument of an atlantic community by fiat but only when that community evolve from potentiality to reality the existence of a community be a state of mind a conviction that goal and value be widely share that effective communication be possible that mutual trust be reasonably assure an equally promise avenue toward atlantic community may lie through the development and expansion of the oecd conceive a an organ of economic cooperation there be no reason why oecd can not evolve into a broad instrument of union if it member so desire indeed it might be a more appropriate vehicle than nato for the development of a parliamentary organ of the atlantic nation because it could encompass all of the member of the atlantic community include those like sweden and switzerland who be unwilling to be associate with an essentially military alliance like afj underlie these hope and prescription be a conviction that the nation of the north atlantic area do indeed form a community at least a potential community there be nothing new in this what be new and compel be that the west be now but one of several powerful civilization or system and that one or more of the other may pose a mortal danger to the west for century the north atlantic nation dominate the world and a long a they do they could afford the luxury of fight each other that time be now past and the atlantic nation if they be to survive must develop a full-fledged community and they must also look beyond the frontier of western civilization toward a world-wide concert of free nation 6 the burden of these reflection be that a broad unity among the free nation be at the core of we need and if we do not aspire to too much it be also within we capacity a realistic balance of the need for new form of international organization on the one hand and we capacity to achieve they on the other must be approach through the concept of community history have demonstrate many time that concert of nation base solely on the negative spur of common danger be unlikely to survive when the external danger cease to be dramatically urgent only when a concert of nation rest on the positive foundation of share goal and value be it likely to form a viable instrument of long-range policy it follow that the solution to the current disunity of the free nation be only to a very limit extent a matter of devise new machinery of consultation and coordination it be very much a matter of build the foundation of community it be for these reason that proposal for a new world order through radical overhaul of the unite nation or through some sort of world federation be utterly fatuous in a recent book call world peace through world law two distinguish lawyer grenville clark and louis sohn call for just such an overhaul of the un base they case on the world-wide fear of a nuclear holocaust i believe that these proposal however meritorious in term of world need go far beyond we capacity to realize they such proposal look to an apocalyptic act a kind of lockian social contract on a world-wide scale the defect of these proposal be in they attempt to outrun history and they assumption that because something may be desirable it be also possible a work concept of the organic evolution of community must lead we in a different direction the failure of the un and of other international organ suggest that we have already go beyond what be internationally feasible we problem therefore be to devise process more modest in they aspiration adjust to the real world of sovereign nation state and diverse and hostile community the history of the un demonstrate that in a pluralistic world we must develop process of influence and persuasion rather than coercion it be possible that international organization will ultimately supplant the multi-state system but it proper function for the immediate future be to reform and supplement that system in order to render pluralism more compatible with an interdependent world new machinery of coordination should not be we primary objective in the foreseeable future though perhaps the political general staff of western leader propose by sir anthony eden would serve a useful purpose generally however there be an abundance of available machinery of coordination in nato in oecd in the un and elsewhere the trouble with this machinery be that it be not use and the reason that it be not use be the absence of a conscious sense of community among the free nation we proper objective then be the development of a new spirit the realization of a potential community a concert of free nation should take it inspiration from the tradition of the nineteenth century concert of europe with it common value and accept rule of the game constitution of and by themselves mean little the history of both the league of nation and the unite nation demonstrate that but a powerful sense of community even with little or no machinery mean a great deal that be the lesson of the nineteenth century a realistic concert of free nation might be expect to consist of an inner community of the north atlantic nation and an outer community embrace much or all of the non-communist world
