the fall of rome the discovery of precious metal and the protestant reformation be all link and could only be explain and understand by comprehend the link that precede and those that follow often the historian must consider the use of intuition or instinct by those individual or nation which he be study unconsciously government or race or institution may enter into some undertake without fully realize why they be do so they react in obedience to an instinct or urge which have itself be impel by natural law a court may strike down a law on the basis of an intuitive feel that the law be inimical to the numerical majority a nation may go to war on some trifle pretext when in reality it may have be guide by an unconscious instinct that it very life be at stake when the historian encounter a situation in which he can perceive no visible cause and effect sequence he should be alert to intuition and unconscious instinct a possible guide adam firmly contend that the historian must never underrate the impact of the geographical environment on history here be another indispensable tool indeed he conclude that geographical condition have exercise a great possibly a preponderating influence over man s destiny the failure of greece to reach the imperial destiny that periclean athens have seem to promise be almost directly attributable to she physical conformation all area of history be either favorably or adversely affect by the geographical environment and no respectable historian could pursue the study of history without a thorough knowledge of geography brook adam be consistent in he admonishment to historian about the necessary tool or insight they need to possess however a a practice historian he himself have leave few clue to the amount of professional scholarship that he use when write history in fact if judgment be to be render upon the soundness of he historicism they must be base on scanty evidence what evidence be available would seem to indicate that brook unlike he old brother henry have most of the methodological vice usually find in the amateur a credulousness a distaste for documentation an uncritical reliance on contemporary account and a proneness to assume a theory a true before adequate proof be provide be all evidence of he failure to comprehend the use of the scientific method or to evaluate the responsibility of the historian to he read public this be not to assume that he work be without merit but the validity of he assumption concern the mean of history must always be consider against this background of an unprofessional approach he credulity be perhaps good illustrate in he introduction to the emancipation of massachusetts which purport to examine the trial of moses and to draw a parallel between the leader of the israelite exodus from egypt and the leadership of the puritan clergy in colonial new england much criticism have be leveled at this rather force analogy but what be equally significant be adam complete acceptance of the biblical record a good and trustworthy history in light of the scholarly reappraisal engender by the high criticism this be a most remarkable statement particularly come from one who be well know for he antifundamentalist view the desire to substantiate a thesis at the expense of sound research technique smack more of the propagandist than the historian a similar amateurish characteristic be reveal in adam failure to check the accuracy and authenticity of he informational source if he find data that fit he general plan he use it and count he source trustworthy conversely if statistics be uncover which contradict a cherish theory the source be denounce a faulty such manipulation be frequently encounter in he essay on the suppression of the monastery during the english reformation adam depend largely on the dispatch of foreign ambassador and observer in england claim that the report of such agent have to be accurate because there be no newspaper this be certainly an irrational dogmatism in which the modern mind attempt to understand the spirit of the sixteenth century on twentieth-century term moreover he reject the contemporary account of englishman casually adjudge they to be distort by prejudice because the opinion of englishman be of no great value what be exposited by this observation be not the inherent prejudice of englishman but the anglophobia of brook adam in all fairness it must be admit that adam make no pretense at be an impartial historian impartiality to he mean an unwillingness to generalize and to search for a synthesis he deplore the impact of german historiography on the write of history term it a dismal monster ranke and he disciple have reduce history to a profession of dullness brook adam prefer the chronicle of froissart or the style and theorizing of edward gibbon for at least they take a stand on the issue about which they write he write eloquently to william jame that impartial history be not only impossible but undesirable if the historian be convince of he own correctness then he should not allow he vision to become fog by disturb fact it be history that must be in error not the historian it be this basic trait that separate adam from the rank of professional historian and lead he to commit time and time again what be he most serious offense against the historical method namely the tendency to assume the truth of an hypothesis before submit it to the test of fact all of adam work reflect this dogmatic characteristic no page seem to be complete without the statement of at least one unproved generalization one example of this be he assertion that all servile revolt must be deal with by physical force there be no explanation of term nor a qualification that most such revolt have be deal with by force only a bald dogmatism that they must because of some undefined compulsion be so repel on matter of race he be similarly inflexible most of the modern latin race seem to have inherit the rigidity of the roman mind he cite the french revolution a typify this rigidity but make no mention of the italian who have be able to adapt to all type of circumstance he pontificate that one of the first sign of advance civilization be the fall in the value of woman in man s eye it make no difference that most evidence point to an opposite conclusion for adam have make up he mind before all the fact be available all critic of adam and he method have observe this particular deficiency jt shotwell be appal by such spurious history a that which attribute the fall of the carolingian empire to the woolen trade and he urge adam to transform he essay into a real history embody not merely those fact which fit into he theory but also the modification and exception be wergeland call the adam method literally antihistorical while clive day maintain that the assumption be not confine to theory alone but be also applicable to straight factual evidence moreover state day he always omit fact which tend to disprove he hypothesis even d wasson who compare the emancipation of massachusetts to the lift of a fog from ancient landscape be also force to admit the methodological deficiency of the author in summary brook adam feel that the nature of history be order and that the order so discover be a much subject to historical law a the force of nature moreover he believe that most professional historian lack some of the essential instrument for a proper study of history however despite the insight of many of he observation he own conclusion be open to suspicion because of he failure to employ at all time the correct research method this should not prejudice an evaluation of he finding but they be not the finding of a completely impartial investigator what be perhaps more important than he concept of the nature of history and the historical method be those force which shape the direction of he think in the final analysis he contribution to american historiography be found on almost intuitive insight into religion economics and darwinism the three factor which condition he search for a law of history religion without supernaturalism brook adam consider religion a an extremely significant manifestation of man s fear of the unknown but it be nothing more than that religion and the church be institution which have be create by man not god he do not deny god he simply do not believe that a creator intervene or interfere in human affair the historian need not be concern with the philosophical problem suggest by religion there be no evidence either of a positive or negative type of the action of a divine be in this world and since the historian should only be interest in strictly terrestrial activity he research should eliminate the supernatural furthermore he must regard religion a the expression of human force certainly he must recognize it power and attempt to ascertain it influence on the flow of history but he must not confuse the natural and the mundane with the divine adam be not break new ground when he claim that the worship of an unseen power be in reality a reflection of man s inability to cope with he environment student of anthropology and comparative religion have long be aware that there be indeed a direct connection but adam be one of the first to suggest that this human incompetence be the only motivate factor behind religion it be this fear which explain the development of a priestly caste whose function in society be to mollify and appease the angry deity to keep themselves entrench in power the priest be force to demonstrate they unique status through the miracle it be the use of the supernatural that keep they in business the german barbarian of the fourth century offer an excellent example the german in the fourth century be a very simple race who comprehend little of natural law and who therefore refer phenomenon they do not understand to supernatural intervention this intervention could only be control by priest and thus the invasion cause a rapid rise in the influence of the sacred class the power of every ecclesiastical organization have always rest on the miracle and the clergy have always prove they divine commission a do elijah adam contend that once such a special class have be create it become a vest interest and seek to maintain itself by assume exclusive control over the relationship between god and man thus the church be bear and because of it intrinsic character be soon identify a a conservative institution determine to resist the force of change to identify itself with the political ruler and to maintain a kind of splendid isolation from the mass doctrine be not only mysterious it be also sacred and no believer in an inspire church could tolerate have she canon examine a we should examine human law these basic idea concern the nature of religion be adam believe some of the major key to the understand of history and the movement of society the dark view about the puritan find in the emancipation of massachusetts be never alter despite they adherence to the status quo the force of organize religion be compel to make adjustment a increase civilization augment human knowledge in the law of civilization and decay brook adam trace this evolution always point to the fact that although the form become more rational the substance remain unchanged the relic worship and monasticism of the middle age be more advance form than be primitive fetish worship and nature myth yet the idea imbed in each be identical to surround the unknown with mystery and to isolate that class which have be give special dominion over the secret of god to adam that age in which religion exercise power over the entire culture of the race be one of imagination and it be largely the admiration he so obviously hold for such era that betray a peculiar religiosity a sentiment he would have probably deny
