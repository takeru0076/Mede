always have a good orchestra i like to dance she say then turn and walk away there have nt be anything really personal in she interest in i i know that it be just that she feel deeply about every patient on the ward and want to believe that they might benefit from they treatment there now ride this hospital bus feel isolate and utterly alone i know that she be genuine and unique quite unlike any girl i have know before it seem the most important thing in i life at this moment that she should know the real truth about i it be a fantastic story only two people in the state of illinois know that i be enter hanover state hospital under an assume name or why it be unlikely that any girl a sharp a mary jane brennan would believe it without proof but i have the proof all document in a legal agreement which i would show she the moment i be free to do so a the bus turn into the main highway and head toward hanover i settle back in i seat and close i eye think over the event of the past two week try to put the piece in order i wonder suddenly a i listen to the disconnect jabberings come from the patient behind i if i have not perhaps imagine it all perhaps this be reality and dale nelson the actor be delusion a figment of carl anderson s imagination four i have come to chicago from new york early in september with a dramatic production call ask tony it be a bad play real grade-a turkey which only a prevalence of angel with grandiose dream of capital gain and tax money to burn could have put into rehearsal no one not even the producer have any real hope of get it back to broadway but because it be a suspense gangster story of the capone era many of we feel that it might catch on for a run in chicago continue a a road company and eventually become a movie such optimism be completely unjustified the critic literally scream they indignation ask tony be doom from the moment kupcinet leveled on it in he sun-times column we open on friday and close the follow monday out of the entire cast i alone receive good notice for i portrayal of a psychopathic killer this let i in for a lot of kid from the rest of the company two member of which be native chicagoan we be pay off tuesday morning and give ticket back to new york i feel lonely and depress a i pack i bag at the croydon hotel it seem to i that i life be destined to be one brilliant failure after another i have be among the top third in i class at nyu have want desperately to go to medical school but i d run out of money and energy at the same time then late i have quit i safe secure five-a-week spot on a network soap opera to take a part in this play it seem to i that i be not only unlucky but quite stupid a well i know that i d soon be back work a an orderly at the hospital or a a counterman at union news or schraffts while wait for another act job to open it suddenly occur to i that i do not particularly like act that i be at some sort of crossroads and would have to decide soon what i be go to do with i life i close the last bag and stand all three at the door for the bellboy to pick up then go to the bathroom for a drink of water the telephone ring when i answer it a voice too dignified and british to be real say be this mr dale nelson the actor all right i say why do nt you bastard lie off for a while i beg you pardon sir all right this be dale nelson the actor good i m call you mr nelson at the request of mr phillip wycoff could you possibly have lunch with he today he car could pick you up at you hotel at twelve i smile you ll send the rolls-royce of course yes of course mr nelson i start to say something else appropriate but the man have hang up i finally go downstairs to the bar off the main lobby where most of the cast be drown they sorrow over the untimely pass of ask tony they all bow low a i approach they all right you bastard i say the great actor be about to buy a drink i lay a tenspot on the bar and motion to the bartender to serve a round he have just return i change when the doorman come in off the street to page i i walk over to he you mr nelson he ask that s right mr wycoff s car be wait for you at the east entrance i follow he out through the

open the door of the town car
