for crucial encounter one of the initial question put to president kennedy at he first news conference last january be about he attitude toward a meet with premier khrushchev mr kennedy reply i m hopeful that from more traditional exchange we can perhaps find great common ground the president know that a confrontation with mr khrushchev sooner or late probably be inevitable and even desirable but he be convince that the reality of power military economic and ideological be the decisive factor in the struggle with the communist and that these could not be talk away at a head of government meet he want to buy time to strengthen the we and it ally and to define and begin to implement he foreign policy last friday the white house announce president kennedy will meet with soviet premier nikita s khrushchev in vienna june 3 and 4 the announcement come after a period of sharp deterioration in east-west relation the heighten tension in fact have be a major factor in the president s change of view about the urgency of a meet with the soviet leader he be not go to vienna to negotiate the simultaneous announcement in washington and moscow last week stress that no formal negotiation be plan but mr kennedy have become convince that a personal confrontation with mr khrushchev might be the only way to prevent catastrophe that objective set the high stake and drama of the vienna meet despite effort by washington last week to play down the significance of the meet it clearly be go to be one of the crucial encounter of the cold war road to vienna the we and soviet head of government have meet three time since sir winston churchill in 1953 introduce a new word into international diplomacy with he call for a fresh approach to the problem of peace at the summit of the nation the first time be in 1955 when a full-dress big four summit meet produce the spirit of geneva the spirit serve chiefly to lull the west while moscow make inroad into the middle east in 1959 president eisenhower and premier khrushchev hold an informal session in the u s that meet produce the spirit of camp david a spirit it late turn out that mask a basic misunderstanding about progress toward a berlin settlement on the third occasion another big four summit session at paris a year ago there be no problem of an illusory spirit premier khrushchev wreck the conference at it initial session with a bitter denunciation of the we for the u-2 incident the episode tend to confirm the we belief that propaganda the hope of one-sided concession and the chance to split the ally rather than genuine negotiation be the soviet leader s real aim in summitry pre-inaugural position thus when premier khrushchev intimate even before inauguration that he hope for an early meet with the new president mr kennedy be confront with a delicate problem shortly before he nomination he have set forth he basic view about the problem of negotiation with the soviet leader in these word a long a mr khrushchev be convince that the balance of world power be shift he way no amount of either smile or toughness neither camp david talk nor kitchen debate can compel he to enter fruitful negotiation the president have set for himself the task which he believe vital of awaken the we and it ally to the hard and complex effort necessary to shift that balance he do not want the effort weaken by any illusion that summit magic might make it unnecessary he want time too to review the unite state global commitment and to test both the policy he have inherit and new one he be formulate above all he do not want to appear to be run hat in hand to premier khrushchev s doorstep attitude flexible at the same time the president take pain not to rule out an eventual meet with the soviet leader ideally he know it should be precede by concrete progress at low level but mr kennedy see value even in an informal meet provide that undue hope be not raise in connection with it it would give he an opportunity to take the measure of he chief adversary in the cold war to try to probe mr khrushchev s intention and to make clear he own view moreover an eventual meet be desirable if for no other reason than to satisfy world opinion that the we be not inflexible and be spare no effort to ease international tension both element the caution about a meet the willingness eventually to hold one be reflect in a letter from the president which ambassador llewellyn e thompson bring back to russia late in february the letter date feb 22 be deliver to premier khrushchev in novosibirsk siberia on march 9 it deal mainly with a broad range of east-west issue but it also briefly suggest the possibility of a meet with mr khrushchev before the end of the year if the international climate be favorable and schedule permit development over the next two month however cause the president to reconsider the question of the time there be intense discussion in the inner council of the white house about the advisability of an early meet not because the international climate be improve but precisely because it be deteriorate alarmingly deadlock on test the president be especially concern about the deadlock in the nuclear test ban negotiation at geneva the deadlock have be cause by the russian new demand for a three-man east west and neutral directorate and thus a veto over the control machinery in the we strong pressure have be build up for a resumption of test on ground that the russian may be secretly test mr kennedy be less trouble by that possibility than by the belief that a geneva breakdown or even continue stalemate would mean an unchecked spread of nuclear weapon to other country a well a a fatal blow to any hope for disarmament there be reason to believe that premier khrushchev be also concern about a possible spread of nuclear weapon particularly to communist china the question arise a to whether a frank discussion of that danger with the soviet leader have not become urgent moreover moscow appear determine to apply the tripartite veto principle to the executive organ of all international body include the un secretariat and the international control commission for laos mr kennedy be convince that insistence on the demand would make international agreement or even negotiation impossible development in cuba and laos also suggest the advisability of an early summit meet initially the white house reaction be that the bitter exchange with moscow over cuba and the conflict in laos have dampen prospect for a meet at the same time there be increase reason for a quick meet lest the soviet leader a a result of those episode come to a dangerously erroneous conclusion about the west s ability and determination to resist communist pressure in cuba the we have blunder badly and create the impression of impotency against communist penetration even on it own doorstep in laos the picture be almost equally bad we willingness to accept a neutral laos may have lead premier khrushchev to believe that other area could be neutralize on soviet term beyond that ally disagreement about military intervention in laos despite warning that they might do so allow moscow to carry out with impunity a series of military and diplomatic move that greatly strengthen the pro-communist force a a result the west be in a poor bargain position at the current geneva negotiation on laos and south vietnam and other nation in southeast asia be under increase pressure in the light of those event there appear to be a real danger that premier khrushchev might overreach himself ambassador thompson report from moscow that the soviet leader s mood be cocky and aggressive he have indicate that he plan new move on berlin before the year be out the president and he adviser feel that the time might have come to warn premier khrushchev against a grave miscalculation in area such a berlin iran or latin america from which there would be no turn back it be in the midst of such white house deliberation that premier khrushchev on may 4 make new inquiry through the we embassy in moscow about a meet with the president in the near future mr kennedy tell moscow he would give he answer by may 20 after consultation with the ally the response from london paris and bonn be favorable firm arrangement for the meet in vienna be work out in a final exchange between moscow and washington last week apparently at the insistence of the we the simultaneous announcement issue in washington and moscow last friday emphasize the informal nature of the meet the washington announcement say the president and chairman khrushchev understand that this meet be not for the purpose of negotiate or reach agreement on the major international problem that involve the interest of many other country the meet will however afford a timely and convenient opportunity for the first personal contact between they and a general exchange of view on the major issue which affect the relationship between the two country the outlook the vienna meet will bring together a season 67-year-old veteran of the cold war who in mr kennedy s own word be shrewd tough vigorous well-informed and confident and a 44-year-old president he birthday be may 29 with a demonstrate capacity for political battle but little experience in international diplomacy the announcement last week of the forthcoming encounter produce strong reaction in the we of both approval and disapproval the approval do not arise from an expectation of far-reaching agreement at vienna the inclination be to accept the statement that there would be no formal negotiation but those who be in favor of the meet feel that a frank exchange between the two man and an opportunity to size one another up would prove salutary mr khrushchev be know to rely heavily on he instinct about he adversary and to be a shrewd judge of man the feel be that he would sense an inner core of toughness and determination in the president and that plain talk by mr kennedy would give he pause apart from the personal equation another reason advance in favor of the meet be that too often in the past the we appear to have be drag reluctantly to the summit premier khrushchev have make propaganda capital out of that fact and in the end get he summit meet anyway this time the initiative come in part at least from washington other ally consult there be also the fact that by the time he meet mr khrushchev the president will have complete conversation with all the other principal ally leader thus he will be in a position to disabuse the soviet leader of any notion he may have about grave ally disunity finally there be a wide area of agreement on the value of the president s make a final effort in the summit spotlight for a nuclear test accord there be no single issue that have arouse strong feeling throughout the world if test be to be resume the argument go it be vital that the we make plain that the onus belong to the soviet union disapproval of the meet be base largely on the belief that the time could hardly be bad after cuba and laos it be argue mr khrushchev will interpret the president s consent to the meet a far evidence of western weakness perhaps even panic and be certain to try to exploit the advantage he now believe he hold moreover the president be meet the soviet leader at a time when the administration have still not decide on the scope of america s firm foreign policy commitment the question be raise for example a to what attitude the president would take if mr khrushchev propose a broad neutral belt extend from southeast asia to the middle east
