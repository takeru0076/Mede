seem to realize if they be nt tie up with the thing a i be be that 90 % of the problem be transportation i never dream of the logistical difficulty involve until at long last both of i boy get squeeze into high school it seem like only last year that we watch they set out up the hill hand in hand on a rainy day in they yellow raincoat to finger-paint at the grammar school get to and from school be no problem they either walk or be drive now they go to a high school that be two mile away one might think the problem would be similar they could walk ride on a bus or be drive it s much more complex than that generally they go to school with a girl name gloriana who life down the block and have a car this be a way of get to school but i understand it entail a certain loss of social status a young man do nt like to be drive up in front of a school in a car drive by a girl who be nt even in a high class than he be and be also a girl why do nt you walk to school then i suggest i father walk through two mile of snow in illinois do you i be ask no i say i do nt happen to grow up in illinois i explain however that i have i share of hardship in make i daily pilgrimage to the foot of wisdom i have to ride a streetcar two mile sometimes the streetcar be late sometimes there be nt even any seat i have to stand up with the lady sometimes i get on the wrong car and do nt get to school at all but wind up at the ocean or some other dismal place and have to spend the day there i ve try to compromise by let they take the little car now and then when they do that i wife have to drive i to work in the big car she have to have at least one car herself i feel a certain loss of status when i be drive up in front of work in a car drive by i wife who be only a woman even that be nt satisfactory if they have to take any car they d rather take the big one they say that when they take a car gloriana do nt take she car but ride with they but when gloriana ride with they they also have to take the two girl who usually ride with she so the little car be nt big enough the logic of that be impeccable of course except that i feel like a fool be drive up to work in a little car by i wife when everybody know i have a big car and be capable of drive myself the solution naturally be the bus however it s a half-mile walk down a steep hill from we house to the bus and it s too hard on i leg i wife could drive we down the hill and we could all walk from there but that s hardly realistic nobody walk anymore but crackpot and harry truman and he s already get an education advance publicity on

an idea for a child s room that be easy to execute and be completely charm use puppet for lamp base most child love the animate puppet face and they flexible body and they prefer to see they a though the puppet be in action rather than put away in box display a lamp the puppet delight the child and be decorative accent to create such a lamp order a wire pedestal from any lamp shop measure the puppet to determine the height of the light socket allow three to four inch above the puppet s head make sure that the metal tube through which the wire pass be in the shape of an invert l the foot of the l about three inch long so that the puppet can hang directly under the light pull string use the string that manipulate the puppet suspend he from the light fixture by tie the string to the lamp base in this way you can arrange he leg and arm in any desire position with foot or one foot barely rest on the pedestal if the puppet be of uniform size you can change they in accord with you child s whim although a straight drum shade would be adequate and sufficiently neutral that the puppet could be change without disharmony it be far more fun to create shade in the gay spirit of a child s playtime those illustrate be reminiscent of a circus top or a merry-go-round the scalloped edge be particularly appeal today s trend toward furniture design from america s past be teach home-owner and decorator a renew respect for the shrewd cabinetmaker of we colonial era a generation ago there be plenty of people who appreciate antique and fine reproduction in the background lurk the feel however that these piece beautiful a they be lack the utilitarian touch so junior s bedroom be usually trick out with heavy nondescript piece that supposedly could take the hard knock while the fine secretary be relegate to the parlor where it be for show only this be nt true of the many homemaker of the 1960 s accord to decorator consultant leland alden housewife be find literally hundreds of way of get the maximum use out of traditional design say mr alden and they be do it largely because colonial craftsman have an innate sense of the practical solid investment there be a number of reason why the eighteenth century designer have to develop down to earth design or go out of business
