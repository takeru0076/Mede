9 martin and stendler present evidence that infant and young child can and do solve many problem at a relatively simple perceptual level simply by combine object and count they after they have develop concept they be free from the necessity of manipulate object they do symbolically what they once have to do concretely the ability to think seem to increase consistently with age one experiment show the great one-year difference occur between the eleventh and twelfth year 10 many study indicate that elementary-school child s interest cover the whole field of science that they question indicate a genuine interest in social process and event and that a they mature they interest and capability change and broaden emotional characteristic how a child feel about himself about other people and about the task confront he in school may have a much influence on he success in school a he physical and intellectual characteristic a considerable amount of evidence exist to show that an unhappy and insecure child be not likely to do well in school subject emotional maturity be the result of many factor the principal one be the experience of the first few year of the child s life however the teacher who understand the influence of emotion on behavior may be highly influential in help pupil gain confidence security and satisfaction concern this responsibility of the teacher suggestion for help child gain good control of the emotion be present in chapter 11 the follow generalization about the emotional characteristic of elementary-school child may be helpful 1 typically the young child s emotional reaction last for a relatively short time a contrast to those of an adult 2 a the child grow old he emotional reaction lead to mood or emotional state draw out over a period of time and express slowly rather than in short abrupt outburst 3 study of the growth and decline of child s fear indicate that fear due to strange object noise fall and unexpect movement decline during the preschool year but that fear of the dark of be alone and of imaginary creature or robber increase 4 ridicule a child for be afraid or force he to meet the fear situation alone be poor way of deal with the problem more effective solution include explanation the example of another child or condition by associate the fear object place or person with something pleasant 5 child need help in learn to control they emotion the young child learn from parent and teacher that temper tantrum scream kick and hit will not get he what he want the old child learn that intense emotional outburst will not win approval by he peer and therefore make a real effort to control he emotion 6 child differ widely in they emotional response among infant the pattern of emotional response be similar a the influence of learn and environment be feel emotional behavior become individualize social characteristic although no national norm exist for the social development of child the teacher can find a great deal of information concern type of social behavior normally display by child at various age level the follow summary will give the student some idea about the social characteristic of elementary-school child the student will certainly want to explore more deeply into the fascinate study of immature individual struggle to meet they developmental need and at the same time try to learn the rule of the game in the ever-expanding number of group in which they hold membership 1 during early childhood child be more interest in the approval of they parent and teacher than they be in the approval of other child after they have be in school a few year they interest in playmate of they own age increase and they interest in adult decrease the child who have once consider it a treat to accompany he parent on picnic and family gathering now consider it a bear in late childhood the influence of the group on the social behavior of the child continue to increase the group set the style in clothing the kind of play engage in and the ideal of right and wrong behavior 2 in early childhood the choice of a companion be likely to be for another child of he own age or a year or two old who can do the thing he like to do such factor a sex intelligence and status in the group do not influence he choice much at this time 3 in late childhood an interest in team game replace individual play loyalty to the group a feel of superiority over those who be not member and unwillingness to play with member of the opposite sex become dominant trait 4 during early childhood boy tease and bully on the average more than girl those who feel inferior or insecure engage in these activity more than do well-adjusted child 5 during late childhood boy like to tease jostle and talk smart to girl girl who be more mature than boy frown upon the youthful antic of boy of they own age 6 by the time pupil reach the sixth grade they ethical and moral standard be fairly well develop they exhibit a keen interest in social political and economic problem but they frequently have vague and incorrect notion about the term they use rather glibly in they routine school work 7 between the age of two and four year negativism or resistance to adult authority be noticeable after the fourth year it begin to decline however a we have see in late childhood the child begin to substitute the standard of the peer group for those of parent and teacher 8 the elementary-school child grow gradually in he ability to work in group the child in the primary grade can play harmoniously with one companion but he desire to be first in everything get he into trouble when the group get large he want to be with people but he have nt yet learn to cooperate in the middle grade however he begin to participate more effectively in group activity such a select a leader help to make plan and carry on group activity and set up rule govern the enterprise why the teacher should study the individual pupil much progress have be make in the last two decade in develop technique for understand child yet in almost any classroom today can be find child whose need be not be meet by the school program some be fail to achieve a much a they ability would permit other never seem able to enter fully into the life of the classroom these child have be describe a those who be try to say something to adult who do not understand many school system now employ school psychologist and child guidance specialist these specialist perform valuable service by help teacher learn to identify child who need special attention by suggest way of meet the need of individual child in the regular classroom and by provide clinical service for severely maladjusted child it be the classroom teacher however who have daily contact with pupil and who be in a unique position to put sound psychological principle into practice indeed a study of the individual child be an integral part of the work of the elementary-school teacher rather than merely an additional chore teacher and administrator in many elementary school have assume that divide the pupil in any grade into group on the basis of test score solve the problem of meet the need of individual what they should recognize be that child who have be place in one of these group on a narrow academic basis still differ widely in attribute that influence success and that they still must be treat a individual although the teacher must be concern with maintain standard he must also be concern about understand difference in ability background and experience factor that inhibit learn and lead to maladjustment study conduct in various section of the unite state indicate that many child in elementary school be maladjusted emotionally and that many of they be fail to make satisfactory progress in school subject one study which involve 1524 pupil in grade one to six find that 12 percent of the pupil be seriously maladjusted and that 23 percent be read a year below capacity it be apparent therefore that the teacher need to know what factor have a vital bear on the learn and adjustment of child when a child fail to meet the standard of the school in he rate of learn insecurity unhappiness and other form of maladjustment frequently follow these maladjustment in turn inhibit learn and a vicious cycle be complete it be easy for the teacher to rationalize that the child who be not achieve in accordance with he know ability be just plain lazy or that the child who lack interest in school who dislike the teacher or who be overaggressive be a hopeless delinquent the cause of retardation and maladjustment may be find in physical factor such a defective speech or hear impair vision faulty motor coordination a frail constitution chronic disease malnutrition and glandular malfunction they may be cause by poor health habit such a faulty eat and sleep habit they may be relate to mental immaturity or lack of aptitude for certain type of school work the curriculum may be too difficult for some and too easy for other teach method learn material and promotion policy may inhibit learn and lead to maladjustment for some child unwholesome family relation break home and undesirable community influence may also be contribute factor this be only a minimum list of the factor that inhibit learn and contribute to maladjustment among child moreover these condition do not influence all child in the same manner a vision handicap that may produce nervous tension and read disability for one child may spur another child on to even great achievement in read an impoverished home that may discourage one child may constitute the motivation cause another to work hard for successful achievement in school at any rate the teacher who recognize common cause of retardation and maladjustment can frequently do a great deal to eliminate the cause of pupil discouragement failure and maladjustment source of information about child successful teach involve get enough information about each pupil to understand why he behave a he do in certain situation and how he achievement in school be be influence by various factor in he environment the classroom teacher can not be expect to be a proficient in the use of the technique of child study a the clinical psychologist he can not be expect to administer all the test and gather all the information need about each child in he classroom he can be expect however to examine and interpret the information already available to refine and extend he own technique for study individual child and to utilize opportunity arise in connection with regular classroom activity for gain a good understand of he pupil this section deal with some of the source of information that can be tap by the classroom teacher chapter 15 provide more detail information about specific technique use in evaluate pupil progress cumulative record most school system today maintain a system of cumulative record of pupil these record when systematically maintain provide much information about the child which the teacher can use in guidance instruction group and report to parent each teacher have in he classroom a metal file equip with a lock which be use to store cumulative record folder during summer vacation period these record be store in the office of the principal only the teacher and other professional personnel be permit to see or use these record each new teacher to whom the pupil go be expect to study the information in the cumulative record and to bring it up to date some school system provide write instruction to principal and teacher designate when certain information be to be record on cumulative record form and explain how the information be to be summarize and use
