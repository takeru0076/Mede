test new sell distribution and promotion technique to gain a big competitive edge give this kind of business climate what competitive marketing problem will you company face in the next 10 yr base on we experience with client we see 14 major problem which fall into three broad group the market place itself marketing method and marketing management 1 problem in the market great price-consciousness there have be an intensification of price-consciousness in recent year there be every indication it will continue frequently wittingly or unwittingly price-consciousness have be foster by manufacturer distributor and dealer despite generally good level of income we see great price pressure than ever before travel back along the chain from consumer to distributor to manufacturer here be some key area to examine to make sure you price strategy will be on target have the probable price situation in you field be forecast a a basis for future plan have cost study be make of every phase of you operation to determine what might be do if thing get bad have you actually check out not just mentally test different sell approach design to counter the price competition problem increase customer sophistication average consumer be become more sophisticate regard product and advertise claim partly because of widespread criticism of such assertion this problem can force a change in marketing approach in many kind of business have you examine this problem of increase consumer sophistication from the standpoint of you own company great demand for service need for service be here to stay and the problem be go to be tough to solve in the sixties there be two reason for this first most product tend to become more complex second in a competitive market the customer feel he weight and throw it around provide good customer service require a thorough a marketing and general management plan job a the original sell of the product too often it be think of at the last moment of new product introduction good service start with product design and plan many product seem to be design for a production economy not for a service one proper follow-through require train you own sales organization and you distributor organization not only in the technique but also in good customer relation have you assess the importance of service and give it proper attention wide discretionary choice for customer in spend he money today the consumer be pull in many direction to the manufacturer of the more convenient-type product the purchase of which can be switch delay or put off entirely the implication be important you competition be now proportionately great you be compete not only against manufacturer in the same field but also against a vast array of manufacturer of other appeal consumer product many industry trade association be develop campaign to protect or enhance the share of the consumer s dollar be spend on they particular product have you company think through it strategy in this whole discretionary buy area geographic shift of customer the trend have be in evidence for many year population shift to the southwest and far west and from city to suburb these shift will continue in the next 10 yr have you consider the implication of continue geographic shift in term of sales force allocation strength of distributor organization and even plant location market concentration and distribution in fewer account we have already witness great change through merger and acquisition in the food industry at both the manufacture and retail end instead of relatively small sales to many account there be now large sales to or through fewer account the change may require different product price package warehousing salesmanship advertise and executive attention practically every link in the marketing network may have to be adjust have you examine these trend forecast the effect and plan you marketing strategy to compete effectively under change circumstance 2 problem in marketing method more private label competition in the area of private label competition it be logical to expect a continuation of trend which have be under way during the first decade a mass dealer and distributor organization grow in size there be every reason to expect they to try to share in the manufacturer s a well a the distributor s profit which be in effect what the sale of private brand tend to do average manufacturer frequently have help build private brand business deliver largely the same quality and style in private brand merchandise a in brand moreover the large and more aggressive mass distribution outlet and chain store have insist on high quality and the customer seem to have catch on if you be up against private brand competition have you formulate a long-term program for research and strengthen you market position if private brand competition have nt be feel in you product field a yet have you think how you will cope with it if and when it do appear less personal salesmanship display merchandise back by pre-selling through advertise and promotion will continue to make stride in the sixties it have multiple implication and possible headache for you marketing program how can you cash in on this fast-growing type of outlet and still maintain relationship with old exist outlet which be still important if you have a higher-quality product how can you make it stand out justify it premium price without the speak word salesmanship be still necessary but it s a different brand of salesmanship have you carefully examine the sell technique which good suit you product have you study the caliber and sales approach of you sales force in relation to requirement for effective marketing be you experiment with different sell slant in develop new customer high cost of distribution generally some distribution cost be keep up by competitive pressure some by the fact that the customer have come to expect certain nicety and flourish no manufacturer have take the initiative in point out the cost involve the use of bulk handle be continuously grow computer be be use to keep branch inventory at more workable level selective sell concentrate sales on the large account have be use effectively by some manufacturer there may be possible economy at any one of a number of link in you marketing and distribution chain do you have a program for scrutinize all these link regularly and carefully and with some imagination in you sales force will a small number of higher-priced high-quality salesman serve you good or can you make out good with a large number of lower-paid salesman will you trade customer settle for less attention and fewer frill in return for some benefit they can share in one company cover the country with a high-quality sales force of 10 man the president personally phone each major account every 6 mo a a result distribution cost be cut customer relation improve distribution cost be almost bind to increase in the sixties and you will never know what you can do to control they unless you study each element and experiment with alternative way of do the job high cost of advertise and promotion from the manufacturer s point of view the increase cost of advertise and promotion be a very real problem to be face in the sixties it be accentuate by the need for pre-selling goods and private label competition how much fundamental think and research have you company do on it advertise program be you follow competition willy-nilly try to match dollar for dollar or be you experiment with new mean for reach and influence consumer have you evaluate the proper place of advertise and all phase of promotion in you total marketing program from the standpoint of effort money and effectiveness increase tempo of new product development practically all forecast mention new and exciting product on the horizon will you be out in the market place with some of these sales-building new product if competition beat you to it this exciting new product era can have real headache in store on the other hand the process of obsoleting an old product and introduce the new one be usually mighty expensive a market become large and marketing more complex the cost of an error become progressively large be you r & d or product development program tune in to the commercial reality of the market be there regular communication from the field or meeting of sales and marketing personnel with r & d people technical knowledge be a wonderful thing but it s useless unless it eventually feed the cash register be there individual in you organization who can shepherd a new product through to commercialization who can develop reliable estimate of sales volume production and distribution cost and translate the whole into profit and loss and balance sheet figure which management can act on with some assurance we have see good new product shelve because no one have the assignment to develop such fact and plan and management could nt make up it mind 3 problem in marketing management shortage of skilled salesman there be a shortage of salesman today in the future quantitative demand will be great because of the expansion of the economy and the qualitative need will be great still while many company have do fine work in develop sales personnel much of it have be product rather than sales train nor have the train be enough in relation to the need most marketing people agree it be go to take redouble effort to satisfy future requirement have you estimate you sales manpower need for the future both quantitatively and qualitatively have you company develop selection and train process that be gear to provide the caliber of salesman you will need in the next 10 yr shortage of sales management talent with the grow complexity of market and intensity of competition sales management whether at the district region or headquarters level be a tough job today and it will be tough in the future man qualify for the broad task of marketing manager be even more scarce due to the demand combination of qualification call for by this type of management work the growth of business have outdistance the available supply and the demand will continue to exceed the supply in the sixties do you company have a program for select and develop sales and marketing management personnel for the long term do you management climate and you management compensation plan attract and keep top-notch marketing people complexity of complete marketing plan every single problem touch on thus far be relate to good marketing plan hip-pocket tactic be go to be hard to apply many food and beverage company be already on a highly plan basis they have to be with great investment in plant facility with automation grow you can nt switch around either in volume or in product design a much a be formerly possible or at least not a economically be plan and strategy development emphasize sufficiently in you company we find too many sales and marketing executive so burden with detail that they be short-changing plan be annual marketing plan review throughout you management group to get the perspective of all individual and get everyone on the marketing team do you have a long-term 5 - or 10-yr marketing program the key to effective marketing be wrap up in define you company s marketing problem realistically solution frequently suggest themselves when you accurately pinpoint you problem whether they be in the market in marketing method or in marketing management if company will take the time to give objective consideration to they major problem and to the question they provoke then a long constructive step will have be take toward more effective marketing in next decade
