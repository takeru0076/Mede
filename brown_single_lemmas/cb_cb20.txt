escalation unto death the nuclear war be already be fight except that the bomb be not be drop on enemy target not yet it be be fight moreover in fairly close correspondence with the prediction of the soothsayer of the think factory they predict escalation and escalation be what we be get the big nuclear device the unite state have explode measure some 15 megaton although we b-52s be say to be carry two 20-megaton bomb apiece some time ago however mr khrushchev decide that when big bomb be make the soviet union would make they he seem to have at least a few 30 - and 50-megaton bomb on hand since we can not assume that he have explode he entire stock and now of course the hue and cry for counter-escalation be be raise on we side khrushchev threaten we with a 100-megaton bomb so be it then we must embark on a crash program for 200-megaton bomb of the common or hydrogen variety and neutron bomb which do not exist but be say to be the come thing so escalation proceed ad infinitum or more accurately until the contestant begin drop they on each other instead of on they respective prove ground what be need philip morrison write in the cornell daily sun october 26 be a discontinuity the escalation must end sometime and probably quite soon only a discontinuity can end it professor morrison write the discontinuity can either be that of war to destruction or that of diplomatic policy morrison point out that since we country be more urbanize than the soviet union or red china it be the most vulnerable of the great power europe of course must be write off out of hand he feel therefore that to seek a discontinuity in the arm policy of the unite state be the least risky path we government can take he proposal be oppose to that of richard nixon governor rockefeller past chairman strauss and mccone of the atomic energy commission dr edward teller and those other now enjoy they hour of triumph in the exacerbation of the cold war these gentleman be call for a resumption of test in the atmosphere on the great possible scale all in the name of national security escalation be they first love and they last they will be faithful unto death capable a they mind may be in some direction these guardian of the nation s security be incapable of learn or even of observe if this capacity have not fail they they would see that they enemy have make a disastrous miscalculation he have gain only one thing he have explode a 50-megaton bomb and he probably have rocket with sufficient thrust to lob it over the short intercontinental range but if he purpose be to inspire terror he action could hardly have miscarry more obviously not terror but anger and resentment have be the general reaction outside the soviet sphere khrushchev himself be report to be concern by the surge of animosity he have arouse yet we own nuclear statesman seem intent on follow compulsively in he footstep when one powerful nation strive to emulate the success of another it be only natural thus when the russian send up they first sputnik american chagrin be human enough and american determination to put american satellite into orbit be perfectly understandable but to imitate an opponent when he have make the mistake of he life would be a new high in statesmanlike folly the tide turn when east german flee to the west by the thousands paean of joy rise from the throat of western publicist they be less vocal now when it be the west berliner who be migrate the flood be not a great only 700 a week accord to one apparently conservative account but it be symptomatic west berlin morale be low and in age distribution the situation be unfavorable nearly 18 per cent of west berlin s 2200000 resident be sixty-five or old only 128 per cent be under fifteen r h s crossman mp write in the manchester guardian state that departure from west berlin be now run at the rate not of 700 but of 1700 a week and application to leave have rise to 1900 a week the official statistics show that 60 per cent be employ worker or independent professional people whole family be move and removal firm be book for month ahead the weekly loss be partly counterbalance by 500 arrival each week from west germany but the hard truth say crossman be that the close off of east berlin without interference from the west and with the use only of east german a distinct from russian troop be a major communist victory which deal west berlin a deadly possibly a fatal blow the gallant half-city be die on it foot another piece of evidence appear in a dispatch from bonn in the observer london mark arnold-foster write people be leave west berlin because they think it be die they be leave so fast that the president of the west german employer federation issue an appeal this week to factory worker in the west to volunteer for six month front-line work in factory in west berlin berlin s resilience be amaze but if it have to hire it labor in the west the struggle will be hard indeed the handwriting be on the wall the only hope for west berlin lie in a compromise which will bring down the wall and reunite the city state department official refuse to show they pass at the boundary and drive two block into east berlin under military escort will not avail tank line up at the border will be no more helpful the material for compromise be at hand the nation walter lippmann and other sober commentator see alan clark on p 367 have spell they out again and again a compromise will leave both side without the glow of triumph but it will save berlin or the city can be a graveyard monument to western intransigence if that be what the west want vacancy the removal of stalin s body from the mausoleum he share with lenin to less distinguish quarter in the kremlin wall be not unprecedented in history it be in fact a relatively mild chastisement of the dead a british writer richard haestier in a book dead man tell tale recall that in the turmoil precede the french revolution the body of henry 4 who have die nearly 180 year early be tear to piece by a mob and in england after the restoration the body of cromwell be disinter and hang at tyburn the head be then fix on a pole at westminster and the rest of the body be bury under the gallows contemplate these posthumous punishment stalin should not lose all hope in 1899 parliament erect a statue to cromwell in westminster face whitehall and there presumably he still stand nikita khrushchev however have create yet another problem for himself the lenin tomb be obviously adequate for double occupancy moscow be a crowd city and the creed of communism deplore waste who will take stalin s place beside lenin there be karl marx of course bury in london the macmillan government might be will to let he go but he have be dead seventy-eight year and even the soviet mortician could not make he look presentable who then be of sufficient stature to lodge with lenin who but nikita himself since he have just show who be top dog he may not be ready to receive this high honor in the gift of the soviet people besides he can hardly avoid muse on the instability of death which what with exhumation and rehabilitation seem to match that of life suppose he do lie beside lenin would it be permanent if some future khrushchev decide to rake up the misdeed of he rever predecessor would not the factory worker pass the same resolution applaud he dispossession when a man be lay to rest he be entitle to stay put if nikita buy a small plot in some modest rural cemetery everyone will understand u thant of burma the appointment of u thant of burma a the un s act secretary general at this write the choice appear to be certain offer far proof that in politics it be more important to have no influential enemy than to have influential friend mongi slim of tunisia and frederick boland of ireland be early favorite in the run but france do nt like the former and the soviet union would have none of the latter with the neutralist maintain pressure for one of they own to succeed mr hammarskjold u thant emerge a the only possible candidate unlikely to be waylay by a veto what be interest be that he positive qualification for the post be reveal only a a kind of tail to he candidacy in all the bitter in-fighting the squabble over election procedure the complicate number game that east and west play on the assistant secretary theme the gentleman from burma show himself both a a man of principle and a skilled diplomat he have moreover another qualification which augur well for the future he be a buddhist which mean that to he peace and the sanctity of human life be not only religious dogma but a profound and unshakable weltanschauung u thant of course will hold office until the spring of 1963 when mr hammarskjold s term would have come to an end whether the compromise on both side that make possible the interim appointment can then be repeat remain to be see mr khrushchev s demand for a troika be dormant not dead the west may or not remain satisfy with the kind of neutralism that u thant represent in a sense the showdown promise by mr hammarskjold s sudden and tragic death have be avoid no precedent have be set a yet structurally the un be still fluid vulnerable to the pressure that it new and enlarge membership be bring to bear upon it but at least the pessimist who believe that the world organization have plunge to it death in that plane crash in the congo have be prove wrong to the hill girl no one who have study the radical right can suppose that word be they sole staple in trade these be mentality which crave action and they be begin to get it a messrs salsich and engh report on page 372 even in area where political connotation be deliberately leave vague the spirit of vigilantism be spread friend a
