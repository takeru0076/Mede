rare indeed be the harlem citizen from the most circumspect church member to the most shiftless adolescent who do not have a long tale to tell of police incompetence injustice or brutality i myself have witness and endure it more than once the businessman and racketeer also have a story and so do the prostitute and this be not perhaps the place to discuss harlem s very complex attitude toward black policeman nor the reason accord to harlem that they be nearly all downtown it be hard on the other hand to blame the policeman blank good-natured thoughtless and insuperably innocent for be such a perfect representative of the people he serve he too believe in good intention and be astound and offend when they be not take for the deed he have never himself do anything for which to be hate which of we have and yet he be face daily and nightly people who would gladly see he dead and he know it there be no way for he not to know it there be few thing under heaven more unnerve than the silent accumulate contempt and hatred of a people he move through harlem therefore like an occupy soldier in a bitterly hostile country which be precisely what and where he be and be the reason he walk in twos and threes and he be not the only one who know why he be always in company the people who be watch he know why too any street meet sacred or secular which he and he colleague uneasily cover have a it explicit or implicit burden the cruelty and injustice of the white domination and these day of course in term increasingly vivid and jubilant it speak of the end of that domination the white policeman stand on a harlem street corner find himself at the very center of the revolution now occur in the world he be not prepare for it naturally nobody be and what be possibly much more to the point he be expose a few white people be to the anguish of the black people around he even if he be gift with the mere mustard grain of imagination something must seep in he can not avoid observe that some of the child in spite of they color remind he of child he have know and love perhaps even of he own child he know that he certainly do not want he child live this way he can retreat from he uneasiness in only one direction into a callousness which very shortly become second nature he become more callous the population become more hostile the situation grow more tense and the police force be increase one day to everyone s astonishment someone drop a match in the powder keg and everything blow up before the dust have settle or the blood congeal editorial speech and civil-rights commission be loud in the land demand to know what happen what happen be that negroes want to be treat like man negroes want to be treat like man a perfectly straightforward statement contain only seven word people who have master kant hegel shakespeare marx freud and the bible find this statement utterly impenetrable the idea seem to threaten profound barely conscious assumption a kind of panic paralyze they feature a though they find themselves trap on the edge of a steep place i once try to describe to a very well-known american intellectual the condition among negroes in the south i recital disturb he and make he indignant and he ask i in perfect innocence why do nt all the negroes in the south move north i try to explain what have happen unfailingly whenever a significant body of negroes move north they do not escape jim crow they merely encounter another not-less-deadly variety they do not move to chicago they move to the south side they do not move to new york they move to harlem the pressure within the ghetto cause the ghetto wall to expand and this expansion be always violent white people hold the line a long a they can and in a many way a they can from verbal intimidation to physical violence but inevitably the border which have divide the ghetto from the rest of the world fall into the hand of the ghetto the white people fall back bitterly before the black horde the landlord make a tidy profit by raise the rent chop up the room and all but dispense with the upkeep and what have once be a neighborhood turn into a turf this be precisely what happen when the puerto rican arrive in they thousands and the bitterness thus cause be a i write be fight out all up and down those street northerner indulge in an extremely dangerous luxury they seem to feel that because they fight on the right side during the civil war and win they have earn the right merely to deplore what be go on in the south without take any responsibility for it and that they can ignore what be happen in northern city because what be happen in little rock or birmingham be bad well in the first place it be not possible for anyone who have not endure both to know which be bad i know negroes who prefer the south and white southerner because at least there you have nt get to play any guess game the guess game refer to have drive more than one negro into the narcotic ward the madhouse or the river i know another negro a man very dear to i who say with conviction and with truth the spirit of the south be the spirit of america he be bear in the north and do he military train in the south he do not a far a i can gather find the south bad he find it if anything all too familiar in the second place though even if birmingham be bad no doubt johannesburg south africa beat it by several mile and buchenwald be one of the bad thing that ever happen in the entire history of the world the world have never lack for horrifying example but i do not believe that these example be mean to be use a justification for we own crime this perpetual justification empty the heart of all human feel the empty we heart become the great will be we crime thirdly the south be not merely an embarrassingly backward region but a part of this country and what happen there concern every one of we a far a the color problem be concern there be but one great difference between the southern white and the northerner the southerner remember historically and in he own psyche a kind of eden in which he love black people and they love he historically the flame sword lay across this eden be the civil war personally it be the southerner s sexual come of age when without any warn unbreakable taboo be set up between himself and he past everything thereafter be permit he except the love he remember and have never cease to need the result indescribable torment affect every southern mind and be the basis of the southern hysteria none of this be true for the northerner negroes represent nothing to he personally except perhaps the danger of carnality he never see negroes southerner see they all the time northerner never think about they whereas southerner be never really think of anything else negroes be therefore ignore in the north and be under surveillance in the south and suffer hideously in both place neither the southerner nor the northerner be able to look on the negro simply a a man it seem to be indispensable to the national self-esteem that the negro be consider either a a kind of ward in which case we be tell how many negroes comparatively buy cadillac last year and how few comparatively be lynch or a a victim in which case we be promise that he will never vote in we assembly or go to school with we kid they be two side of the same coin and the south will not change can not change until the north change the country will not change until it re-examine itself and discover what it really mean by freedom in the meantime generation keep be bear bitterness be increase by incompetence pride and folly and the world shrink around we it be a terrible an inexorable law that one can not deny the humanity of another without diminish one s own in the face of one s victim one see oneself walk through the street of harlem and see what we this nation have become 4 east river downtown postscript to a letter from harlem the fact that american negroes riot in the un while adlai stevenson be address the assembly shock and baffle most white american stevenson s speech and the spectacular disturbance in the gallery be both touch off by the death in katanga the day before of patrice lumumba stevenson state in the course of he address that the unite state be against colonialism god know what the african nation who hold 25 per cent of the vote stock in the un be think they may for example have be think of the we abstention when the vote on algerian freedom be before the assembly but i think i have a fairly accurate notion of what the negroes in the gallery be think i have intend to be there myself it be i first reaction upon hear of lumumba s death i be curious about the impact of this political assassination on negroes in harlem for lumumba have have capture the popular imagination there i be curious to know if lumumba s death which be surely among the most sinister of recent event would elicit from we side anything more than the usual well-meaning rhetoric and i be curious about the african reaction however the chaos on i desk prevent i be in the un gallery have i be there i too in the eye of most american would have be merely a pawn in the hand of the communist the climate and the event of the last decade and the steady pressure of the cold war have give american yet another mean of avoid self-examination and so it have be decide that the riot be communist inspire nor be it long naturally before prominent negroes rush forward to assure the republic that the un rioter do not represent the real feel of the negro community accord then to what i take to be the prevail view these rioter be merely a handful of irresponsible stalinist-corrupted provocateur i find this view amaze it be a view which even a minimal effort at observation would immediately contradict one have only for example to walk through harlem and ask oneself two question the first question be would i like to live here and the second question be why do nt those who now live here move out the answer to both question be immediately obvious unless one take refuge in the theory however disguise that negroes be somehow different from white people i do not see how one can escape the conclusion that the negro s status in this country be not only a cruel injustice but a grave national liability now i do not doubt that among the people at the un that day there be stalinist and professional revolutionists act out of the most cynical motive wherever there be great social discontent these people be sooner or late to be find they presence be not a frighten a the discontent which create they opportunity what i find appal and really dangerous be the american assumption that the negro be so content with he lot here that only the cynical agent of a foreign power can rouse he to protest it be a notion which contain a gratuitous insult imply a it do that negroes can make no move unless they be manipulate
