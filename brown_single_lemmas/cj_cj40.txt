in assess the outlook for interest rate in 1961 the question a always be the prospect for general business activity by and large what happen to business a a whole will govern the relationship between demand and supply condition in the capital market and will thus determine interest rate moreover the trend of general business activity in 1961 will exert a decisive influence on fiscal monetary and other federal policy which affect interest rate nineteen-sixty have be a baffle year for analyst of general business activity during much of the year the general level of business activity have move along on a record-high plateau but there have be persistent sign of slack in the economy the tendency for general business activity to soften somewhat be become more evident although the pause in the advance of general business activity this year have thus far be quite modest it be hard to escape the conclusion that the soften process will continue into the first quarter of 1961 and possibly somewhat long it be difficult to see any powerful source of strength on the horizon at this time which would give the economy a new upward thrust the rate of plant and equipment spend by business and industry now seem to be top out and face some decline in early business cycle when this occur the country usually experience a sharp upturn in residential construction a mortgage finance become easy to obtain at this time however there be sign that increase availability of mortgage credit will not act with the usual speed to stimulate a sharp rise in residential construction these sign be the inventory of unsold house in some area of the country and the moderate rise in vacancy rate for apartment 76 % in september on the other hand in a more favorable vein general business activity should receive some stimulus from rise federal spend and the reduction in business inventory have probably run a good part of it course the 2 % increase in retail sales in october to a 4-month high be encourage in this connection a well a the most recent consumer survey by the national industrial conference board which show a decide pickup in consumer spend plan the pattern of general business activity which probably lie ahead of we be a far moderate soften through the spring of 1961 before a new rise in economic activity get under way the recovery will probably be spark by a rise rate of house start next spring in response to more readily available mortgage credit a well a by an expansion of government spend well sustain consumer spend and some rebuild of business inventory slight downward pressure what do the general business outlook suggest about the trend of long-term rate in 1961 it suggest that during the next several month through the spring of 1961 the demand for long-term capital fund may be moderately low and that interest rate may tend to move a little low especially the rate on federal state and local bond a well a those on publicly offer corporate bond however a witness by the large corporate bond calendar at present a well a the record amount of municipal bond issue approve by voter the over-all demand for capital fund seem likely to remain high so that any downward pressure on rate from reduce demand should not be great it seem likely moreover that with an increase in the rate of save in mortgage lend institution interest rate on residential mortgage may move somewhat low through the spring of next year although the increase ease in residential mortgage lend may occur primarily in other term than interest rate eg easy downpayment and amortization term if the trend of general business activity follow the pattern suggest here we be likely to see additional step by the federal reserve authority to ease the availability of credit certainly a far reduction in the discount rate would be a strong possibility a well a an easy reserve position for the bank system however the monetary authority will continue to be require to pay attention to the consequence of they action with respect to we international balance of payment position and the outflow of gold a well a with regard to avoid the creation of excessive liquidity in the economy which would delay the effectiveness of monetary policy measure in the next expansion phase of the business cycle open market policy one of the most intriguing question be whether the recent departure of the federal reserve authority from confine they open market operation to treasury bill will spread into longer-term government security in the next few month to the extent that the new administration have it wish the federal reserve would conduct it open market operation throughout the entire maturity range of government security and aggressively seek to force down long-term interest rate the principle of bill only or bill preferably seem so strongly accept by the federal reserve that it be difficult to envision condition which would persuade the authority to depart radically from it by extend they open market purchase regularly into long-term government security however to the extent that the monetary authority in they effort to ease credit in the next several month conduct they open market operation in longer-term government bond they will certainly act to accentuate any tendency for long-term interest rate to ease a a result of market force by the end of the spring of 1961 assume that a general business recovery get under way interest rate should begin to edge upward again depend upon the vigor of the recovery and the determination with which the monetary authority move to restrain credit availability i guess would be that interest rate will decline moderately into the spring of 1961 and during the second half of the year will turn up gradually to recover the ground lose during the downturn it be pertinent to ask the question have the long upswing of interest rate during the past 15 year just about run it course and be we now enter a period in which both capital market force and federal policy will produce a prolong decline of interest rate i answer be in the negative because i believe that total capital demand during the sixties will continue to press against available supply and interest rate will generally tend to be firm at high level five basic force this view be base upon several basic economic force which i believe will be operate in the sixties a follow 1 recent event in the general assembly of the unite nation confirm that the cold war will remain with we and probably intensify for the foreseeable future this make it certain that federal expenditure for military preparedness and foreign economic aid be likely to rise far in the next several year we be just begin the task of try to win or maintain the friendship of the new african nation against the ruthless competition of the communist bloc we effort to overcome the lead of the russian in space be bind to mean accelerate federal spend moreover it be likely that federal policy aim at stimulate a fast rate of economic growth of the country to keep ahead of the communist country and to demonstrate that we free economic system be good than theirs will lead to rise federal spend in certain area such a education house medical aid and the like there be serious danger involve in this trend toward rise federal expenditure of which i take a dim view but it seem very likely to occur 2 during the sixties we have the prospect of a significant step up in the rate of household formation which should contribute to a rise volume of consumer expenditure and home build accord to the late projection of the bureau of the census the annual rate of household formation will increase for the next 20 year under the most favorable assumption for increase the bureau of the census project that the annual rate of household formation will rise from about 883000 in the last two year of the fifties to an annual rate of about 1018000 in the first five year of the sixties and to a slightly high annual rate of 1083000 in the second half of the decade during the seventies the projection show a more pronounce rise to an annual rate of 1338000 in the second half of that decade accordingly the expand market for consumer goods and house occasion by the high rate of household formation should enhance the general economic prospect of the sixties however the impact of a rise rate of household formation this decade should not be exaggerate the average annual rate of 1083000 in the second half of the sixties be still considerably below the annual rate of 1525000 in the three-year period from april 1947 to march 1950 3 with the expansion of family formation in the sixties a continue substantial rise in expenditure by state and local government unit seem to be indicate this be an area in which there be still a large backlog of demand state and local expenditure in real term increase persistently from $ 265-billion in 1949 to $ 443-billion in 1959 and it would not be surprise if they show a comparable increase in this decade which would carry they to the neighborhood of $ 75-billion by 1970 here would be a powerful force for raise business activity 4 it seem likely that with the three precede force at play the rate of business and industrial plant and equipment expenditure should continue to move upward from the level of the fifties spur by keen competition in we industrial system and still far increase in the fund devote to industrial research plant and equipment expenditure by business and industry should rise during the decade 5 in a more pessimistic vein about the economic outlook i suspect that the reservoir of demand for consumer goods and house which be dammed-up during the thirties and world war 2 be finally in the process of run dry there be some clear-cut evidence of this for example the huge postwar demand on the part of veteran for house under the va home loan guaranty program seem to have largely exhaust itself indeed the failure of home-building a a whole to respond this year to somewhat great availability of mortgage finance and the increase report of pocket of unsold home and rise vacancy rate in apartment building may also signal in part that the lush day of big backlog demand for house be reach an end in a way we may be witness the same thing in the sales of automobile today a the public no long be will to purchase any car come on the market but be more insistent on compact car free of the frill which be accept in the fifties the huge backlog of demand which be evident in the first decade and a half after the war be feed by liquid asset accumulate by the public during the war and even more so by the easy and easy credit in the consumer loan and home loan field the consume public have use up a good part of these liquid asset or they have be drain by the rise price level and we have apparently get to the end of the line in make consumer or home mortgage term easy this be not to say that the level of consumer expenditure will not continue to rise in the sixties i be confident that it will but consumer spend in the sixties will not be fortify by the great backlog of want and desire which characterize most of the fifties market should become more competitive a consumer become more selective sixties capital requirement accordingly during the sixties we national economy be likely to grow at a fast a rate a in the fifties and in the process to require enormous amount of capital fund
