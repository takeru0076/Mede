tobacco road be dead long live tobacco road nostalgic yankee reader of erskine caldwell be today inform by proud georgian that tobacco road be bury beneath a four-lane super highway over which travel each day suburbanite businessman more concern with the dow-jones average than with the cotton crop thus we be compel to face the urbanization of the south an urbanization which despite it dramatic and overwhelming effect upon the southern culture have be utterly ignore by the bulk of southern writer indeed it seem that only in today s southern fiction do tobacco road with all the traditional trimming of sowbelly and cornbread and mint julep continue to live but only a a weary overexploited phantom those writer know collectively a the southern school have receive accolade from even those critic least prone to eulogize accord to many critic in fact the south have lead the north in literature since the civil war both quantitatively and qualitatively such writer a william faulkner and robert penn warren have lead the field of somewhat less important writer in a sort of post-bellum renaissance it be interest however that despite this strong upsurge in southern write almost none of the writer have forsake the firmly entrench concept of the white-suited big-daddy colonel sip a mint julep a he silently recount the revenue from the season s cotton and tobacco crop of the stereotyp negro servant chant hymn a they plow the field of these and a host of other antiquated legend that deny the south it progressive leap of the past century this be not to say that the south be no long agrarian such a statement would be the rank form of oversimplification but the south be and have be for the past century engage in a wide-sweeping urbanization which oddly enough be not reflect in it literature in 1900 the south be only 15 % urban in 1950 it have become 471 % urban in a mere half-century the south have more than triple it urban status there be a new south emerge a south lose the folksy tradition of an agrarian society with the rapidity of an avalanche especially within recent decade a the new south snowball toward far urbanization it become more and more homogeneous with the north a tendency which willard thorp term yankeefication a evidence in such city a charlotte birmingham and houston it be say that even at the present stage of southern urbanization such a city a atlanta be not distinctly unlike columbus or trenton undoubtedly even the old southern stalwart richmond have feel the new wind william styron mention in he late novel an avenue name for bankhead mcgruder a civil war general now rename in typical california fashion buena vista terrace the effect of television and other mass media be erase regional dialect and localisms with a startle force a for progress the backward south can boast of baton rouge which increase it population between 1940 and 1950 by two hundred and sixty-two percent to 126000 the second large growth of the period for all city over 25000 the field then be ripe for new southerner to step to the fore and write of this twentieth-century phenomenon the southern yankeefication the new urban economy the city-dweller the pain of transition the labor problem the list be obviously endless but these source have not be tap truman capote be still reveling in southern gothicism exaggerate the old southern legend into something beautiful and grotesque but a unreal a or even more unreal than yesterday william styron while face the change economy with a certain uneasy reluctance insist he be not to be classify a a southern writer and yet include traditional southern concept in everything he publish even the great god faulkner the south s one probable contender for literary immortality have little concern himself with these matter such be simply not within he bound province where be the writer to treat these change have the agrarian tradition become such an addiction that the switch to urbanism be somehow dread or unwanted perhaps present writer hypnotically cling to the old order because they consider it useful and reliable through repeat testing over the decade lack the pioneer spirit necessary to write of a new economy these writer seem to be content themselves with an old one that be now a defunct a confederate money an example of the change which have creep over the southern region may be see in the southern negro s quest for a position in the white-dominated society a problem that have be reflect in regional fiction especially since 1865 today the negro must discover he role in an industrialize south which indicate that the racial aspect of the southern dilemma have nt change radically but rather have gradually come to be reflect in this new context this new coat of paint the negro face a much if not more difficulty in fit himself into an urban economy a he do in an agrarian one this represent a gradual change in an ever-present social problem but there have be abrupt change a well the sit-in the picket line the bus strike all of these be unheard-of even ten year ago today s evidence such a the fact that only three southern state south carolina alabama and mississippi still openly defy integration would have astound many of yesterday s southerner into speechlessness other example of gradual change that have affect the negro have be he move up row by row in the bus he request and often get high wage good work condition good school change that be slowly emerge even before the supreme court decision of 1954 then come this decision which speed the process of gain equality or perhaps hinder it only historical evolution will determine which an abrupt change since 1954 the negro s desire for social justice have lead to an ironically anarchical rebellion he have frequently refuse to move from white lunch counter refuse to obey local law which he consider unjust while in other case he have appeal to federal law this bold self-assertion after decade of humble subservience be indeed a twentieth-century phenomenon an abrupt change in the southern way of existence a new order be thrust itself into be a new south be emerge after the post-bellum year of hesitation uncertainty and lack of action from the negro in define he new role in the amorphously define socio-political organization of the white man the modern negro have not make a decisive debut into southern fiction it be clear that while most writer enjoy picture the negro a a woolly-headed humble old agrarian who mutter yassuhs and sho nufs with blissful deference to he white employer or in old south term massuh this stereotype be doom to become in reality a obsolete a caldwell s lester while there may still be many faulknerian lucas beauchamp scatter through the rural south such man appear to be a vanish breed writer openly admit that the negro be easy to write than the white man but they obviously mean by this not a negro personality but a negro type present an individualize negro character it would seem be one of the most difficult assignment a southern writer could tackle and the success of such an endeavor be a suggest above glaringly rare just a the negro situation point up the gradual and abrupt change affect southern life it also point up the non-representation of urbanism in southern literature the book concern with the negro s role in an urban society be rare indeed recently only keith wheeler s novel peaceable lane have openly face the problem all but the most rabid of confederate flag waver admit that the old southern tradition be defunct in actuality and sigh that it pass be accompany by the disappearance of many genteel and aristocratic tradition of the reputedly languid ante-bellum way of life many early writer mourn the demise of the old order tend to romanticize and exaggerate this gracious old south imagery create such last impression a margaret mitchell s tara plantation modern writer who be suppose to keep they finger firmly upon the pulse of they subject insist upon draw out this legend prolong it burial when it well deserve a rest after the overexploitation of the past century perhaps these writer have be too deeply move by this romanticize but they can hardly deny that exaggerate or not the old panorama be dead a john t westbrook say in he article twilight of southern regionalism southwest review winter 1957 the miasmal mausoleum where an old south already too minutely autopsy in prose and poetry should be leave to rest in peace forever dead and let we fervently hope forever do with westbrook far bemoan the southern writer creation of an unreal image of they homeland which be too readily assimilate by both foreign reader and visit yankee we northerner be suspicious of all this crass evidence of urbanization present to he sense it bewilder and befuddles he he be too deeply steep in william faulkner and robert penn warren the fume of progress be in he nose and the bright steel of industry tower before he eye but he heart be away in yoknapatawpha county with razorback hog and night rider on this trip to the south he want above all else to sniff the effluvium of backwoods-and-sand-hill subhumanity and to see at least one barn burn at midnight obviously such a northern tourist s purpose be somewhat akin to a child s experience with disneyland he want to see a world of make-believe in the meantime while the south have be undergo this phenomenal modernization that be so disappoint to the curious yankee southern writer have certainly do little to reflect and promote they region s progress willard thorp in he new book american write in the twentieth century observe quite validly it seem certain subject be conspicuously absent or have be only lightly touch no southern novelist have do for atlanta or birmingham what herrick dreiser and farrell do for chicago or do passo do for new york there be almost no fictional treatment of the industrialize south not a single southern author major or minor have make the urban problem of an urban south he primary source material faulkner for one appear to be safe from the accuse finger of all assailant in this regard faulkner culminate the southern legend perhaps more masterfully than it have ever be or could ever be do he have make it he and he it remain irrevocably he treat it with a mythological universal application a he disciple boast even though he emphasis be elsewhere faulkner do show he awareness of the change order of the south quite keenly a can be prove by a quick recall of he sartoris and snopes family even two decade ago in go down moses faulkner be look to the more urban future with a glimmer of hope that through it youth and it new way of life the south might be reborn and the curse of slavery erase from it soil yet he concern even here be with a slowly change socio-economic order in general and he never deal with such specific aspect of this change a the urban and industrial impact faulkner trace in he vast and overpower saga of yoknapatawpha county the gradual change which seep into the south build layer upon layer of minute subtle innovation which eventually tend largely to hide the old way thus faulkner remind we and wisely that the new south have gradually evolve out of the old south and consequently it agrarian root persist yet he present a realm of source material which may well serve other writer if not himself the problem with which a new south must grapple in grope through a blind adolescence into the maturity of urbanization with new mechanization the modern farmer must perform the work of six man a machine stand between the agrarian and he soil the thousands of city migrant who desert the farm yearly must readjust with even great stress and tension the sacred wilderness be gradually surrender to suburb and research park and industrial area
