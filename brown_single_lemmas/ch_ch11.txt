another recent achievement be the successful development of a method for the complete combustion in a bomb calorimeter of a metal in fluorine when the product be relatively non-volatile this work give a heat of formation of aluminum fluoride which closely substantiate a value which have be determine by a less direct method and raise this property to 15 percent above that accept a few year ago similar measurement be be initiate to resolve a large discrepancy in the heat of formation of another important combustion product beryllium fluoride the development and test of new apparatus to measure other property be near completion in one of these an exploding-wire device to study system thermodynamically up to 6000 afj and 100 atmosphere pressure a major goal be achieve the accuracy of measure the total electrical energy enter an explode wire during a few microsecond be verify when two independent type of comparison with the heat energy produce have an uncertainty of less than 2 percent this agreement be consider very good for such short time interval the method of calibration employ a fix resistance element a a calorimeter the element be insert in the discharge circuit in place of the explode wire and the calorimetric heat of the element be measure with high accuracy this be use a a reference for compare the ohmic heat and the electrical energy obtain from the measure current through the element and the measure voltage across the element a high-speed shutter have be develop in order to permit photographic observation of any portion of the electrical wire explosion the shutter consist of two part a fast-opening part and a fast-closing part use edgerton s method the fast-closing action be obtain from the blacken of a window by explode a series of parallel lead wire the fast-opening of the shutter consist of a piece of aluminum foil approximately afj place directly in front of the camera lens so that no light may pass into the camera the open action be obtain when a capacitor charge to high voltage be suddenly discharge through the foil during the discharge the magnetic force set up by the passage of current cause the edge of the foil to roll inward toward it center line thus allow light to pass into the camera experiment have show that the shutter be 75 percent open in about 60-80 microsecond the shutter aperture may be make large or small by change the foil area and adjust the electrical energy input to the foil laboratory measurement of interstellar radio spectrum besides the well-known hydrogen line at 21 cm wavelength the spectrum of extraterrestrial radio source may contain sharp line characteristic of other atom ion and small molecule the detection and study of such line spectrum would add considerably to present information on interstellar gas cloud and perhaps planetary atmosphere among the most likely producer of detectable radio line spectrum be the light diatomic hydride oh and ch somewhat less likely source be the heavy hydride sh sih and afj very small concentration of these hydride should be detectable in interstellar gas concentration a low a afj molecule per afj may be sufficient a compare to the afj hydrogen atom s afj require for detection of the 21-cm line high sensitivity in radio telescope be achieve by reduce the bandwidth of the receiver therefore only with precise foreknowledge of the line frequency be an astronomical search for the radio spectrum of these molecule feasible to secure precise measurement of these frequency a research program in free radical microwave spectroscopy have be start since conventional method be insensitive at the low frequency of these molecular transition the paramagnetic resonance method be be use instead this involve the application of a strong magnetic field to the radical vapor which shift the low-frequency spectrum to a conveniently high microwave range where they may be measure with optimum sensitivity the first diatomic hydride investigate by the paramagnetic resonance method be the oh radical result of this experiment include the frequency of the two strong spectral line by which oh may be identify in interstellar gas the frequency be 166532 and 166736 afj with an uncertainty of 010 afj success in observe these spectral line have so far apparently be confine to the laboratory extraterrestrial observation have yet to be report preparation be be make for similar experiment on ch and sh radical low temperature thermometry the bureau be pursue an active program to provide a temperature scale and thermometer calibration service in the range 15 to 20 afj the effort and accomplishment fall into three main category absolute thermometry base upon the velocity of sound in helium gas secondary thermometry involve principally study of the behavior of germanium resistor and helium-4 vapor-pressure measurement see p 144 acoustical interferometer an acoustical interferometer have be construct and use with helium gas a the thermometric fluid to measure temperature near 42 and 21 afj such an interferometer provide a mean of absolute temperature measurement and may be use a an alternative to the gas thermometer when value of temperature derive with this instrument be compare with the accept value associate with liquid helium-4 vapor pressure difference of about 10 and 7 millidegrees respectively be find this result be preliminary and work be continue resistance thermometer carbon resistor and impurity-doped germanium resistor have be investigate for use a precision secondary thermometer in the liquid helium temperature region several germanium resistor have be thermally cycle from 300 to 42 afj and they resistance have be find to be reproducible within 13 millidegree when temperature be derive from a vapor pressure thermometer whose tubing be jackete through most of the liquid helium preliminary calibration of the resistor have be make from 421 to 216 afj at every 01 afj the estimate standard deviation of the data for two of the resistor be 1 millidegree and for the third resistor 33 millidegrees vapor pressure method the reproducibilities of helium vapor-pressure thermometer have be investigate in conjunction with a constant temperature liquid helium bath from 42 to 18 afj surface temperature gradient have be find to exist in liquid helium bath contain in 15 - and 25-liter metallic storage dewars the gradient be about one half of a millidegree at 42 afj but increase to several millidegrees for bath temperature slightly great than the \*\* yl point a hydrostatic head correction have be neither necessary nor applicable in the determination of vapor pressure or temperature for the bulk liquid helium however the surface temperature gradient can produce erroneous vapor-pressure measurement for the bulk liquid helium unless precaution be take to isolate the tube which pass through the surface to the vapor pressure bulb from the liquid helium surface it have also be observe in helium 2 that large discrepancy can exist between surface vapor pressure and those pressure measure by a vapor pressure thermometer this have be attribute to helium film flow in the vapor pressure thermometer in this case also the design of the thermometer can be modify to reduce the helium film flow pressure transducer for pvt measurement precise pressure-volume-temperature measurement on corrosive gas be dependent on a sensitive yet rugged pressure transducer a prototype which fulfill the requirement be develop and thoroughly test the transducer be a null-type instrument and employ a stretch diaphragm 0001 in thick and 1 in in diameter a small pressure unbalance displace the diaphragm and change the capacitance between the diaphragm and an electrically insulate plate space 0001 in apart for afj spherical concave back surface support the diaphragm when excessive pressure be apply and prevent the stress within the diaphragm from exceed the elastic limit over a temperature range from 25 to 200 afj and at pressure up to 250 atm an overload of 300 psi apply for a period of one day result in an uncertainty in the pressure of at most one millimeter
