for you to take yet mercer never notice the needle touch he arm bdikkat have turn to the next knot of people when the super-condamine hit mercer he try to run after bdikkat to hug the lead spacesuit to tell bdikkat that he love he he stumble and fall but it do not hurt the many-bodied girl lie near he mercer speak to she be nt it wonderful you re beautiful beautiful beautiful i m so happy to be here the woman cover with grow hand come and sit beside they she radiate warmth and good fellowship mercer think that she look very distinguish and charm he struggle out of he clothe it be foolish and snobbish to wear clothing when none of these nice people do the two woman babble and croon at he with one corner of he mind he know that they be say nothing just express the euphoria of a drug so powerful that the know universe have forbid it with most of he mind he be happy he wonder how anyone could have the good luck to visit a planet a nice a this he try to tell the lady da but the word be nt quite straight a painful stab hit he in the abdomen the drug go after the pain and swallow it it be like the cap in the hospital only a thousand time good the pain be go though it have be cripple the first time he force himself to be deliberate he ram he mind into focus and say to the two lady who lie pinkly nude beside he in the desert that be a good bite maybe i will grow another head that would make bdikkat happy the lady da force the foremost of she body in an upright position say she i m strong too i can talk remember man remember people never live forever we can die too we can die like real people i do so believe in death mercer smile at she through he happiness of course you can but be nt this nice with this he feel he lip thicken and he mind go slack he be wide awake but he do not feel like do anything in that beautiful place among all those companionable and attractive people he sit and smile bdikkat be sterilize he knife mercer wonder how long the super-condamine have last he he endure the ministration of the dromozoa without scream or movement the agony of nerve and itch of skin be phenomenon which happen somewhere near he but mean nothing he watch he own body with remote casual interest the lady da and the hand-covered woman stay near he after a long time the half-man drag himself over to the group with he powerful arm have arrive he blink sleepily and friendlily at they and lapse back into the restful stupor from which he have emerge mercer see the sun rise on occasion close he eye briefly and open they to see star shine time have no mean the dromozoa feed he in they mysterious way the drug cancel out he need for cycle of the body at last he notice a return of the inwardness of pain the pain themselves have not change he have he know all the event which could take place on shayol he remember they well from he happy period formerly he have notice they now he feel they he try to ask the lady da how long they have have the drug and how much long they would have to wait before they have it again she smile at he with benign remote happiness apparently she many torso stretch out along the ground have a great capacity for retain the drug than do he body she mean he well but be in no condition for articulate speech the half-man lie on the ground artery pulsate prettily behind the half-transparent film which protect he abdominal cavity mercer squeeze the man s shoulder the half-man wake recognize mercer and give he a healthily sleepy grin a good morrow to you i boy that s out of a play do you ever see a play you mean a game with card no say the half-man a sort of eye-machine with real people do the figure i never see that say mercer but i but you want to ask i when bdikkat be go to come back with the needle yes say mercer a little ashamed of he obviousness soon say the half-man that s why i think of play we all know what be go to happen we all know when it be go to happen we all know what the dummy will do he gesture at the hummock in which the decorticated man be cradle and we all know what the new people will ask but we never know how long a scene be go to take what s a scene ask mercer be that the name for the needle the half-man laugh with something close to real humor no no no you ve get the lovely on the brain a scene be just a part of a play i mean we know the order in which thing happen but we have no clock and nobody care enough to count day or to make calendar and there s not much climate here so none of we know how long anything take the pain seem short and the pleasure seem long i m incline to think that they be about two earth-weeks each mercer do not know what an earth-week be since he have not be a well-read man before he conviction but he get nothing more from the half-man at that time the half-man receive a dromozootic implant turn red in the face shout senselessly at mercer take it out you fool take it out of i when mercer look on helplessly the half-man twist over on he side he pink dusty back turn to mercer and weep hoarsely and quietly to himself mercer himself could not tell how long it be before bdikkat come back it might have be several day it might have be several month once again bdikkat move among they like a father once again they cluster like child this time bdikkat smile pleasantly at the little head which have grow out of mercer s thigh a sleep child s head cover with light hair on top and with dainty eyebrow over the rest eye mercer get the blissful needle when bdikkat cut the head from mercer s thigh he feel the knife grind against the cartilage which hold the head to he own body he see the child-face grimace a the head be cut he feel the far cool flash of unimportant pain a bdikkat dab the wind with a corrosive antiseptic which stop all bleed immediately the next time it be two leg grow from he chest then there have be another head beside he own or be that after the torso and leg waist to toe-tips of the little girl which have grow from he side he forget the order he do not count time lady da smile at he often but there be no love in this place she have lose the extra torso in between teratologies she be a pretty and shapely woman but the nice thing about they relationship be she whisper to he repeat some thousands of time repeat with smile and hope people never live forever she find this immensely comfort even though mercer do not make much sense out of it thus event occur and victim change in appearance and new one arrive sometimes bdikkat take the new one rest in the everlasting sleep of they burned-out brain in a ground-truck to be add to other herd the body in the truck thresh and bawl without human speech when the dromozoa strike they finally mercer do manage to follow bdikkat to the door of the cabin he have to fight the bliss of super-condamine to do it only the memory of previous hurt bewilderment and perplexity make he sure that if he do not ask bdikkat when he mercer be happy the answer would no long be available when he need it fight pleasure itself he beg bdikkat to check the record and to tell he how long he have be there bdikkat grudgingly agree but he do not come out of the doorway he speak through the public address box build into the cabin and he gigantic voice roar out over the empty plain so that the pink herd of talk people stir gently in they happiness and wonder what they friend bdikkat might be want to tell they when he say it they think it exceedingly profound though none of they understand it since it be simply the amount of time that mercer have be on shayol standard year eighty-four year seven month three day two hour eleven and one half minute good luck fellow mercer turn away the secret little corner of he mind which stay sane through happiness and pain make he wonder about bdikkat what persuade the cow-man to remain on shayol what keep he happy without super-condamine be bdikkat a crazy slave to he own duty or be he a man who have hope of go back to he own planet some day surround by a family of little cow-people resemble himself mercer despite he happiness weep a little at the strange fate of bdikkat he own fate he accept he remember the last time he have eat actual egg from an actual pan the dromozoa keep he alive but he do not know how they do it he stagger back to the group the lady da naked in the dusty plain wave a hospitable hand and show that there be a place for he to sit beside she there be unclaimed square mile of seat space around they but he appreciate the kindliness of she gesture none the less 4 the year if they be year go by the land of shayol do not change sometimes the bubble sound of geyser come faintly across the plain to the herd of man those who could talk declare it to be the breathe of captain alvarez there be night and day but no set of crop no change of season no generation of man time stand still for these people and they load of pleasure be so commingle with the shock and pain of the dromozoa that the word of the lady da take on very remote mean people never live forever she statement be a hope not a truth in which they could believe they do not have the wit to follow the star in they course to exchange name with each other to harvest the experience of each for the wisdom of all there be no dream of escape for these people though they see the old-style chemical rocket lift up from the field beyond bdikkats cabin they do not make plan to hide among the freeze crop of transmute flesh far long ago some other prisoner than one of these have try to write a letter he handwriting be on a rock mercer read it and so have a few of the other but they could not tell which man have do it nor do they care the letter scrape on stone have be a message home they could still read the open once i be like you step out of i window at the end of day and let the wind blow i gently toward the place i live in once like you i have one head two hand ten finger on i hand the front part of i head be call a face and i could talk with it now i can only write and that only when i get out of pain
