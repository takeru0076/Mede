thus the three main category of antisubmarine warfare operation be defense of ship defense of naval force and area defense the last category overlap the other in amphibious operation and near terminal and base to effect these operation five element exist 1 surface 2 air 3 mine 4 submarine and 5 fix installation surface force have be use to provide defense zone around naval and merchant ship formation air to furnish area surveillance and mine for protection of limit area submarine and shore installation be new element the submarine now have a definite place in submarine defense particularly in deny enemy access to ocean area fix installation offer possibility for area detection i warfare be be reorient against submarine target a sixth element not always consider be intelligence it include operational intelligence of the enemy and knowledge of the environment operational intelligence presumably will be available from we national intelligence agency intelligence on the environment will come from the recently augment program in oceanography the major postwar development be the certainty that these element should not be consider singly but in combination and a be mutually support necessity for an over-all concept think on submarine defense have not always be clear-cut proponent of single element tend to ensure predominance of that element without determine if it be justify and the element with the most enthusiastic and vociferous proponent have assume the great importance consequently air surface and submarine element overshadow the i fix installation and intelligence these have seek more and more of what they have each seem to strive for elimination of the necessity for the other this despite postwar experience demonstrate that all element be necessarily mutually support thus the most productive area be not necessarily the most stress this be state to emphasize the necessity for an over-all concept of submarine defense one which would provide position of relative importance to asw element base on project potentiality then the enthusiasm and energy of all element can be channele to produce cumulative progress toward a common objective an over-all concept would have other advantage it would allow presentation to the public of a unify approach now the problem be present piecemeal and sometimes contradictorily while one element be announce progress another be delineating it problem the result can only be confusion in the public mind a unify concept can serve a a guide to budgeting and if public support be gain will command congressional support industry s main criticism of the navy s antisubmarine effort be that it can not determine where any one company or industry can apply it skill and know-how lack guidance industry pick it own area the result couple with the salesmanship for which american industry be famous be considerable expenditure of fund and effort in marginal area an over-all concept will guide industry where available talent and facility will yield great dividend therefore a broad concept of over-all submarine defense be need for co-ordination of the navy s effort for a logical presentation to the public for industry s guidance and a a basis for a program to the congress principle involve in an over-all concept that which follow will be a discussion of principle and possible content for an over-all concept of antisubmarine warfare russia possess the preponderance of submarine in the world divide between she various fleet some be also in albania and other be on loan to egypt other country which may willingly or unwillingly become communist can furnish base communist target area can be assume but there be no certainty that such assumption coincide with soviet intention attack can come from almost any direction against many location logically then the first principle of the plan must be that it be not rigidly orient toward any geographical area it be often state that the submarine can be destroy while build at base in transit and on station destruction of the enemy s build and base complex however require attack on enemy territory which be possible only in event of all-out hostility in transit or on station it may not be possible to attack the submarine until commission of an overt act the communist be adept at utilize hostility short of general war and will do so whenever it be to they advantage therefore the second principle of the plan must be that while provide for all-out hostility it effectiveness be not dependent on general war antisubmarine warfare do not involve clash between large oppose force with the decision a result of a single battle it be a war of attrition of single action of an exchange of loss this exchange must result in we end up with some effective unit initially have fewer unit of some element especially submarine than the opponent we capability need to be sufficiently great than theirs so that the exchange will be in we favor therefore the third principle of the plan must be that it do not depend for effectiveness on engagement by the same type unless at an assure favorable exchange rate the submarine have increase it effectiveness by several order of magnitude since world war 2 it speed have increase it operate at increasingly great depth it submerge endurance be become unlimited and it will become even more silent the next development will probably be in weaponry the missile can gradually be expect to replace the torpedo a detection range increase weapon will be develop to attack other submarine and surface craft at these range therefore the fourth principle of the plan must be that it provide for continuously increase capability in the opponent no element can accomplish the total objective of submarine defense some element support the other but all have limitation some limitation of one element can be compensate for by a capability of another element use in combination will increase the over-all capability more than the sum of the capability of the individual element therefore the plan s fifth principle must be that it capitalize on the capability of all element in combination conceivably the submarine defense problem can be solve by sufficient force number would be astronomical and current fiscal policy make this an impractical solution shipbuilding aircraft procurement and weapon program indicate that there will not be enough of anything therefore any measure take in peacetime which will decrease force requirement in war will contribute greatly to success when hostility occur therefore the sixth principle of the plan must be that it concentrate on current measure which will reduce future force requirement the world be constantly change what be new yesterday be obsolescent today the seventh principle of the plan be self-evident it must be flexible enough to allow for technological breakthrough scientific progress and change in world condition support element in asw operation to this point the need for an over-all plan for submarine defense have be demonstrate the mission have be state broad principle delineating it content lay down and the support element list before consider these element in more detail an additional requirement should be state large area coverage will accomplish all other task therefore because reduction in task result in reduction of force require the plan should provide for expand area coverage but it must be remember that the plan should not be orient geographically consequently the system give area coverage if such coverage be less than world wide must be flexible and hence at least partially mobile since effective area coverage appear fairly remote the requirement can be bear in mind while consider the element air surface sub-surface fix installation mine and intelligence these be arrange approximately in the order of the vociferousness of they proponent but will be discuss in the reverse order in the hope that the true order of importance will result intelligence a use herein will include information on possible opponent and on the environment which can affect operation these can be refer to a operational intelligence and environmental intelligence in submarine defense these must have maximum stress good operational intelligence can ensure sound plan greatly reduce force requirement and increase tactical effectiveness environmental intelligence be just a important the ocean presently co-operate with the target full knowledge of the science of oceanography can bring the environment to we side result in an increase in effectiveness of equipment and tactic a decrease in enemy capability and the development of method of capitalize on the environment therefore improve intelligence will result in reduce force requirement and a it support all other element rate a top priority gather intelligence be important but of equal importance be it translation into usable form a program be need to translate the result of oceanographic research into tactical and operate instruction approach this problem on a statistical basis be invalid because the opponent have the same source available and will be encounter not under average condition but under the condition most advantageous to he therefore the on-the-scene commander must have detail operate instruction base on measurement of condition in the area at the time of encounter all capability must be use to maximum advantage then temperature wind oxygen content depth bottom character and animal life be the chief environmental variable there may be other variation in sound velocity should be measure rather than temperature because more of the variable would be encompass these variation must eventually be measure horizontally a well a vertically progress in predict water condition be encourage but little guidance be available to the man at sea on the use of such information a concurrent effort be need to make oceanographic data useful on the spot i warfare have in the past be direct against surface target by it nature it have always be of great psychological advantage and small effort have require considerably great counter-efforts mine be be increasingly orient against submarine target they be still consider to be for use in restrict water however and target must come within a few yard of they mine need to be recognize a a major element in anti-submarine warfare employment extend to deep water and have they effective area per unit increase mine can be use to deny access to great area they be difficult to counter cost little to maintain until require and can be put into place quickly a most attractive feature be that detection and attack be combine in a single package effective employment will reduce force requirement for example effective i barrier from florida to cuba and across the yucatan channel from cuba to mexico would remove all requirement for harbor defense inshore patrol convoy escort ship control and i defense for the entire gulf of mexico more extend system cover all passage into the caribbean would free the caribbean and the gulf of mexico from the previously list requirement system cover the gulf of st lawrence and possibly the entire coast of the unite state be not impossible such i defense system could permit concentration of mobile force in the open ocean with consequent increase in the probability of success the advantage inherent in i warfare justify a great an importance for this element a be accord any of the other element fix installation be increasingly advocate a the problem of area defense emerge the proponent be scientific and technical man who exercise considerable influence on they military counterpart system which detect submarine over wide area be attractive although they can be only burglar alarm mobile force be require to localize and attack detect target since the system be not capable of pinpoint a target such system be expensive and be orient geographically in an over-all asw concept dependence on and effort expend for such system should be limit to those with prove capability no general installation should be make until a model installation have be prove and it maximum capability determine in addition proposal for fix installation should be carefully weigh against a counterpart mobile system fix installation will always lack the flexibility that should be inherent in naval system the submarine have become increasingly attractive a an antisubmarine weapon system it operate in it target s environment and any advantage gain therefrom by the target be share by the attacker but the submarine be a weapon of ambush and therefore always in danger of be ambush
