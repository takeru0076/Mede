a tribe in ancient india believe the earth be a huge tea tray rest on the back of three giant elephant which in turn stand on the shell of a great tortoise this theory eventually prove inexact but the primitive method of explain the unknown with what be know bear at least a symbolic resemblance to the method of modern science it be the business of cosmologist the scientist who study the nature and structure of the universe to try to solve the great cosmic mystery by use key that have click open other door these key be the work principle of physics mathematics and astronomy principle which be then extrapolate or project to explain phenomenon of which we have little or no direct knowledge in the autumn of 1959 the british broadcast corporation present a series of talk by four scientist competent in cosmology three of these man discuss major theory of the universe while the other act a a moderator the participant be professor h bondi professor of mathematics at king s college london dr wb bonnor reader in mathematics at queen elizabeth college london dr r a lyttleton a lecturer at st john s college cambridge and a reader in theoretical astronomy at the university of cambridge and dr gj whitrow reader in apply mathematics at the imperial college of science and technology london dr whitrow function a moderator the program be so well receive by the british public that the argument have be publish in a totally engross little book call rival theory of cosmology dr bonnor begin with a discussion of the relativistic theory of the universe base on the general theory of relativity first of all and this have be calculate by observation the universe be expand that be the galaxy be recede from each other at immense speed because of this dr bonnor hold that the universe be become more thinly populate by star and whatever else be there this expansion have be go on for an estimate eight billion year expand and contract dr bonnor support the idea that the universe both expand and contract that in several billion year the expansion will slow up and reverse itself and that the contraction will set in then after many more billions of year when all the galaxy be whistle toward a common center this movement will slow down and reverse itself again professor bondi disagree with the expansion-contraction theory he support the steady-state theory which hold that matter be continually be create in space for this reason he say the density of the universe always remain the same even though the galaxy be zoom away in all direction new galaxy be forever be form to fill in the gap leave by the recede galaxy if this be true then the universe today look just a it do millions of year ago and a it will look millions of year hence even though the universe be expand for new galaxy to be create professor bondi declare it would only be necessary for a single hydrogen atom to be create in an area the size of you live room once every few million year he contend this idea do nt conflict with experiment on which the principle of conservation of matter and energy be base because some slight error must be assume in such experiment dr lyttleton back the theory that we live in an electric universe and this theory start with the behavior of proton and electron proton and electron bear opposite electrical charge which make they attract each other and when they be join they make up an atom of hydrogen the basic build block of matter the charge of the electron and proton be believe to be exactly equal and opposite but dr lyttleton be not so sure suppose say dr lyttleton the proton have a slightly great charge than the electron so slight it be presently immeasurable this would give the hydrogen atom a slight charge-excess now if one hydrogen atom be place at the surface of a large sphere of hydrogen atom it would be subject both to the gravitation of the sphere and the charge-excess of all those atom in the sphere because electrical force the charge-excess be far more powerful than gravitation the surface hydrogen atom would shoot away from the sphere dr lyttleton then imagine the universe a a large hydrogen sphere with surface atom shoot away from it this he claim would reasonably account for the expansion of the universe fleet glimpse this slim book while give the reader only a fleet glimpse of the scientific mind confront the universe have the appeal that inform conversation always have several photograph and chart of galaxy help the non-scientist keep up with the discussion and the smooth language indicate the contributor be determine to avoid the jargon that seem to work it way into almost every field it be clear from this discussion that cosmologist of every persuasion look hopefully toward the day when a man-made satellite can be equip with optical device which will open up new vista to science presently the intense absorption of ultra-violet ray in the earth s atmosphere seriously hinder ground observation these scientist be convince that a telescope unclouded by the earth s gas will go a long way toward bolster or destroy cosmic theory there would seem to be some small solace in the prospect that the missile race between nation be at the same time accelerate the study of the space around we give we a long-sought ladder from which to peer at alien region in do away with the tea tray the elephant and the giant tortoise science have develop a series of rationally defensible explanation of the cosmos and although the universe may forever defy understand it might even now be find it match in the imagination of man root the new play at the brand-new mayfair theater on 46th st which have be make over from a night club be about the intellectual and spiritual awaken of an english farm girl highly successful in england before it transfer to new york most of root be a relentlessly dour a the trapping of the small new theater be gaudy only in it final scene where beatie bryant mary doyle shake off the disappointment of be jilt by she intellectual lover and proclaim she emancipation do we get much which make worthwhile the series of boorish rustic happening we have have to watch for most of the first two and one-half act the burden of mr wesker s message be that people live close to the soil at least in england be not the happy fine strong natural earthy people city-bred intellectual imagine rather they be genuine clod proud of they cloddishness and openly antagonistic to the illuminate influence of aesthetics or think they care no more for politics say mr wesker than they do for a symphony seem to have root in the soil they actually have none in life they dwell in short in the doltish twilight in which peasant and serf of the past be commonly report to have live but this be a theme which do not take so much time to state a mr wesker dedicate to it so much untidiness of mind and household do not attract the interest of the theatergoer unless he have be live in a gild palace perhaps and want a real big heap of contrast the messy meal the wash of dish the dry of clothe may be realism but there be such a thing a redundancy now for the good point miss doyle a beatie have a great fund of animal spirit a strong voice and a warm smile she be just home from a sojourn in london where she have become the sweetheart of a young fellow name ronnie we never do see he and have be subject to a first course in think and appreciate include a dose of good british socialism but while she be able to tell she retard family about the new world she have see open before she ronnie have not be able to observe she progress and instead of appear at a family party to be look over like a new bull he send beatie a letter of dismissal beatie get no sympathy for she misfortune soon rally and find that although she have lose a lover she have gain she freedom despite a too long sustain declamatory flight this final speech be convince and we see why british audience apparently be impress by root there be several fairly good minor portrait in the play include william hansen s impersonation of a stubborn rather pathetic father and katherine squire s vigorous characterization of a farm mother who brook no hifalutin nonsense from she daughter or anyone else but i be afraid mr wesker s meat and potato dish be nt well season enough for local audience shakespeare have a word for everything even for the rain that disrupt wednesday night s much ado about nothing open the season of free theatre in central park the new york shakespeare festival which be use the wollman memorial skate rink while it theatre near the belvedere be be complete begin bravely joseph papp impassioned founder of the festival and director of much ado have a vibrant colorful production under way use a wide stage resourcefully he mingle music and dance with shakespeare s word in a spirit mixture the audience fill all the seat inside the wollman enclosure and overflow onto the lawn outside the fence the barbed sally of beatrice and benedick so contemporary to a public inure to the humor of insult raise chuckle the simple-minded comedy of dogberry and verge also familiar in a day that respond easily to joke skim off the top of writer head evoke laughter the vivacity of the masquer party at leonato s palace with the spanish motif in the music and dance in honor of the visit prince of arragon cast a spell of delight a much ado turn serious while the insipid claudio reject hero at the altar a sprinkle begin to fall at first hardly a person in the audience move although some umbrella be open but the rain come more heavily and man and woman in light summer clothe begin to depart the grieve hero and she father leonato follow by the friar leave the stage a voice on the loudspeaker system announce that if the rain let up the performance would resume in ten minute more than half the audience depart some remain in the wollman enclosure fortify with raincoat or with newspaper to cover they head other huddle under the tree outside the fence twenty minute after the interruption although it be still rain the play be resume at the point in the fourth act where it have be stop beatrice nan martin and benedick jd cannon take they place on the stage in they very first speech it be clear that shakespeare like a nostradamus have foresee this moment say benedick lady beatrice have you weep all this while reply beatrice yea and i will weep a while long the heaven refuse to give up they weep the gallant company complete act 4 and get through part of act 5 but the final scene could not be play if any among the hardy hundreds who sit in the downpour be in doubt about how it come out let they take comfort much ado end happily the park department have do an admirable job of prepare the wollman rink for shakespeare one could hardly blame newbold morris the park commissioner for devote so much grateful mention to the department s technician who at short notice provide the stage with it rise platform it balcony it generous wing and even it impressive trapdoor for the use of the villain eldon elder who design the stage also create a gay spacious set that blend attractively with the park background and shakespeare s lightheart mood mr papp have direct a performance that have verve and pace although he have tolerate obvious business to garner easy laugh where elegance and consistency of style would be preferable
