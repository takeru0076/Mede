the popularity of folklore in america stand in direct proportion to the popularity of nationalism in america and the emphasis on nationalism in america be in proportion to the growth of american influence across the world thus if we be to observe american folklore in the twentieth century we will do well to establish the relationship between folklore nationalism and imperialism at the outset historian have come to recognize two cardinal fact concern nationalism and international influence 1 every age rewrite the event of it history in term of what should have be create legend about itself that rationalize contemporary belief and excuse contemporary action what actually occur in the past be seldom a important a what a give generation feel must have occur 2 a a country superimpose it cultural and political attitude on other it search it heritage in hope of justify it aggressiveness it folklore and legend usually disguise a history be allow to account for group action to provide a focal point for group loyalty and to become a cohesive force for national identification one can apply these fact to britain in the late eighteenth and nineteenth century a she spread she dominion over palm and pine and they can be apply again to the unite state in more recent year the popularity of local color literature before the spanish-american war the steady currency of the lincoln myth the increase emphasis on the frontier west in we mass media be case in point nor be it an accident that baseball grow into the national game in the last 75 year have become a microcosm of american life that learn society such a the american folklore society and the american historical association be found in the 1880s or that course in american literature american civilization american anything have sweep we school and college curriculum of course nationalism have really outlive it usefulness in a country a world-oriented a ours and it continue existence reflect one of the major culture lag of the twentieth-century unite state yet nationalism have lose few of it charm for the historian writer or man in the street it be an understandable paradox that most american history and most american literature be today write from an essentially egocentric and isolationistic point of view at the very time america be spread she dominion over palm and pine after all the average american a he lie and wait for the enemy in korea or a she scan the newspaper in some vain hope of personal contact with the front be unconcerned that he or she plight be the result of a complex of personal economic and governmental action far beyond the normal citizen s comprehension and control anyone s identification with an international struggle whether warlike or peaceful require absurd oversimplification and intense emotional involvement such identification come for each group in each crisis by rewriting history into legend and develop appropriate national hero in america such self-deception have serve a particularly useful purpose a heterogeneous people have need it to attain an element of cultural and political cohesion in a new and ever-changing land but we must never forget most of the appropriate hero and they legend be create overnight to answer immediate need almost always with conscious aim and end parson weems s george washington become the symbol of honesty and the father image of the unite state abraham lincoln emerge a an incarnation of the national constitution robert e lee represent the dignity need by a rebel confederacy and they role be paralleled by those of patrick henry nathan hale andrew jackson davy crockett theodore roosevelt and many many more therefore the scholar a he look at we national folklore of the last 60 year will be mindful of two fact 1 most of the legend that be create to fan the fire of patriotism be essentially propagandistic and be not folk legend at all 2 the concept that an american national folklore exist be itself probably another propagandistic legend folklore be individually create art that a homogeneous group of people preserve vary and recreate through oral transmission it have come to mean myth legend tale song proverb riddle superstition rhyme and such literary form of expression relate to write literature and often remain temporarily freeze in write form it lose it vitality when transcribe or remove from it oral existence though it may exist in either literate or illiterate society it assume a role of true cultural importance only in the latter in it propagandistic and commercial haste to discover we folk heritage the public have remain ignorant of definition such a this enthusiastically american have sweep subliterary and bogus material like paul bunyan tale abe lincoln anecdote and labor union song up a true product of we american oral tradition nor have we remember that in the melt pot of america the hundreds of isolate and semi-isolated ethnic regional and occupational group do not fuse into a homogeneous national unit until long after education and industrialization have cause they to cast oral tradition aside a a mean of carry culturally significant material naturally such scholarly fact be of little concern to the man try to make money or fan patriotism by mean of folklore that much of what he call folklore be the result of belief carefully sow among the people with the conscious aim of produce a desire mass emotional reaction to a particular situation or set of situation be irrelevant a long a he material be americana can in some way be ascribe to the mass and appear democratic to he audience he remain satisfy from all this we can now see that two stream of development run through the history of twentieth-century american folklore on the one side we have the university professor and they student train in teutonic method of research who have seek out collect and study the true product of the oral tradition of the ethnic regional and occupational group that make up this nation on the other we have the flag-wavers and the national sentimentalist who have be will to use any patriotic frontier western or colonial material willy-nilly unfortunately few of the artist writer movie producer dramatist and musician who have use american folklore since 1900 have know enough to distinguish between the two stream even in the most general of way after all the field be large difficult to define and seldom teach properly to american undergraduate in addition this country have be settle by many people of many heritage and they lore have become acculturated slowly in an age of print and easy communication within an ever-expanding and change society the problem confuse even the expert for that matter the expert themselves be a mix breed anthropologist housewife historian and such by profession they approach they discipline a amateur collector commercial propagandist analyst or some combination of the four they have widely vary background and aim they have little esprit de corps the outlook for the amateur for instance be usually dependent on he fondness for local history or for the picturesque he love of folklore have romanticism in it and he do nt care much about the dollar-sign or the footnote folklore be he hobby and he all too rightly wish it to remain a such the amateur be closely relate to the collector who be actually no more than the amateur who have take to the field the collector enjoy the contact with rural life he hunt folklore for the very field and stream reason that many person hunt game and only rarely be he acutely concern with the mean of what he have locate fundamentally both these type the amateur and the collector be uncritical and many of they do nt distinguish well between real folklore and bogus material but there be also the commercial propagandist and the analyst one dominate by money the other by nineteenth-century german scholarship both be primarily concern with the use that can be make of the material that the collector have find both shudder at the think of proceed too far beyond the sewage system and the electric light line the commercial propagandist who can nt afford to be critical get along well with the amateur from whom he feed but he frequently step on the analyst s toe by refuse to keep he material genuine he standard be of course completely foreign to those of the analyst to both the amateur and the commercial progandist the analyst lack a soul lack appreciation with he endless probing and classification dominate by the vicious circle of the university promotion system the analyst look down on and get along poorly with the other three group although he can not deny he debt to the collector the knowledge that most american have of folklore come through contact with commercial propagandist and a few energetic amateur and collector the work do by the analyst the man who really know what folklore be all about have no more appeal than any other work of a truly scientific sort and reach a limit learn audience publisher want book that will sell record studio want disc that will not seem strange to ear use to hillbilly and jazz music grade and high school want quaint but moral material the analyst be apt to be too honest to fit in a a result most people do nt have more than a vague idea what folklore actually be they see it a a potpourri of charm moral legend and patriotic anecdote with a superstition or remedy throw in here and there and so well be such ignorance preserve by the amateur and the money-maker that even at the college level most of the hundred-odd folklore course give in the unite state survive on sentiment and nationalism alone if one wish to discuss a literary figure who use folklore in he work the first thing he must realize be that the literary figure be probably part of this ignorant american public and while every writer must be deal with a a special case the interest student will want to ask himself a number of question about each do the writer know the difference between an ersatz ballad or tall tale and a true product of the folk when the writer use material do he tamper with it to improve it commercial effect or do he leave it pure be the writer propagandistic be he sweep away by sentiment and nostalgia for an america that be or do he sincerely want to tap the real spring of american attitude and culture regardless of how unpopular and embarrass they may be when he get the answer to he question he will be discourage in the first place a good many writer who be say to use folklore do not unless one count an occasional superstition or tale robert frost for instance write about rural life in new england but he do not include any significant amount of folklore in he poem this have not however prevent publisher from label he a folk poet simply because he be a rural one in the second place a large number of writer make a more direct claim than frost to be folk writer of one sort or another clearly make no distinction between genuine and bogus material stephen vincent benet s john brown s body come immediately to mind in this connection a do john steinbeck s the grape of wrath and carl sandburg s the people yes the last two writer introduce strong political bias into they work and not unlike the union leader that we will discuss soon see folklore a a reservoir of protest by a downtrodden and publically silence mass folklore a use by such writer really reflect image engrave into it by the very person use it the folk be simply not homogeneous with respect to nation or political attitude in fact there be much evidence to indicate they do nt care a bit about anything beyond they particular regional ethnic and occupational limit nevertheless with a read public that long for the good old day and with an awareness of we expand international interest it be easy for the benets to obtain a magnify position in literature by use of all sort of americana real or fake and it be easy for the steinbecks and sandburgs to support they message of reform by read message of reform into the mind of the folk
