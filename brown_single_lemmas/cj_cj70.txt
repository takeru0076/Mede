in the midwest oxidation pond be use extensively for the treatment of domestic sewage from suburban area the high cost of land and a few operational problem result from excessive loading have create the need for a wastewater treatment system with the operational characteristic of the oxidation pond but with the ability to treat more organic matter per unit volume research at fayette missouri on oxidation pond have show that the bod in the treat effluent vary from 30 to 53 mg with loading from 8 to 120 lb since experience indicate that effluent from oxidation pond do not create major problem at these bod concentration the goal for the effluent quality of the accelerate treatment system be the same a from conventional oxidation pond recent study by weston and stack have indicate that a turbine aerator could be add to an oxidation pond to increase the rate of oxygen transfer they study show that it be possible to transfer 3 to 4 lb of oxygen hr hp oconnor and eckenfelder discuss the use of aerate lagoon for treat organic waste they indicate that a 4-day retention aerate lagoon would give 60 to 76 per cent bod reduction late eckenfelder increase the efficiency of treatment to between 75 and 85 per cent in the summer month it appear from the limit information available that the aerate lagoon might offer a satisfactory mean of increase the capacity of exist oxidation pond a well a provide the same degree of treatment in a small volume red bridge subdivision with the development of the red bridge subdivision south of kansas city missouri the developer be face with the problem of provide adequate sewage disposal the sewage system from kansas city be not expect to serve the red bridge area for several year this necessitate the construction of temporary sewage treatment facility with an expect life from 5 to 15 afj for the initial development an oxidation pond be construct a show in figure 1 the oxidation pond have a surface area of 477 acre and a depth of 4 afj the pond be currently serve 1230 person or 260 person per acre in the summer of 1960 the oxidation pond become completely septic and emit obnoxious odor it be possible to maintain aerobic condition in the pond by regular addition of sodium nitrate until the temperature decrease and the alga population change from blue-green to green alga the anaerobic condition in the exist oxidation pond necessitate examination of other method for supply additional oxygen than by sodium nitrate at the same time far expansion in the red bridge subdivision require the construction of additional sewage treatment facility the large land area require for oxidation pond make this type of treatment financially unattractive to the developer it be propose that aerate lagoon be use to eliminate the problem at the exist oxidation pond and to provide the necessary treatment for the additional development pilot lagoon the lack of adequate data on the aerate lagoon system prompt the developer to construct an aerate lagoon pilot plant to determine it feasibility for treat domestic sewage the pilot plant be a circular lagoon 81 ft in diam at the surface and 65 ft in diam at the bottom 4 ft below the surface with a volume of 121000 afj the side slope be coat with fiberglas mat coat with asphalt to prevent erosion the pilot lagoon be locate a show in figure 1 to serve the area just south of the exist house area the major contributor be a shop center with house be add to the system a the subdivision develop the pilot lagoon be design to handle the waste from 314 person with a 4-day aeration period initially the wastewater would be entirely from the shop center with the domestic sewage from the house increase over an 18-month period this operation would permit evaluation of the pilot plant with a slowly increase load over a reasonable period of time the pilot plant be equip with a 3-hp turbine aerator figure 2 the aerator have a variable-speed drive to permit operation through a range of speed the sewage flow into the treatment plant be meter and continuously record on 24-hr chart the raw sewage be introduce directly under the turbine aerator to insure maximum mix of the raw sewage with the aeration tank content the effluent be collect through two pipe and discharge to the blue river through a surface drainage ditch analysis composite sample be collect at weekly interval the long retention period and the complete mix concept prevent rapid change in either the mix liquor or in the effluent weekly sample would make any change more readily discernible than daily sample the composite sample be normally collect over a 6-hr period but an occasional 24-hr composite be make examination of the operation of the shop center permit correlation of the 6-hr composite sample with 24-hr operation the data indicate that the organic load during the 6-hr composite be essentially 50 per cent of the 24-hr organic load grab sample be collect from the exist oxidation pond to determine it operate condition effort be make to take the grab sample at random period so that the mass of data could be treat a a 6-hr composite sample a single 24-hr composite sample indicate that the sewage flow pattern and characteristic be typical pilot plant operation the bod of the influent to the pilot plant vary between 110 and 710 mg with an average of 350 afj this be equivalent to 240 mg on a 24-hr basis the bod of the raw sewage be typical of domestic sewage from a subdivision the bod in the effluent average 58 mg a 76-per-cent reduction over the 24-hr period examination of the data in table 1 show that a few sample contribute to raise the effluent afj the period of high effluent bod occur during cold period when operational problem with the aerator result ice cause the aerator to overload strain the drive belt the slippage of the drive belt cause the aerator to slow down and reduce oxygen transfer a well a the mix of the raw sewage the organic load on the unit average 32 lb of bod or about 2 lb bod1000 cu ft aeration capacity needless to say the organic load be very low on a volumetric basis but be 270 lb bod on a surface load basis it seem that the aerate lagoon be a very heavily load oxidation pond or a lightly load activate sludge system the flow rate remain relatively constant during the winter month a show in table 1 with the spring rain the flow rise rapidly due to infiltration in open sewer a construction progress the volume of storm drainage will be sharply reduce the retention period in the aerate lagoon range from 98 to 26 day average 64 day the large amount of vegetable grinding from the grocery store in the shop center create a suspend solid problem the vegetable be not readily metabolize by the bacterium in the aeration unit and tend to float on the surface a skim device at the effluent weir prevent loss of most of these light solid the average volatile suspend solid in the effluent be 75 mg while mlss average 170 mg volatile suspend solid the average sludge age base on displacement of solid be calculate to be 145 day the oxygen uptake rate in the mix liquor average 08 mg during the first four month of this study variation in aerator speed during the latter two month of this study cause increase mix and increase oxygen demand the increase in oxygen uptake rate from 12 to 26 mg which follow an increase in rotor speed be believe to be relate to resuspension of solid which have settle at the low rotor speed it appear that most of the mix liquor suspend solid be active microbial solid with the heavy less active solid settle out the suspend solid discharge in the effluent be find to be the major source of the afj removal of the suspend solid by a membrane filter yield an average effluent contain only 20 mg afj the bod in the drainage ditch receive the pilot plant effluent average 12 afj this low bod be due to removal of the excess suspend solid by sedimentation since the only dilution be surface runoff which be very low during this study microscopic examination routine microscopic examination be make of the mix liquor a indicate by mckinney and gram for the various type of protozoa it be find that the aerate lagoon be an activate sludge system rather than an oxidation pond at no time be alga find in the mix liquor the bacterium form typical activate sludge floc the floc particle be all small a the heavy floc settle out initially the flagellate protozoa predominate but they soon give way to the free swim ciliated protozoa a the temperature decrease the number of free swim ciliated protozoa decrease very little protozoa activity exist below 40-degrees-f when the temperature reach 32-degrees-f all protozoan activity cease but a the temperature rise the number of protozoa increase rapidly only once be stalk ciliates find in the mix liquor the predomination of free swim ciliated protozoa be indicative of a high bacterial population oxygen transfer one of the important aspect of this study be to determine the oxygen transfer relationship of the mechanical aerator routine determination be make for dissolve oxygen in the mix liquor and for oxygen uptake rate the data give in table 2 show the routine operation of the aerator the dissolve oxygen in the aeration unit be consistently high until january 29 1961 an extend cold spell cause ice to build up on the aerator which be mount on a float platform and cause the entire platform to sink low in the water the add resistance to the rotor damage the drive belt and reduce the oxygen transfer capacity it be approximately one month before the belt problem be notice and correct but at no time be there a deficiency of dissolve oxygen a series of eight special test be conduct at different rotor speed to determine the oxygen transfer rate five of the test be conduct with a polyethylene cover to simulate an ice cover the rate of oxygen transfer at 10-mg l dissolve oxygen concentration and 10-degrees-c for various rotor speed be give in table 3 the maximum rate of oxygen transfer at 10 mg dissolve oxygen be calculate a 220 lb at a maximum rate of 93 afj the actual power requirement indicate 2 lb oxygen transfer hr hp the polyethylene cover reduce the oxygen transfer rate by 10 per cent indicate that the maximum oxygen transfer be at the rotor rather than through the surface oxidation pond during this study septic condition develop in the oxidation pond in the spring when the ice melt shortly after this study end septic condition result which require the addition of sodium nitrate the location of the oxidation pond in a high-value residential area make odor nuisance a sensitive problem for the developer the organic concentration in the influent raw sewage range from 160 to 270 mg of bod with an average of 230 afj the bod data be give in table 4 a single 24-hr composite sample have a bod of 260 mg indicate a typical domestic sewage the daily sewage volume to the oxidation pond average 147000 gpd give a retention period of 42 day the organic load on the pond be slightly under 60 lb bod day acre the effluent bod average 34 mg a little low than that of the study at fayette indicate for a load of 60 lb afj the bod of the effluent range from a minimum of 13 to a maximum of 47 mg l microscopic examination of the effluent show that minimum bod occur when the alga begin to decrease with cold weather when the alga begin to build up again the effluent bod rise during the two week when the alga disappear from the effluent bod s in the effluent be 18 and 16 afj
