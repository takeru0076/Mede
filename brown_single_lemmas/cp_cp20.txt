fantastic pressure deep in she body squeeze not i but the air i breathe into a nitrogen anesthetic yielding-mediterranian-woman - she soothe i and draw i deep into she i no long know how deep i be somewhere under 230 foot get drunk happy and more content by the second the reason for this dive seem foolish now only the dive itself have any mean the metal-tasting nitrogen make i wonder if i should remove the mouthpiece and suck in the sweet water perhaps if i take off the aqua-lung i could swim good love i woman good i chuckle aloud and the mouthpiece fall out while a hazy part of i mind concentrate on swim down a clear part sort over recent event among they i only positive act in a long time it be when i pack up what dud i have and go to paris it be no vacation just i get out after a

feel another of terrible urgency be you even free madame i say with noblesse oblige because of the handsome yeah and so off we go to she apartment she be a nymphomaniac of course the poor girl toward the break of day i wax philosophical and draw analogy about she way of eat bread and cheese now it be nine year late and it be nt spring but winter when i return i get there on a saturday even i make the mistake of go to the jour et nuit the place be busy but i do nt feel like a hun i sit wait for life to come along and sweep i up i have part of a bottle of french beer call panther pil so help i

turn over the idea of a good debauchery when i doze off i feel good tuesday even when i wake up i head be clear i think sober and i be reconcile to this paris idea a a flop on top of all i other a good binge have that kind of therapeutic value sometime early the weather have turn cold and it be snow i go out into it i walk around breathe the cold wine of the air until i find a park and i sit down on a snowy bench where the light be dim and come from the sky there be dignity and beauty in the little white flake fall through the blue night i have on only a topcoat but i be nt cold i be just miserable pretty soon a woman come along carry a fold umbrella a a walk stick she see i and sit down beside i three foot away suddenly i understand why she have the umbrella it give she poise and posture without it she would have be drab and limp it give she propriety it give she the right to sit down beside i back straight one hand out on the handle i could nt imagine she without it i know all about she she be another human be and happen to be a hustler i do nt much care if she be there or not after a while she say with sort of an unuttered laugh you have snow in you hair and ear i do nt have on a hat hardly glance at she i smile a bleak one which say thank baby but i d rather be alone she be silent for a while then say why be you so unhappy i m not unhappy i lie stare at the snow she be try to make a hole in i armor and i do nt want it be it a woman she ask gently she must have see the ring on i leave hand well woman and unhappiness go together i observe profoundly add you can wager you derriere on that ah monsieur it be not i business to wager it this take i so funny i have to look at she i feel i freeze sad face crumble and i grin a silly one i could nt have help i even snort a chuckle she smile at i but it be an awfully sad smile she be even more miserable than i she eye be smile too but so sadly and there be tiredness and infinite wisdom in they now be nt it good to smile she ask because i like this sad person so much i say will you have a drink with i i could see the ancient cynicism reinforce itself in she eye and i wonder how many man she have pick up with this same gambit anyway i pull a bottle of remy martin out of i topcoat draw the cork and pass it to she i could see she be shock i m sorry i have nt get a glass i say non non she say take the bottle not for that be sorry she tilt up and drink and then i drink it s really rotten to drink good cognac like that but i have nt care before i be nt go to lug around a glass there be nt much light in the blue dark but i could see she well no child this tart she must have be thirty-five or even forty i could nt be sure somehow she be attractive not good look but self-confident and wise so that it make she attractive i like she and all at once i be glad she be there we finish the bottle i have nt have a lot out of it early not speak much to each other and we stay sober i suppose we be cold but we do nt feel it we seem to be drowse sadly soberly in the cold cold air while the snow fall then she say allons and we get up and go to i hotel without another word i sense no strange in she we undress and make love with the comfortable acceptance i have once know with valery i decide thirty-five be the good estimate of she age she have a funny little scar on she stomach on the leave side i think we be very tire for we awake at the same moment deeply rest surprise to see the late morning sun on the window which be wet where the rime have melt i feel wonderful the absolute opposite of last night s melancholy i head be clear i be hungry a a wolf and i body feel lean and vital bon jour i say brightly sit up which pull the cover to she hip she look good with she short tousle hair and no make-up maybe close to thirty i think bon jour she exclaim smile jai faim yeah but breakfast first with a laugh she beat i to the bathroom i call downstairs for food and a toothbrush for she she come out pink from a hot bath and i give she i robe i have brush i tooth shower shave and dress by the time a waiter wheel in breakfast the toothbrush monsieur he say present it i give it to the woman what be this for she ask innocently why to brush you tooth but i already have i use yours oh i say with round eye i wonder if i ought to go use the new one myself but i smell the coffee and think what the hell live dangerously i decide i would scald i worry away the coffee be nt very hot though make in a filter pot but it be good we send the waiter away and eat a tremendous amount of cold ham hot hard-boiled egg and hot garlic bread a we eat we talk she name be suzanne and i stephen we sit back comfortably on the bed with we last cup of coffee you be very tactful do you know stephen she remark um i grunt sip yes because you do nt run off to use that new toothbrush i raise i eye to look at she in the mirror i do nt really use yours she go on i carry one in i purse i know man never kiss les putains to i immense relief she change the subject in the next sentence shall we go to the louvre today all right i say with enthusiasm at the idea but not immediately i put aside i empty cup she smile all the way to she wise sad eye and drain she own we be not rush what be this from i ask touch the scar on she stomach it be like a long thin line draw through a pink circle a bullet she answer the cynicism be back in she eye a bitter wisdom and i wonder if forty be not so far wrong after all she understand sex anyway and play at it well we go to the louvre for a few hour then by metro to a cabaret in montmartre it be a nice place not fill with smoke we have champagne and steam mussel the sommelier bring the wine first a magnum instead of the bottle i have order he must have think i be a tourist i fix he with a steely eye and say what s this for i do nt ask for a jeroboam of champagne i think that be pretty humorous but i do nt laugh
