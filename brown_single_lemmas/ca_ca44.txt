every library borrower or at least those whose taste go beyond the five-cent fiction rental know what it be to hear the librarian say apologetically i m sorry but we do nt have that book there would nt be much demand for it i m afraid behind this reply and it many variation be the ever-present budget problem all library must face from the large to the small what to buy out of the year s grist of nearly 15000 book title what to buy for adult and child reader for lover of fiction and nonfiction for a clientele whose want be incredibly diversify when you budget be pitifully small most library budget be hopelessly inadequate a startlingly high percentage do not exceed $ 500 annually which include the librarian s salary and not even the new york public have enough money to meet it need this in the world s rich city the plight of a small community library be proportionately bad confront with this situation most library either endure the severe limitation of they budget and do what they can with what they have or else depend on the bounty of patron and local government to supplement they annual fund in some part of the country however a co-operative movement have begin to grow under the wing of state government whereby with the financial help of the state library share they book resource on a county-wide or regional basis new york state have what be probably the most advance of these co-operative system so well develop that it have become a model for other to follow because it be so large a state with mark contrast in population density the organization of the new york co-operative offer a cross-section of how the plan work at one extreme be the system of upper new york state where library in two or more county combine to serve a large sparsely populate area at the other be organization like the newly form nassau library system in a high-density area with ample resource and a rapidly grow territory to serve both these type and those in between be in existence by reason of a legislative interest in library that begin at albany a early a 1950 with the creation by the legislature of county library system finance by county government with match fund from the state it be a step in the right direction but it take an additional act pass in 1958 to establish fully the thrive system of today under this law annual grant be give to system in substantial amount an early difficulty be overcome by make it clear that individual library in any area might join or not a they see fit some library board be wary of the plan a large well-stocked library surround in a county by small one may feel that the demand on it resource be likely to be too great a small library may cherish it independence and establish way and resist join in a cooperative movement that sometimes seem radical to old member of the board within a system however the autonomy of each member library be preserve the local community maintain responsibility for the financial support of it own library program facility and service but wide resource and additional service become available through membership in a system all service be give without cost to member so obvious be these advantage that nearly 95 per cent of the population of new york state now have access to a system and enthusiastic librarian foresee the day not too distant when all the library in the state will belong to a co-op to set up a co-operative library system the law require a central book collection of 100000 nonfiction volume a the nucleus and the system be organize around it the collection may be in an exist library or it may be build up in a central collection each system develop differently accord to the area it serve but the universal goal be to pool the resource of a give area for maximum efficiency the basic state grant be thirty cent for each person serve and there be a far book incentive grant that provide an extra twenty cent up to fifty cent per capita if a library spend a certain number of dollar in nassau county for example the heavily settle long island suburb of new york city the system be credit by the state with serve one million person a figure that have double since 1950 this system by virtue of it variety and size offer an inclusive view of the plan in operation the nassau system recognize that it major task it to broaden reference service what with the constant expansion of education and knowledge and the pressure of population growth in a metropolitan area the need be for reference work of a more specialize nature than individual library adequate to satisfy everyday need could afford nassau be currently build a central collection of reference material in it hempstead headquarters which will reach it goal of 100000 volume by 1965 the major part of this collection be in the central headquarters build and the remainder be divide among five library in the system designate a subject center basic reference tool be the backbone of the collection but there

repository of art music and foreign language the reference coordinator at headquarters also serve a a consultant and be available to work with the local librarian in help to strengthen local reference service this kind of cooperation be not wholly new of course public library in nassau county have be lend book to each other by mail for a quarter-century but the system enable this process to operate on an organize and far more comprehensive basis local library find too that the new plan save tax dollar because book can be buy through the system and since the system buy in bulk it be able to obtain large discount than would be available to an individual library the system pass on these saving to it member far money be save through economy in bookkeeping and clerical detail a the result of
