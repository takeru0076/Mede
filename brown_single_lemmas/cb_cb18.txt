for a neutral germany soviet say to fear resurgence of german militarism to the editor of the new york time for the first time in history the entire world be dominate by two large powerful nation arm with murderous nuclear weapon that make conventional warfare of the past a nullity the unite state and soviet russia have enough nuclear weapon to destroy all nation recent statement by well-known scientist regard the destructive power of the new nuclear bomb and the deadly fall-out should be sufficient to still the voice of those who advocate nuclear warfare instead of negotiation president kennedy be right when he say we shall never negotiate out of fear and we never shall fear to negotiate i have just return from a seven-week trip to europe and the far east it be quite evident that the people of western europe be overwhelmingly oppose to participation in a nuclear war the fact be that the italian french and british know that they have no defense against nuclear bomb we have no right to criticize they a they realize they would be sit duck in a nuclear war we should stand firmly and courageously for we right to free access into berlin it would be criminal folly if the communist try to prevent we but there be nothing we can do to stop soviet russia from grant de facto recognition to east germany soviet russia have be invade twice by german troop in a generation in the last war russia lose more than ten million kill and it land and factory be devastate probable agreement the truth be that communist russia fear the resurgence of german militarism berlin be merely be use by moscow a a stalk horse actually the communist out of fear of a unite and arm germany would probably be will to agree to a disarm germany that would be unite and neutral and have it independence guarantee by the un if the communist be sincere in want a unite neutral and disarm germany it might well be advantageous for the german people in this nuclear age it could provide security without cost of armament and increase german prosperity and lessen taxation france and other western european nation likewise fear a rearm germany if the german people favor such a settlement we should not oppose germany follow the example of austria president kennedy have urge a peace race on disarmament that might be call operation survival which have many facet why not make a begin with a unite and disarm germany whose neutrality and immunity from nuclear bomb would be guarantee by the big four power and the unite state a unite germany free of militarism might be the first step toward disarmament and peace in a terrorize and torture world meet un obligation to the editor of the new york time in you editorial of sept 30 the smoldering congo you make the follow comment far too many

hold step toward world order to the editor of the new york time in you sept 27 editorial appraisal of the work of the first session of the eighty-seventh congress you refer to the lack of consciousness of destiny in a time of acute national and world peril yet you list of thing leave undo do not include repeal of the connally amendment to this country s domestic jurisdiction
