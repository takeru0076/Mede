abstract experiment be make on an electric arc apply a porous graphite anode cool by a transpire gas argon thus the energy transfer from the arc to the anode be partly feed back into the arc it be show that by proper anode design the net energy loss of the arc to the anode could be reduce to approximately 15 % of the total arc energy a detail energy balance of the anode be establish the anode ablation could be reduce to a negligible amount the dependence of the arc voltage upon the mass flow velocity of the transpirating gas be investigate for various arc length and current between 100 amp and 200 afj qualitative observation be make and high-speed motion picture be take to study flow phenomenon in the arc at various mass flow velocity introduction the high heat flux exist at the electrode surface of electric arc necessitate extensive cool to prevent electrode ablation the cool requirement be particularly severe at the anode in free-burning electric arc for instance approximately 90 % of the total arc power be transfer to the anode give rise to local heat flux in excess of afj a measure by the author the exact value depend on the arc atmosphere in plasma generator a currently commercially available for industrial use or a high temperature research tool often more than 50 % of the total energy input be be transfer to the cool medium of the anode the high heat transfer rate at the anode compare with those at the cathode can be explain by the physical phenomenon occur in free burn arc in plasma generator the superimpose force convection may modify the picture somewhat the heat transfer to the anode be due to the follow effect 1 heat of condensation work function plus kinetic energy of the electron impinging on the anode this energy transfer depend on the current the temperature in the arc column the anode material and the condition in the anode sheath 2 heat transfer by molecular conduction a well a by radiation from the arc column the heat transfer to the anode in free burn arc be enhance by a hot gas jet flow from the cathode towards the anode with velocity up afj this phenomenon have be experimentally investigate in detail by maecker ref 1 the pressure gradient produce the jet be due to the nature of the magnetic field in the arc rapid decrease of current density from cathode to the anode hence the flow condition at the anode of free burn arc resemble those near a stagnation point it be apparent from the above and from experimental evidence that the cool requirement for the anode of free burn arc be large compare with those for the cathode the gas flow through a plasma generator will modify these condition however the anode be still the part receive the large heat flux an attempt to improve the life of the anode or the efficiency of the plasma generator must therefore aim at a reduction of the anode loss the follow possibility exist for achieve this 1 the use of high voltage and low current by proper design to reduce electron heat transfer to the anode for a give power output 2 continuous motion of the arc contact area at the anode by flow or magnetic force 3 feedback of the energy transfer to the anode by apply gas transpiration through the anode the third method be to we knowledge successfully apply for the first time by c sheer and co-worker ref 2 the purpose of the present study be to study the thermal condition and to establish an energy balance for a transpiration cool anode a well a the effect of blow on the arc voltage gas injection through a porous anode transpiration cool not only feed back the energy transfer to the anode by the above mention process but also modify the condition in the arc itself a detail study of this latter phenomenon be not attempt in this paper argon be use a a blow gas to exclude any effect of dissociation or chemical reaction the anode material be porous graphite sinter porous metal should be usable in principle however technical difficulty arise by melt at local hot spot the experimental arrangement a describe below be base on the geometry of free burn arc thus direct comparison can be draw with free burn arc which have be study in detail during the past year and decade by numerous investigator ref 3 experimental apparatus figure 1 to 3 show photographic and schematic view of the test stand and of two different model of the anode holder the cathode consist of a 14 diameter thoriated tungsten rod attach to a water cool copper tube this tube could be adjust in it axial direction by an electric drive to establish the require electrode space the anode in figure 2 be mount by mean of the anode holder which be attach to a steel plug and disk the transpire gas eject from the anode form a jet direct axially towards the cathode below inflow of air from the surround atmosphere be prevent by the two disk show in figure 2 argon be also blow at low velocity mass flow rate afj through a tube coaxial with the cathode a an additional precaution against contamination of the arc by air the anode consist of a 12 inch diameter porous graphite plug 14 inch long the graphite be national carbon nc 60 which have a porosity of 50 % and an average pore size of 30 this small pore size be require to ensure uniformity of the flow leave the anode the anode plug figure 2 be insert into a carbon anode holder a shield thermocouple be use to measure the upstream temperature of the transpire gas it be expose to a high velocity gas jet a plug and a tube with hole in it cylindrical wall divide the chamber above the porous plug into two part this arrangement have the purpose to prevent heat gas to reach the thermocouple by natural convection two pyrometer show in figure 1 and 2 pyrometer instrument co model 95 serve for simultaneous measurement of the anode surface temperature and the temperature distribution along the anode holder three thermocouple be place at different location in the aluminum disk surround the anode holder to determine it temperature another anode holder use in the experiment be show in figure 3 in this design the anode holder be water cool and the heat loss by conduction from the anode be determine by measure the temperature rise of the coolant to reduce heat transfer from the hot gas to this anode holder outside the regime of the arc a carbon shield be attach to the surface provide an air gap of 116 inch between the plate and the surface of the anode holder in addition the inner surface of the carbon shield be cover with aluminum foil to reduce radiation temperature of the shield and of the surface of the water-cooled anode holder be measure by thermocouple to account for heat receive by the coolant but not originate from the anode plug the argon flow from commercial bottle be regulate by a pressure regulator and measure with a gas flow rator the power source be a commercial dc rectifier at 100 amp the 360 cycle ripple be less than 05 v peak to peak with a resistive load the current be regulate by mean of a variable resistor and measure with a 50 mv shunt and millivoltmeter the arc voltage be measure with a voltmeter whose terminal be connect to the anode and cathode holder because of the fall characteristic of the rectifier no ballast resistor be require for stability of operation a high frequency starter be use to start the arc experimental procedure and error analysis 1 transpiration cool anode with carbon anode holder the anode holder show in figure 2 be design with two goal in mind the heat loss of the holder be to be reduce a far a possible and they should be such that an accurate heat balance can be make in order to reduce the number of variable parameter all experiment be make with a constant arc length of 05 and a current of 100 afj the argon flow through the porous anode be vary systematically between afj and afj the low limit be determine by the fact that for small flow rate the arc start to strike to the anode holder instead of to the porous graphite plug and that it become highly unstable the upper limit be determine by the difficulty of measure the characteristic anode surface temperature see below since only a small region of the anode be strike by the arc this region which have a high temperature than the rest of the anode surface change size and location continuously for each mass flow rate the arc voltage be measure to measure the surface temperature of the anode plug the surface be scan with a pyrometer a it turn out a very hot region occur on the plug it temperature be denote by afj the size of this hot region be estimate by eye the rest of the surface have a temperature which decrease towards the outer diameter of the plug the mean temperature of this region be approximate by the temperature measure halfway between the edge of the hot spot and the rim of the plug it be denote by afj the mean temperature of the surface be then compute accord to the follow relation afj where x be the fraction of the plug area cover by the hot spot assume thermal equilibrium between the anode surface and the transpire argon the gas enthalpy rise through the anode be calculate accord to the relation afj whereby the specific heat of argon be take a afj this calculation result in an enthalpy rise which be somewhat high because it assume a mass flow equally distribute over the plug cross section whereas in reality the mass velocity be expect to be small in the region of high temperature the upstream gas temperature measure with the thermocouple show in figure 2 be afj the afj value be list in table 1 together with the measure surface temperature and arc voltage simultaneously with the anode surface temperature and voltage measurement pyrometer reading be take along the cylindrical surface of the carbon anode holder a indicate on figure 2 some of these temperature be plot in figure 4 they show no mark dependence on the flow rate within the accuracy of these measurement thus the dot line show in figure 4 be take a typical for the temperature distribution for all blow rate the thermocouple in the aluminum disk show in figure 2 indicate an equilibrium temperature of the surface of afj this temperature be take a environmental temperature to which the anode holder be expose a far a radiation be concern it be sufficiently small compare with the surface temperature of the anode holder to make the energy flux radiate from the environment toward the anode holder negligible within the accuracy of the present measurement the reflection of radiation originate from the anode holder and reflect back to it by the surround metal surface should also be small because of the peculiar characteristic of the metal surface and of the specific geometry the total heat loss through the anode holder include also the heat conduct through the base of the cylindrical piece into the adjacent metal part it be calculate from the temperature gradient afj at afj inch a afj the total heat flux from the porous plug into the plug holder be thereby afj the temperature distribution of figure 4 give afj for all blow rate assume afj the temperature dependent value of \*\* you be take from ref 7 the radiation loss from the anode surface be compute accord to afj where afj be the mean of the fourth power of the temperature afj and afj calculate analogously to equation 1
