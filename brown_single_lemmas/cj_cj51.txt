the precondition of sociology have remain largely unexamined by the sociologist like primitive number in mathematics the entire axiological framework be take to rest upon it operational worth but what be the operational worth of a sociology which mimetically reproduce the idea of physical model be it not the task of philosophy to see what intelligible mean can be assign to the most sacred canon in social science it have become painfully clear that the very attempt to make the language of social research free of value by erect mathematical and physical model be itself a condition response to a world which pay a premium price for technological manipulation this push to confine the study of mass behaviour to the measurement of parameter involve in differential equation have lead sociology perilously close to the reduction of the word mass to mean a small group in which certain relation between all pair of individual in such a group can be study cf rapoport 1959 ch 11 here i think the role of the philosopher become apparent the simple pragmatic success of the sociology of small group need to be question for if the small group notion involve the implicit claim that the phenomenon of sociological investigation be of atomic or subatomic proportion the philosopher need to know the extent to which such entity be valid the mere exploration of the unconscious ground of present-day sociology offer a rich vein of philosophical and logical investigation cf brodbeck 1959 ch 12 a parallel function for philosophy be the study of the relation between perception experientially receive and conception logically form philosophy can supply adequate criterion of mean in the selection of socially viable category this involve a sift of the empirical and rational element enter into each social science statement merton s functional sociology may have great practical use in the study of different culture yet it be perfectly clear a nagel 1957 247 - 83 and hempel 1959 271 - 307 indicate that the concept of function in sociology have be build up from physiological and biological model in which the notion of teleology ie metaphysical purpose be central cf chapter 9 functionalism a a sociological credo be therefore not a direct consequence of observation but rather an indirect consequence of philosophical inference and judgment the purpose of this sort of philosophical study of sociology be not to tyrannize but to clarify the principle of social science it be absurd to speak of philosophy a a superior enterprise to sociology since the former be a logical rational discipline where sociology be essentially descriptive and empirical such a position entail the negation of philosophy in it platonic form a something soar above and embrace the empirical and mathematical science but contrary to whitehead philosophy be not a synonym for plato the use of philosophy a a logical clear house be manifest to any approach that do not descend to pure sensationalism however when philosophy attempt to stand above the science to dictate the condition of empirical research it become formal metaphysic shape the contour of life to fit the need of legend the notion of philosophy a queen bee may fit well with authoritarian mode of political ideology but it have be note that the price of such an imperial notion of philosophy be the frustration and flagellation of the social science cf wet 1952 pt 2 ch 5 horowitz 1957b metaphysic be no long a direct grapple with nature a it be in antiquity it have surrender any claim of description in favor of psychological account of nothingness a in heidegger s system 1929 science be mock for wish to know nothing of nothing in a last ditch effort to save the god at the expense of man it be not positivism which have isolate metaphysic from reality by distinguish between description and prescription it be simply reveal the state to which metaphysical think have fall during this century consider the traditional four field of philosophy logic ethics epistemology and esthetics it be a commonplace that to the degree these special preserve of past philosophic hunt ground establish an empirical content and suitable methodological criterion they move away from philosophy a such what be leave to traditional system of philosophy be in effect only the history of these field prior to they become rigorous enough to abide by the canon of scientific method in this situation philosophy have survive by separate itself from metaphysic by show the ultimate question to be the meaningless question the relinquish by philosophy of pretentious claim to empirical priority give it an ability to treat problem of mean and truth which in the past it be unable to examine because of it missionary attitude to knowledge of more humble sort in the new situation philosophy be able to provide the social science with the same guidance that mathematics offer the physical science a reservoir of logical relation that can be use in frame hypothesis have explanatory and predictive value beyond this philosophy may urge the social science forward by ask the type of question that fall outside the present scope of social inquiry but within it potential domain of relevance in this connection it might be note that the theory of game be a mathematical discovery long before it use in political science be exploit likewise kant formulate the nebular hypothesis accord to which the solar system be evolve from a rotate mass of incandescent gas nearly a half century before it scientific value be make plain by laplace in he systeme do monde this do not mean that philosophy resolve the problem it generate any more so than riemann s geometry settle the physical status of the space-time continuum but the forceful presentation of new issue for the science to work on be itself a monumental task to those raise on marcel s homo viator and heidegger s das nichtige this may seem a modest role for philosophy however modesty and triviality be different quality philosophy conceive of a servant to the science might appear a less dramatic than philosophy which jeer a the science evolve the ceaseless effort to understand and measure the distance mankind have traverse since it primitive anthropological status offer a more durable sort of drama by clarify fundamental premise in the social science and define the logical problem emergent at the borderland of each new scientific discipline philosophy can offer the sort of distinction that can accelerate growth in human understand philosophy can prevent the work scientist from become slothful and self-content by note the assumption and level at which a hypothesis or theory be frame the dissection of scientific theory the examination of a theory from the vantage-points of language epistemology and ethics be itself a distinct contribution to knowledge no less so because of it removal from empirical research the realm of science whatever the degree of precision in formulation cover the range of prediction and explanation cf hempel and oppenheim 1948 135 - 75 whatever philosophy be conceive to be it rationalist logistic attitude to evidence should make it clear that it be something other than science for some form of philosophy this very division between the empirical and the rational become a sign of the metaphysical superiority of the latter bergson and leroy announce that the secret be the center of a philosophy and thereafter a hundred follower declare secrecy a high verity this be simply a confession of intellectual sterility spruce up to look virtuous for a merleau-ponty indicate 1953 it be not the secret which be important but the removal of secrecy in this philosophy and science share a common goal the hypostatization of the secret nonetheless guarantee that the division of analytical and synthetic philosophy shall not be overcome by even the most persuasive argument for this division be but an abstract representation of the social struggle between mysticism and science the mystification of metaphysical system do not imply the demise of philosophy only the close of a philosophic age which demand metaphysic to be rational and logical the tenacity with which present metaphysical attitude fetishize private intuition offer the strong evidence that the gulf between scientific and delphic way of philosophize be build into the present conflict over the limit and purpose of science religion and ideology cf mcglynn 1958 scientific system and this include even the relation of mechanist to relativist physics be build upon refine and correct philosophic system by the very nature of they completeness be overthrow by rival system in addition to the incompleteness of science and the completeness of metaphysic they differ in that science be essentially descriptive while philosophy in it inherit form tend to be goal-oriented teleological and prescriptive the threadbare notion that belief unlike behaviour be not subject to objective analysis have place intuitive metaphysic squarely against the sociology of knowledge since it be precisely the job of the sociology of knowledge to treat belief a social fact no less viable than social behaviour when deal with the actual relation of philosophy to the sociology of knowledge or good the role of philosophy in assist research on the social source of idea one have to become necessarily selective certain feature we have touch upon philosophy a a logical deductive system from which a social science methodology can be build up philosophic analysis of the assumption and presumption of the social science and philosophy a a guide to possible integration of supposedly disparate sociological investigation the objection will be raise that the most important role of philosophy in relation to social science have be omit namely the status of ultimate value question and norm operative in the social science specifically it will be ask whether the real question people ask be not the ultimate question that social science find itself impotent in the face of what then be the status of such question a be society the ground of human existence or a mean to an individual goal do society develop accord to cosmic pattern or be they subject only to the free choice of individual do society really exist a an entity over and above the agglomeration of man i think it must be say that contrary to metaphysical insistence these be question so frame a to defy either empirical exploration or rational solution a simmel 1908 and dilthey 1922 indicate question of whether the value of life be individual or social be not question but assertion of faith make to appear a legitimate question such pseudo-questions assume that answer of concrete significance can be supply to statement involve undefined universal social theory have no more right to expect result from meaningless question than physics have the right to expect a theological solution to the wave-particle controversy it be not that such question be not ask it be rather that introduce they into social analysis reflect not so much a search for truth a for certainty an operational approach to sociology can never expect abstract certainty since it be certainty which every new discovery in science either replace or reshape to raise the add objection that man require certainty on psychological ground answer to ultimate question have an irrational rather than scientific basis be in a real sense to undermine the objection itself for what concern all scientific discipline be precisely that which can be capture for the rational ie for the scientific determination of what in past age be consider ultimate and irrational a philosophy which attempt to supply ultimate answer in an ultimate way reveal it acquiescence in the shortcoming of man an impatience with partial tentative solution man have always live in a tentative world and in suspension of ultimate judgment where and when necessary uncertainty overcome itself be the precondition of the quest for new and more precise information about the world without such uncertainty we be leave with a set of dogma and myth the functional interplay of philosophy and science should a a minimum guarantee a meaningful option to myth-making a degree of indefiniteness be a salutary condition for the growth of science
