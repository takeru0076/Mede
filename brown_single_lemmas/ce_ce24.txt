the russian gymnast beat the tar out of the american gymnast in the 1960 olympic for one reason they be good they be good train good look good build good discipline and something else they be good dancer we athlete be only just begin to learn that they must study dance the russian be all train a dancer before they start to study gymnastics but why gymnastics at all and be the sport really important after all we do pretty well in some other area of the olympic competition but if it be important what can we do to improve ourselves it be more than just lack of dance train that be we problem for just a gymnastics can learn from dance dance have some very important thing to learn from gymnastics take first thing first let s understand the sport call gymnastics it be make up of tumble which might be say to start with a somersault run through such stunt a headstands handstand cartwheel backbends and culminate in nearly impossible combination of aerial flip and twist and apparatus work the apparatus use by gymnast be once a common sight in american gym but about 1930 it be drop in favor of game the parallel bar horse buck springboard horizontal bar ring and mat formerly in the school gym be replace by baseball volleyball basketball and football but the russian use gymnastics a the first step in train for all other sport because it provide train in every basic quality except one endurance the gymnast must develop strength flexibility coordination time rhythm courage discipline persistence and the desire for perfection in short gymnastics use every part of the body and require a great deal of character a well the addition of endurance train late when the body be mature enough to benefit from it without danger of injury provide that final quality that make the top athlete soldier or citizen another reason gymnastic study be valuable be that it can be start very early in life an enterprising teacher or parent could start train a healthy child at the age of seven day most european have be exercise newborn infant for century in most sport a in most walk of life the angel be on the side of those who begin young and the russian competitor of 16 have at least thirteen year of train behind he the american be very lucky if he have three if a nation wish to get a head start in physical fitness over all other nation it would start it kindergarten student on a program of gymnastics the day they enter and thus eliminate a large number of the problem that plague american school first of the problem attack would be fatigue and emotional tension since action relieve both oddly enough it be prove that there would be less read difficulty certainly there would be less anxiety fewer accident it be the clumsy child who sustain the bad injury and high scholastic average since alert child work good russia know this and that be why there be over 800000 compete for place a candidate for the olympic gymnastic team eighty thousand win top honor and a chance to try for the team itself we could scarcely find eighty in we great land of over 180 million people and what have dance to do with all this a great deal russia s young gymnast have study dance before have the rigorous train on apparatus well-stretched train in posture and coordinate movement and wed to rhythm they present the audience in rome with one of the most beautiful sight ever see at any olympic contest american audience in particular learn two valuable lesson they see completely masculine and obviously virile man perform with incredible grace they be far strip of old wive s tale by see the slender lovely russian girl perform feat require tremendous strength and with not one bulge muscle president kennedy have ask that we become a physically fit nation if we wait until child be in junior high or high school we will never manage it to be fit one have to start early with young child and today the only person who really reach such child be the teacher of dance if the dance teacher of america make it they business to prepare they young charge for the gymnastics that must come some day if we school be really responsible we will be that much ahead school teacher all too unprepared for the job they must do will need demonstrator there should be youngster who know how to do a headstand and also how to help other child learn it they should know simple exercise that could prepare less fortunate child for the sport we will demand be teach dance teacher can respond to president kennedy s request not only through they regular dance work but also through the kind of basic gymnastic work that make for strength and flexibility very little in today s live provide the strength we need and nothing provide the flexibility dancer do have flexibility they often fail however to develop real abdominal back chest shoulder and arm strength ask any group of ballerina to do ten push-up or three chin-up and the result consider the amount of physical train they have have will be very disappoint even the boy will not be outstanding in these area this be nt surprise when we consider that over 29 percent of the 11-year-old boy in america can not chin themselves once and that english school girl outdo they in almost every test even dash and endurance the only area in which american boy hold they own be the baseball throw the chinning bar for arm and shoulder strength a chinning bar be recommend it should be install over a door that be in full view of everyone and a chair should be place under it a little to one side those child who can chin themselves should be tell to do one chin-up each time they pass under it those who be too weak should climb on the chair and start at the top of the chin let themselves slowly down when they can take ten second to accomplish the descent they will have the strength to chin-up parent should be inform about this system and encourage to do the same with the whole family at home the horse kick arm shoulder chest upper and low back strength will be aid with the horse kick start on hand and foot keep the hand in the start position run in place to a quick rhythm after this have become easy use slow and slow rhythm kick high and high follow this by cross from one corner of the room to the other on all fours kick a high a possible push-up push-up be essential but few have the strength for they at first start on the knee in a large circle fall slowly forward onto the hand and let the body down to rest on the floor push back up and repeat do this exercise six time each class period a strength improve start in a stand position with leg wide apart and upper body bend forward start by fall forward to a point close to the foot and a strength improve fall far and far out try to push back to the stand position from the stretch position without any intermediate push from the hand the push-up itself can be teach by start at the top of the push-up with leg spread wide let the body down slowly take at least five second for the let down five of these do daily for about a week will develop the strength for one push-up handstand handstand come after arm chest and shoulder have develop at least a minimum of strength of course those who have develop more will find they easy start with the class stand in a circle with weight on the right foot and the leave extend a little way into the circle at first each child should do a kick-up by himself so that the teacher can determine those ready to work alone and those who need help drop both hand to the floor and at the same time kick the right foot up in back the leave will follow at once the right will land first follow by the leave return to the stand position care should be take to see that the hand be place on the floor before the kick start and also that the land foot be bring a close to the hand a possible this will prevent flat fall and toe injury bare foot be good for such work than any form of slipper eventually the class will be able to kick up high enough so that the teacher can catch the lead leg the child should then bring both leg together overhead point the toe and tighten the seat muscle be sure that the land foot be bring close to the hand and that only one foot land at a time backbends the backbend be of extreme importance to any form of free gymnastics and a with all acrobatic the sooner begin the good the result have the class lie supine with knee apart and bend place flat palm on either side of the head a few inch away from the ear finger point toward the shoulder arch the back upwards to make a bridge be sure the head drop backward so that the child look at the floor rather than toward the ceiling a flexibility improve the foot will move close to the hand and the bridge rise high late this can be combine with the handstand to provide a walkover back circle to far increase back flexibility work on the back circle have the class lie prone place the hand in front of the chest keep the leg straight and the toe point straighten the arm slowly this arch the back at the peak of the arch tip the head back and bend the knee in an effort to touch toe to head improvement can be measure by the lessen distance between toe and head somersault the last essential to the beginner s gymnastic program be the somersault or forward roll this use to be part of every child s bag of trick but few child can do it today some be actually incapable of roll forward and be completely confuse when not sit or stand upright for most small child learn a forward roll be simply a matter of copy another child who can after it have be see have the child start on a mat on hand and knee a thin inexpensive mat be quite sufficient for anything that do not require fall he place the hand on either side of the head keep the chin down on the chest he then push he seat into the air and the teacher guide it over one or two practice run should be sufficient for solo if however the child be weak overweight or afraid more help will be need when the child raise he seat into the air the teacher take hold under both side of the pelvis then no matter what happen the child s performance will be control by lift the seat upwards a little the weight be take off the neck and the back be keep round these be beginning but correctly learn they prepare for satisfy and exciting stunt that can be perform by a strong flexible body we be not talk of eccentric extreme even if gymnastics be not the ultimate goal the good tumbler will be a good dancer a good athlete and a human be with a great margin of safety in any activity it be very important for parent to understand that early train be imperative and dance school so helpful in artistic and psychological development also contribute to this essential early train and can contribute even more
