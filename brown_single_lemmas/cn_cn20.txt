they be west of the sabine but only god know where for three day they stolid ox have plod up a blaze valley a flat and featureless a a dead sea molten glare singe they eyelid an angry crimson suffocate air sap they strength and strain they nerve to snap dust choke they throat and lie like acid in they lung and the valley stretch endlessly out ahead scorch and bake and writhing in it heat until it vanish into the throb wall of fiery orange word haze ben prime extend he high-stepped stride until he could lie he goad across the nose of the ox hoa-whup he command from he raw throat and feel the pain of movement in he crack black burn lip he remove he hat to let the trap sweat cut rivulet through the dust film upon he gaunt face he spit the dust-thick saliva come from he mouth like ball cotton he move back to the wheel and stand there blow grasp the top of a speak to still the tremble of he played-out limb the burn air dry he sweat-soaked clothe in salt-edged patch he clear he throat and wet he lip a cheerfully a possible he say well i guess we could all do with a little drink he unlash the dipper and draw water from a barrel they could no long afford the luxury of the canvas sweat bag that cool it by evaporation the water be warm and stale and have a brackish taste but it be water thank the lord they still have water he cleanse he mouth with a small quantity he take a long but carefully control draught he replenish the dipper and hand it to he young wife ride the hurricane deck she take it grudgingly she dark eye baleful a they meet he she drink and push back she gingham bonnet to wet a kerchief and wipe she face she set the dipper on the edge of the deck leave it for he to stretch after it while she look on scornfully what happen when there s no more water she ask smolderingly she be like charcoal he think dark opaque explosive she thick hair be the color and texture of charcoal she temper spark like charcoal when it first light up and all the time she have the heat of hatred in she like charcoal that be burn on it under side but not visibly a ripple run through the muscle of he jaw but he keep control upon he voice there must be some water under there he tilt he homely face toward the dry bed of the river we can get it if we dig he say patiently and add fever to we trouble she scoff or do you want to see if i can stand fever too we can boil it he say she chin sharpen we re lose and burn up already she bit out tensely the tire be rattle on the wheel now they ll roll off in another day there be no valley like this on you map you do nt even know where we re head hettie he say a gently a he could we re still head west somewhere we ll hit a trail somewhere she repeat maybe in time to make a cross and dig we grave he wide mouth compress in a way he could nt blame she he have pick out this pathless trail instead of the common one in a moment of romantic fancy to give they privacy on they honeymoon it have be a mistake but anything would have be a mistake a it turn out it be nt the roughness and crudity and discomfort of the trip that have frighten she she have hate the whole idea before they start actually she have hate he before she ever see he it have be five day too late before he learn that she d go through the wedding ceremony in a semitrance of laudanum administer by she mother the bitterness of they wedding night still rip within he like an open wind she have jump away from he shy touch like a cat confront by a sidewinder he have leave she inviolate think familiarity would gentle she in time but each mile westward she have hate he the deep he stare at the dipper turn it over and over in he wide callouse hand i suppose he mutter i can sell the outfit for enough to send you home to you folk once we find a settlement do nt try to be noble she laugh be hard they would nt have sell i in the first place if there d be food enough to go around he wince hettie they do nt sell you he say miserably they know i be a good sharecrop farmer back in carolina but out west be a chance to build a real farm of we own they think it would be a chance for you to make a life out where nobody will be think any good than the next except for just what s inside of they without money or property what would you have have at baton rouge i might have starve but at least i would nt be fry to a crisp and soak with dirt he darken under he heavy burn he blue eye seek the shimmer sea of haze ahead to he puzzlement there suddenly be no haze the valley lie clear and open to the eye right up to the sharp-limbed line of gaunt scour hill that form the horizon twenty mile ahead then he notice the cloud race upon they heavy ominous leaden cloud that form even a they slice over the crest of the surround hill he have never see cloud like they before but he have the primitive feel of danger that grip a man before a hurricane in carolina he holler hoarsely hang on and goad the ox a he yell he want to turn they put the wagon against the storm too late he realize that in turn he have wheel they onto a patch of sandy ground instead of atop a grade or ridge he swing up over the wheel you have good get inside he warn she but she sit on in stubborn silence the cloud bulge downward and burst suddenly into a great black funnel freeze they stare at it whirl down the valley gouge and spit out boulder and chunk of earth like a starve hound dog crack marrowbone the six-ton conestoga begin to whip and shake they world turn black it be fill with dust and wind and sound and violence the heaven open pelt they with hail the size of walnut and then come the water not rain but solid sheet that sluice down like water slop from a bucket wall of water rush down the slope and fill the hollow like the crest of flash flood through the splash of the rise water they could hear the roar of the river a it rage through it canyon gnash big chunk out of the bank the jet froth surface of the river reach the level of the runoff the dangerous current upon the prairie cease but the water stand and keep on rise they cringe under sodden cover listen to the wave slop against the bottom the cloudburst cut off abruptly they be engulf by the weird silence break only by the low angry murmur of the river then the darkness thin and there be light again and then bright sunlight beat with fear and sound and wet and chill they crawl to the hurricane deck and look out haggardly at a world of water that reach clear to the surround hill the water level be high than they hub only the heavy bone of the ox keep they anchored there be no real sign of the river now just a roil oily ribbon of liquid movement through muddy water that reach everywhere clump of brush ride down the ribbon now and then the glisten side of a half-swamped object show a it sweep past the girl crawl out into the renew warmth of the sunshine hug she shoulder and still tremble she face be pale but set and she dark eye smoldered with blame for ben out of compulsion to say something cheery ben prime blurt well we be lucky to be on soft ground when the first floodheads hit at least the wheel dig in the soak will put life back in the wagon too he wife do nt give a sign she d hear she be watch a tree ride wildly down that roil current somebody be ride the tree it race close and they could see a woman with white hair sit astride an upright branch she do not call out but a the tree pass she lift an arm in gesture of good luck and farewell they watch the tree until it twist sharply on a bend it spear up into the air then sink back the up-jutting branch turn slowly the pale blob of the woman disappear there s the one who s lucky the girl murmur harshly ben s eye strain with the bitter hurt he homely face slash with gray and crimson then he take off he wet boot and drop down into the water to talk with the beast need they comfort more than they need he it be nearly sundown and he go to the back of the wagon half-swimming he way for he be not a tall man he let down the tailgate and be knock over by the sluice of water he sputter back to he foot and scramble madly to pull he bag of seed grain forward they be already swell to burst of all they worldly belongings next to the ox and he gun the seed grain have be the most treasure it be spoil now for seed and it would sour and mold in three day if they fail to find a place and fuel to dry it the ox might a well enjoy it he examine the water mark on the iron tire when the animal be finish the water lie muddy but placid without a ripple of movement against the wheel there be not a match-width of damp mark to show they be recede he doubt if a man could wade a far a the desolate dry hill that rim the valley a terrible numb sense of futility sweep over he he grip the wheel hard to fight the despondency of defeat then he notice that the dry wood of the wheel have swell the spoke be tight again the iron tire grip onto the wheel a if of one piece hope surge within he he swing toward the front to give the news to hettie then stop bar from she by the vehemence of she blame and hate still he feel good a tight wagon mean so much he get a small fire start and put on bacon and coffee he pour the water off the sourdough and off the flour salvage the chunky watery mess for biscuit of a sort they jam and jelly have not suffer he find a jar of preserve tomato and one of egg that they have mean to save now he break they open hope a good meal might lessen this depression crush hettie he long nose wiggle at the smell of frizzling bacon and heat java but the fire be low and he want to waste no time he furl the slash side of the canvas tarpaulin leave the rib and wagon open he look thoughtfully at he wife s trunk hold she meager treasure he say hesitantly hettie i do nt figure you thing get wet too much that s a good trunk if you want to get they air she say without turn she head after that rain beat in atop the dust there be nt a thing that will nt be streak he draw a long breath and open the trunk and hang out she clothe and spoilables upon the wagon rib
