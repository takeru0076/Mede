too often a begin bodybuilder have to do he train secretly either because he parent do nt want sonny-boy to lift all those old barbell thing because you ll stunt you growth or because childish taunt from he schoolmate like hey lookit mr america whaddya gonna do with all those muscle of which he have none at the time after all a guy s gotta have a little ego therefore it s a genuine pleasure to tell you about an entirely happy bodybuilder who have never have to train in secret have never hear one unkind word from he parent and never have be taunt by he schoolmate this happy always smile lad with the sunny disposition be we new junior mr canada henri de courcy far from discourage henri he parent urge he on to great and great accomplishment instead of admonish he to let the weight alone they personally take he to that master montreal bodybuilding authority professor roland claude and they could nt have entrust henri to good hand because le professeur know he muscle from the sterno-cleido mastoideus of the neck right down to the tibialis anticus of the leg and good still he know just what exercise work good for they and what weid principle to combine they with for fast fast muscle growth that s because the good professor teach only weid method at he famous montreal health studio which be locate at 1821 mt royal east in montreal undoubtedly you have read the case history of some of he prize-winning pupil every pupil have a physique title of some kind or other there s gaetan damours who be we new mr canada jean-paul senesac whose story appear here two issue ago jack boissoneault who be with we last month charles harve who recently win the most muscular man subdivision award in the mr canada event and a host of other yesiree the professor know he muscle now when henri be just 12 he be only 4 10 tall and weigh an astound 72 pound and he great desire be to pack on some weight about that time he begin read mr america and muscle builder and he learn of the famous weid way to fast weight gain see so many illustration and read so many testimonial to the value of quick-wate and super-protein those two wonder-working weid food supplement he decide to try they and see what they could do for he well sir they do real great for in almost less time than it take to tell it henri s bodyweight be increase rapidly of course he do some exercise he s crazy about water ski and swim and this vigorous exercise in conjunction with the add food supplement pack pound of solid muscle on he skinny frame henri have always have shapely leg from swim and water ski and really do nt have to work they very much but he be totally dissatisfied with he upper body it be muscular but it be nt symmetrical a real nothing torso say henri it never seem to widen it just get long and long that s when he go to professor claude and at once claude see what the trouble be and he know just how to correct it in he gym the professor have some of the most knock out equipment since vic tanny mr claude be a specialist in torso development and he have long favore the now-famous weid push-pull super-set technique in which one exercise of the super-set be a press or push movement which accent one sector of a muscle group in a specific way follow by a pull exercise which work the oppose sector of the same muscle group so right away claude introduce henri to he famous moon bench and proceed to teach he he first push-pull super-set consist of the wide-grip straight-arm pullover the pull part of the push-pull super-set which dramatically widen the ribcage and strongly affect the muscle of the upper back and chest and the collar-to-collar bench press which specifically work on the chest to build those wide reeves-type gladiator pec while stimulate the upper lat and frontal deltoid a you can see in this push-pull super set the entire chest-back-shoulder area be vigorously exercise in alternate sector by alternate exercise so the complete torso remain pumped-up all the time now when henri have complete four complete push-pull super-sets no 1 the professor allow he about a five-minute rest period before start he on four complete push-pull super-sets no 2 super-set no 2 be make up of similar exercise but this time do with dumbbell and use both moon and flat bench the push exercise of this push-pull super-set be the bench press do with elbow well pull back and with a great downward stretch of the pectoral not possible with the barbell variation you need the barbell variation to build width and mass in the pec the dumbbell variation develop a most classically sculpture outline to the afj the pull exercise in this super-set be the one-dumbbell bent-arm pullover note how strongly the upper lat and serratus be work in this fine exercise because of the pin-point concentration of force which the dumbbell variation afford in the third push-pull super-set the push exercise be the widegrip pushup between bar while the pull exercise be the moon bench lateral raise with bend arm the pushup do in this manner be the great pectoral-ribcage stretcher ever invent this be true only if a very wide grip be use and only when the great possible stretch be achieve you ll know when you ve make the great stretch because you shoulder blade will touch a you see the professor have design a piece of apparatus that force the bodybuilder to use a w-i-d-e grip he have to he just can nt do anything about it at all but a you can also see it s not a painful exercise at all because henri de courcy the happy bodybuilder look a though he be have the time of he life the last exercise of roland claude s prescribe program for henri be a single exercise do in individual set with a bit long pause between set by this time henri s entire chest-back-lat-shoulder area be pumped-up to almost burst point and claude take time to do a bit more pectoral-front deltoid shape work he have henri do from four to six set of the incline bench press note the high incline this give a wide flare to the pec cause they to flow dramatically upward into deltoid and dramatically downward into the serratus and afj this be the kind of chest that invariably win contest that steel-edged carved-out-of-solid rock look of the great champion so with four complete push-pull super-sets no 1 four of no 2 four of no 3 and four to six set of the incline bench press you can see that henri de courcy have have a terrific mass-building muscle-shaping torso-defining workout that can not be improve upon physique contest be rarely win on muscle size alone rare still be a mr america or mr universe of true herculean build the aspect of physical development that catch the judge eye and which rightfully influence they decision be symmetry and that hallmark of the true champion superior definition of the muscle now good definition be one thing that all of we can acquire with occasional high-set high-rep light-weight workout but contest definition that dramatic muscular separation of every muscle group that seem a though it must have be carve by a sculptor s chisel be something quite different this come not alone from high-set high-rep train but from certain definition-specialization exercise which the champion select for himself with the knowledge of exactly what work good for he often these exercise work well for some bodybuilder but less spectacularly for other because they be minority exercise and have but a limit appeal they soon find themselves in the limbo of the forget only when the new mr america or mr universe discover they and put they into practice be we reacquaint with they and once again see how effective they really be the exercise i shall discuss in this the first of a new series of article on muscle definition-specialization of a particular body part be the one leg lunge why it be ever forget for even a moment i can not say because it work perfectly for everyone no matter whether he have short or long thigh-bone length it be the one exercise that drastically influence the definition of the thigh at the hipline that mark of the champion that set he apart from all other bodybuilder a criterion of muscle drama that be unforgettable to judge and audience alike the facet of muscular development that win prize definition of the thigh at the uppermost part be quite commonly see in most championship olympic lifter which be easily understandable the one leg lunge be a split and all lifter practice this in they regular workout but for purely definition purpose use in conjunction with you regular squat leg curl leg extensor program a heavy weight be not need indeed a light weight work much good because a great more extensive split can be perform use in several set of high rep once or twice each week it will not be long before you entire upper leg take on a razor-sharp definition in which the muscle look like wire cable writhing and twist under the skin really there be no reason why this fine exercise should not find it way into you leg program at all time for the follow suggestion show why it be so effective 1 it s a complete thigh contraction-extension exercise 2 it place terrific tension on the leg muscle from start to finish of each repetition 3 it improve over-all balance and control for the bodybuilder and help to make squat more easily and more correctly perform 4 it increase flexibility of the leg 5 it speed muscle growth and power development even for the advance bodybuilder because each hip and leg be exercise separately thus enable a massive concentrate effort to be focus on each you ll need you weid power stand for this fine exercise and here s the way it s do 1 place you power stand in position and adjust they height so that this will correspond to the height of you shoulder when you be in a deep leg split a for a heavy clean 2 place a suitably-loaded barbell across they grasp the bar which will rest against the back of you neck extend you foot forward and backward until you be in a deep leg split now raise the weight by straighten you front leg without move you foot when the front knee be straight and lock allow it to bend again until you feel the bar come lightly into contact with the side of the power stand 3 after you have take a breather reverse the position of you leg so that the front thigh of the previous exercise be now to the rear and the rear thigh now to the front and perform the same movement in the same manner that s the one-leg lunge in a nutshell you should have a couple of train partner to stand by when you make you first experiment just for safety you should also begin this exercise with a very light barbell until you become accustom to it balance-wise oh you ll wobble and weave quite a bit at first but do nt worry before you first train experiment have end there will be a big improvement and almost before you know it you ll be raise and lower yourself just like a veteran although i suggest that you hold the bar at the back of the neck there s no reason why you should nt make some experiment with the bar hold in front of the neck squat-style lifter and leg-split lifter would both benefit enormously by practice those variation provide that they remember to make alternate set with the leave and right leg to the front
