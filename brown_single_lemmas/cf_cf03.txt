there be a pause in the merriment a you friend gaze at you wonder why you be stare open-mouthed in amazement you explain i have the strange feel of have live through this very same event before i can nt tell when but i m positive i witness this same scene of this particular gather at some time in the past this experience will have happen to many of you emerson in he lecture refer to the startle experience which almost every person confess in daylight that particular passage of conversation and action have occur to he in the same order before whether dream or wake a suspicion that they have be with precisely these person in precisely this room and hear precisely this dialogue at some former hour they know not when most psychiatrist dismiss these instance of that weird feel a the deja vue already see illusion just a they dismiss dream previsions a coincidence in this manner they side-step the seemingly hopeless investigation of the great depth of mystery in which all of we grope continually when a man recognize a certain experience a the exact pattern of a previous dream we have an instance of deja vue except for the fact that he know just why the experience seem familiar occasionally there be example of pre-vision which can not be push aside without confess an unscientific attitude one day maeterlinck come with a friend upon an event which he recognize a the exact pattern of a previous dream detail the ensue occurrence in advance so accurately that he companion be completely mystify rudyard kipling s scorn for the jargon of psychical research be alter somewhat when he wonder how or why have i be show an unreleased roll of i life film the famous author tell we of the strange incident in something about myself one day when he attend a war memorial ceremony in westminster abbey he view be obstruct by a stout man on he leave he attention turn to the irregular pattern of the rough slab floor and someone clasp he by the arm whisper i want a word with you please at that moment kipling be overwhelm with awe amazement suddenly recall that these identical detail of scene action and word have occur to he in a dream six week early freud probably contribute more than anyone else to the understand of dream enable we to recognize they equivalent in we wakeful thought however reader who accept freud s finding and believe that he have solve completely the mystery of dream should ponder over the follow word in he interpretation of dream chapter 1 a a matter of fact no such complete solution of the dream have ever be accomplish in any case and what be more every one attempt such solution have find that in most case there have remain a great many component of the dream the source of which he have be unable to explain nor be the discussion close on the subject of the mantic or prophetic power of dream dream present many mystery of telepathy clairvoyance prevision and retrovision the basic mystery of dream which embrace all the other and challenge we from even the most common typical dream be in the fact that they be original visual continuity i recall the startle vivid realism of a dream in which i live through the horror of the bomb of a little korean town i be sure that nothing within i be capable of compose that life-like sequence so complete in detail from the hodge-podge of news picture i have see and when psychology explain glibly but the subconscious mind be able to produce it it refer to a mental region so vaguely identify that it may embrace the entire universal mind a conceivably a part of the individual mind skeptics may deny the more startle phenomenon of dream a thing they have never personally observe but failure to wonder at they basic mystery be outright avoidance of routine evidence the question become what be a dream be a dream simply a mental or cerebral movie every dream and this be true of a mental image of any type even though it may be readily interpret into it equivalent of wakeful think be a psychic phenomenon for which no explanation be available in most case we recognize certain word person animal or object but these be dream in original action in some particular continuity which we do nt remember have see in real life for instance the dreamer see himself seat behind neighbor smith and with photographic realism see smith drive the car whereas it be a matter of fact that smith can not drive a car there be nothing to suggest that the brain can alter past impression to fit into an original realistic and unbroken continuity like we experience in dream the entire concept of cerebral imagery a the physical basis of a mental image can find no logical support a mental image subconsciously impress we from beneath it language symbol in wakeful think or consciously in light sleep be actually not an image at all but be comprise of reality view not in the concurrent sensory stream but within the depth of the fourth dimension dream that display event of the future with photographic detail call for a theory explain they basic mystery and all it component include that weird feel of deja vue inevitably fantastic though that theory must seem a in the theory of perception establish in psycho-physiology the eye be recognize a an integral part of the brain but then this theory confess that it be completely at a loss a to how the image can possibly be receive by the brain the open paragraph of the chapter title the theory of representative perception in the book philosophy of science by albert g ramsperger say pass on to the brain and there by some unexplained process it cause the mind to have a perception but why be it necessary to reproduce the retinal image within the brain a retinal image be concede to be an integral function of the brain it seem logical to suppose that the nerve between the inner brain and the eye carry the direct drive for cooperation from the various brain center rather than to theorize on the transmission of an image which be already in require location hereby the external object view by the eye remain the thing that be see not the retinal image the purpose of which would be to achieve perceptive cooperation by stir sympathetic impulse in the other sensory center motor tension associate word symbol and consciousness modern physics have develop the theory that all matter consist of minute wave of energy we know that the number of radio and television impulse sound wave ultra-violet ray etc that may occupy the very same space each solitary upon it own frequency be infinite so we may conceive the coexistence of the infinite number of universal apparently momentary state of matter successive one after another in consciousness but permanent each on it own basic phase of the progressive frequency this theory make it possible for any event throughout eternity to be continuously available at any moment to consciousness space in any form be completely measure by the three dimension if the fourth dimension be a physical concept and not purely metaphysical through what medium do it extend it be not through space nor time that the time machine most approve by science fiction must travel for a visit to the permanent prehistoric past or the ever-existent past-fantasy future three second flat be the usual time and the space be cross by moderate mileage while the overwhelming immensity of such journey must be conceive a a static pulsation through an enormous number of coexistent frequency which perpetuate all event the body sense and brain in common with all matter have they counterpart on each of a countless number of frequency the sense in each counterpart bear the impression only of phenomenon that share it own frequency whereas those upon all other frequency be invisible inaudible and intactible to they consciousness be the factor that provide the progressive continuity to sensory impression when consciousness desert the sleep body and the wakeful world it continue in the myriad progression of the ever-present past and future in a life a vibrant and real a the one leave when the body tire and require sleep if the photographically realistic continuity of dream however bizarre they combination deny that it be purely a composition of the brain it must be compound from view of diverse reality although some of they may never be encounter in what we be please to call the real life dr hv hilprecht professor of assyrian at the university of pennsylvania dream that a babylonian priest associate with the king kurigalzu 1300 bc escort he to the treasure chamber of the temple of bel give he six novel point of information about a certain break relic and correct an error in it identification a a matter of fact the incorrect classification the result of many week of labor by dr hilprecht be about to be publish by he the follow day some time late the miss part of the relic be find and the complete inscription together with other new evidence fully corroborate the ancient priest s information dr hilprecht be uncertain a to the language use by the ancient priest in he dream he be almost positive it be not assyrian nor cassite and imagine it must have be german or english we may conclude that all six point of information ostensibly give by the dream priest could have be furnish by dr hilprecht s subconscious reason but in deny any physical reality for this dream how could the brain possibly compose that realistic vividly visual continuity uninterrupted by misty fadeout violent break or sudden substitution which theory be more fantastic 1 that the perfect continuity be compose from the joblot of memory impression in the professor s brain or 2 that the dream be a reality on the infinite progression of universal gradient frequency across which the modern professor and the priest of ancient nippur meet the degree of circumstance the ratio of memory to forgetfulness determine whether a dream will be a recognize fulfil prevision or the vaguely effective source of the weird deja vue feel no doubt some experience vanish so completely a to leave no trace on the sleeper s mind probably less than one percent of we previsions escape final obliteration before we wake when we arrive at the event concern in the vanish majority they of course can not impress we a anything familiar nevertheless there be notably frequent instance of deja vue in which we recognition of an entirely novel event be a feel of have live through it before a feel which though vague withstand the verbal barrage from the most impressive corps of psychologist if deja vue be an illusion then peculiarly it be a most prevalent mental disturbance affect even the most level-headed people chauncey depew one-time runner-up for the republican presidential nomination be attend a convention at saratoga where he be schedule to nominate colonel theodore roosevelt for governor of new york when he notice that the temporary chairman be a man he have never meet after the preliminary business affair be finish depew arise and deliver the convince speech that clinch the nomination for roosevelt if depew have tell any academic psychologist that he have a weird feel of have live through that identical convention session at some time in the past he would have be inform that he be a victim of deja vue but the famous orator feel more than vague recognition for the scene he remember exactly when he have live through it before and he have something to prove he have one week before the convention depew be seat on the porch of a country home on the hudson gaze at the opposite shore
