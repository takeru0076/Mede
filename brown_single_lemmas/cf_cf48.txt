the achievement of the desegregation of certain lunch counter not only by wise action by local community leader but by voluntary action follow consultation between attorney general rogers and the head of certain national chain store should of course be applaud but for it to be just to attain this same result by mean of the force of a boycott throughout the nation would require the verification of fact contrary to those assume in the forego case the supposition in the previous illustration might be sufficiently alter by establish a connection between general company practice and local practice in the south and by establish such direct connection between the practice and the economic well-being of store locate in new york and general company policy then the boycott would not be secondary but a primary one it would be direct against the actual location of the unjust policy which for love s sake and for the sake of justice must be remove and indivisible from this to the economic injury of the people directly and objectively a part of this policy perhaps this would be sufficient to justify an economic boycott of an entire national chain in order by threaten potential injury to it entire economy to effect an alteration of the policy of it local store in the matter of segregation such a general boycott might still be a blunt or indiscriminate instrument and therefore of questionable justification action locate where the evil be concentrate will prove most decisive and be most clearly legitimate moreover prudence alone would indicate that unless the local custom be already ready to fall when push the result of direct economic action everywhere upon national chain store will likely be simply to give undue advantage to local and state store which conform to these custom lead to great decentralization and local autonomy within the company or even a the final self-defeat of an unjust application of economic pressure to correct injustice to it go out of business in certain section of the country a for that matter the quaker who once have many meeting in the pre-civil war south largely go out of business in that part of the country over the slavery issue never to recover a large number of southern adherent in any case anyone who fail to make significant distinction between primary and secondary application of economic pressure would in principle already have justify that use of economic boycott a a mean which break out a few year ago or be skillfully organize by white citizen council in the entire state of mississippi against every local philco dealer in that state in protest against a philco-sponsored program over a national tv network on which be present a drama show it seem a high yellow gal smooch with a white man it be true of course that the end or objective of this action be different but since this be a world in which people disagree about end and goal and concern justice and injustice and since in a situation where direct action and economic pressure be call for the justice of the matter have either not be clearly define by law or the law be not effectively present there have to be a morality of mean apply in every case in which people take it upon themselves to use economic pressure or other form of force the need that we not give unqualified approval to any but a limit use of economic pressure direct against the actual doer of injustice be clear also in light of the fact that white citizen council seem resolve to maintain segregation mainly by the use of these same mean and not ordinarily by physical violence an unlimited use of economic pressure for diametrically opposite cause could devastate the pre-condition of any fellow humanity a surely a this would be destroy by the use of more obviously brutal mean the end or aim of the action of course be also important especially where it be not alone a matter of change community custom but of the use of deadly economic power to intimidate a person from step forward to claim he legal right eg against negroes who register to vote in fayette county tennessee at the present moment here the recourse be in step to give economic sustenance to those be despoil and to legal remedy this however be sufficient to show that more or less non-violent resistance and economic conflict if both side be strong enough can be war of all against all no less than if other mean be use it be also sufficient to show the christian and any other champion of justice that he need to make sure not only that he cause be just but also that he conduct be just ie that if economic pressure have to be resort to this be apply directly against those person directly in the way of some salutary change in business or institutional practice while if injury fall upon other it fall upon they indirectly and secondarily however inevitably and not by deliberate intent and direct action against they it be clear that non-violent resistance be a mode of action in need of justification and limitation in christian morality like any other form of resistance the language use itself often make very clear that this be only another form of struggle for victory perhaps to be choose above all other one of the sit-in leader have say nobody from the top of heaven to the bottom of hell can stop the march to freedom everybody in the world today might a well make up they mind to march with freedom or freedom be go to march over they the present writer certainly agree with that statement and would also affirm this in the order of justice however it be also a christian insight to know that unless charity interpenetrate justice it be not likely to be freedom that march forward and when charity interpenetrate man s struggle for justice and freedom it do not simply surround this with a sentimental good will it also definitely fashion conduct in the way explain above and this mean far more than in the choice of non-violent mean rb gregg have write that non-violence and good will of the victim act like the lack of physical opposition by the user of physical jiu-jitsu to cause the attacker to lose he moral balance he suddenly and unexpectedly lose the moral support which the usual violent resistance of most victim would render he and again that the object of non-violent resistance be partly analogous to this object of war namely to demoralize the opponent to break he will to destroy he confidence enthusiasm and hope in another respect it be dissimilar for non-violent resistance demoralize the opponent only to re-establish in he a new morale that be firm because it be base on sound value a trial of strength however be make quite inevitable by virtue of the fact that anyone engage in non-violent resistance will be convince that he action be base on sound value than those of he opponent and in warfare with any mean man commonly disagree over the justice of the cause this make necessary a morality of mean and principle govern the conduct of resistance whenever this be think to be justify the question then be whether sufficient discrimination in the use of even non-violent mean of coercion be to be find in the fact that such conduct demoralize and overcome the opponent while re-moralizing and re-establish he here it be relevant to remember that man commonly regard some cause a more important than they life and to they it will seem insignificant that it be propose to defeat such cause non-violently a technique by which it be propose to enter with compulsion into the very heart of a man and determine he value may often in fact seem the more unlimited aggression among christian group the mennonite have commonly be aware more than other of the fact that the nature of divine charity raise decisively the question of the christian use of all form of pressure since the will and word of god be for they concentrate in christ-like love it seem clear to they that non-violent resistance be quite another thing the primary objective of non-violence write the outstanding mennonite ethicist be not peace or obedience to the divine will but rather certain desire social change for personal or class or national advantage without agree with every phrase in this statement we must certainly assert the great difference between christian love and any form of resistance and then go on beyond the mennonite position and affirm that christian love-in-action must first justify and then determine the moral principle limit resistance these principle we have now set forth economy in the use of power need not only to be assert but clearly specify and when this be do it will be find that the principle govern christian resistance cut across the distinction between violent and non-violent mean and apply to both alike justify either on occasion and always limit either action economy in the use of power mean more than inflict a barely intolerable pressure upon an opponent and upon the injustice oppose that would amount to calculate the mean and justify they wholly in term of they effectiveness in reach desire goal there must also be additional and more fundamental discrimination in the use of mean of resistance violent or non-violent the justification in christian conscience of the use of any mode of resistance also lay down it limitation in the distinction between the person against whom pressure be primarily direct those upon whom it may be permit also to fall and those who may never be directly repress for the sake even of achieve some great good in these term the economic withdrawal of the negroes of nashville tennessee from trade in the center city for example be clearly justify since these distinction do not require that only people subjectively guilty be single out we may now take up for consideration a hard case which seem to require either no action employ economic pressure or else action that would seem to violate the principle set forth above there may be instance in which if economic pressure be to be undertake at all this would have to be apply without discrimination against a whole people an excellent article be publish recently in the journal of the church peace union by a south african journalist on the inhuman economic condition of the black in south africa amount to virtual slavery and the economic complicity of both the government and the people of the unite state in these condition billions of american dollar not only from capital investor but also from the pocket of we taxpayer this author state be be pour into south africa to support a system dedicate to the oppression the persecution and the almost diabolical exploitation of 12 million people the color of whose skin happen not to be white both the condition and the complicity be document in considerable detail this lead to the conclusion that the fact be inescapable that america do have a say in whether or not apartheid shall continue we leadership in a wide economic boycott of south africa would be not only in accord it seem with the moral conscience of america not to be deny because we also a a people have widespread injustice in the relation of the race in we own country but also in accord with we law we code title 19 section 1307 which forbid the importation of goods make by force or convict labor not only should this provision be enforce but other economic and political action might be take which this author believe must surely be support by every american who value the freedom that have be win for he and whose conscience be not so dominate by the line in he account book that he can willingly and knowingly contribute to the enslavement of another nation
