before lose itself in the sand of the 19th century the grand stream of italian renaissance architectural decoration make a last appearance in the brumidi fresco of the capitol rotunda in washington the artistic generation after brumidi be train in the paris of that time to a more meticulous standard of execution and tend to overlook greatness of conception where fault and weakness be easy to find but it be a great conception the open ceiling with allegorical and classical figure throw in mass against the sky the close frieze formally divide into historical scene and tightly tie to the stone wall belong in they large order to the line of correggio and he baroque follower the descent may be remote but this be surely the only full-scale example of that vigorous inheritance in the unite state constantino brumidi design the decorative scheme a a whole in collaboration with the architect charles u walter at the time when plan be be make to replace the wooden dome of bullfinch with the present much large iron structure after many year and many interruption he be able to finish the canopy fresco and slightly less than half the frieze begin with the liberty group opposite the east door and end with william penn all but one leg when a tragic accident end he career he leave at he death sketch draw to scale for the rest of the circle these be carry out not too faithfully by filippo costaggini who begin by supply the miss member to the founder of pennsylvania and note in pencil in italian that he begin at this point when costaggini have use up all the sketch thirty-six foot of empty frieze be leave over a blank undecorated void plaster in roughcast disfigure the wall of the rotunda until 1951 then advise by the architect of the capitol the joint committee for the library traditionally responsible for the work of art in the build order the space clear and paint in fresco to show the peace after the civil war the spanish-american war and the birth of aviation to match a nearly a feasible brumidi s technique and composition late the clean and restoration be order first of the old part of the frieze finally of the canopy what follow be therefore a description of three separate undertaking the new frescoing of the gap and the successive essay in conservation with some discussion of problem that arise in connection with each for the use of student and future restorer a full day-by-day record be keep of all three undertaking complete technical report on what we find and what we do these may be consult in the office of the architect of the capitol or the library of congress the first preliminary be inspect the unfinished length of frieze a jumble of roughcast and finish coat all in bad condition it be decide to strip the whole area down to the brick and to replace the rough coat up to one inch thickness to agree with the old artist preparation with a mortar one part slake lime three part sand to be put on in two layer cartoon be draw full size after sketch have be make to satisfy all the authority there be some difficulty here one have to manage the give subject three diverse recent event so a to make they part of a classical frieze that be a pattern of large figure fill the space with not much else against a blank background moreover all three representation must be squeeze comfortably into little more than the length brumidi allow for each one of he when it be all arrange to fit and not to interrupt the lengthwise flow of movement in the frieze the cartoon be try in place the scaffolding a confusion of heavy beam hang from the gallery above be strong and safe but obscure visibility nothing could be see from the floor but by move around the gallery one could get glimpse and we be able to decide on some amplification of scale to be sure of match color a well a form piece of cartoon be trace on the roughcast and large sample paint in fresco then leave two month to dry out to they final key late it be gratify to note that they have set so solidly a to be hard to remove when the time come the scaffold be the length of the space to be paint what bit of brumidi and costaggini could be reach at either end seem in good order though the roughish sandy surface be thick with dust wash they come out surprisingly clear and bright it could be see that both artist use a very thick final coat of plaster one half inch and that both follow the traditional italian fresco technique a describe by cennino cennini in the 14th century and current in italy to this day that be they use opaque color throughout get solid highlight with active lime white painting a secco be much in evidence a word hatch reinforce and broaden shadow and much of the background be solidly cover with a dark coat this word be sometimes so rich in medium a to appear to be oil paint in we own practice to have the last intonaco plaster coat thick enough to match and at the same time to avoid fine crack in dry we find that it have to be put on in two layer let the first set awhile before apply the second the mortar be three part sand to two of lime some of the lime that be always on hand in the capitol basement for plaster repair be slake several month for we but to make it stiff of a really putty-like consistency to avoid crack we add a little hydrate lime hard on the hand but we could see no other disadvantage i be tell that a mortar long slake might have remain long in condition for painting a it be it take the pigment well for six hour enough for we purpose and hold it firmly in set it be obvious that to match brumidi white must be mix with all but the dark tone lime white hard and brilliant have a tendency to jump away from the other color in dry and also by it capacity to set to preclude the use of ready-made gradation so useful in decorative work in old italian practice lime dry and reground bianco sangiovanni enter into such prepare shade for convenience we choose a strong pigment unknown to the early italian or to brumidi titanium oxide reserve the active lime white for high light put on at the end of the day s stint other pigment be mostly raw umber some burn umber and a little yellow ochre this last be probably not in brumidi s palette but be need to take the chill bluish look off the new work next to the old where soften effect of time be see even after thorough clean the use of secco we try to restrict to cover joint experience show however that it be very difficult to paint a dark umber background in fresco that will not dry out spotty and uneven late brumidi and costaggini will be see cope with this same problem we be force a they be to work a good deal of tempera into background and dark area we make it by doerner s recipe five part thoroughly wash cheese curd to one of lime putty ground together they make a strong adhesive which become waterproof in dry figure 1 be take in 1953 the new part be finish on the right be the brumidi liberty group a it look after clean operation which have not yet come around to the other end where of costaggini only some foliage have be wash at the point where he work stop one be lead to speculate a to why the empty space be there leave for we century to finish costaggini say it be brumidi s fault in not provide enough material to fill the circle brumidi s son late maintain that costaggini have compress and mutilate he father s design ambitiously covete a bit he could claim for he very own this question might be settle by compare the measurement of the actual circumference with the dimension note presumably in brumidi s hand above the various section of he long preparatory draw which have be keep whosever fault it be evident that brumidi intend to fill out the whole frieze with he history and come full circle with the scene of the discovery of california gold in painting a fresco the handle of wet mortar compel one always to move from top to bottom and from leave to right not to spoil yesterday s work with today s plaster at the very first then brumidi be require by the classically pyramidal shape of he central group to fill in the triangular space above the seat girl on liberty s right before start on the allegorical figure themselves here he put a small man whose miss hand might have leave he function doubtful until comparison with the first sketch show that when the artist come back to the begin this be to be the close figure of the party of forty-niners and be to hold a basket one see costaggini s render of the same figure more than thirty foot away the photograph figure 1 of the complete frieze show how have be separate from he fellow in useless isolation for eighty year he have now be give a hand and by juxtaposition and the permission of the committee give a new job to represent the witness of the first flight at kitty hawk in 1903 the startlingly bright effect of the first washing lead the committee to order the rest of the brumidi-costaggini cycle clean and restore to go with they the fix wooden scaffold be remove and so a to reach all the frieze one of pipe on wheel build up from the floor every few day in the early morning a the work progress twenty man would appear to push it ahead and to shift the plank foundation that distribute it weight widely on the rotunda pavement support a it be by ancient brick vault on this giddy and oscillate platform over fifty foot from the floor after a first dust we begin to wash a most useful tool for wet the surface without run down be make from a greenhouse mist spray nozzle weld to a hose connection to be use at low water pressure a valve in the handle let we cut the pressure still low one man spray with a sponge in hand to check excess wet a second assistant mop with two sponge in part a repeat spong be need but everywhere we find that water alone be enough to restore the original brightness no soap or other clean agent be use that might bring in unwanted chemical reaction the painting a fresco stand up superbly a little of the secco come off necessary retouch be put on at once altogether we find the craftsmanship first rate especially brumidi s we be greatly help by there be no trace of former restore apparently not more than dust have ever be do and not much of that the plaster be sound the intonaco firmly attach all over and the pigment solidly incorporate with it in all but a few unimportant place the great source of trouble be rain which have repeatedly flow from opening above soak the surface and leave streak of dissolve lime very conspicuous even after clean particularly in the land of columbus oglethorpe and the indian and yorktown here the architect refer to the use of the capitol a a public build not a museum request some repaint to maintain decorative effect rather than leave blank unsightly patch these fresco have have no care for eighty year with naked gas jet below and leaky window above enough to ruin wall painting in any medium they have survive in a build long unheated in winter hot and damp under the iron dome in summer
