up to date however he garden be still more or less of a mess he have nt even start he workshop and if there be a meadow pond in the neighborhood he have nt find it it be nt he fault that these thing be so the difficulty be that each day seem to produce it quota of detail which must be clean up immediately a a result life have become a kind of continuous make-ready once he dispose of these item which scream so harshly for attention he could undertake the thing which really count then at last he day would fall into an order pattern and he would be free to read or garden or just wander through the wood in the late afternoon accompany by he dog he dog he have almost forget they although they have play such an important part in he early dream then they have always be romp around he on these walk yelp with delight dash off into the bush on fruitless hunt expedition return to jump up on he triumphantly with muddy paw dog do something to one s ego they be constantly assure you that you be one of the world s great guy regardless of how much of a slob you know yourself to be you could be certain they would never find out and even if they do it would make no difference now it become increasingly apparent that there be to be no dog in the picture what in the world be you go to do with a lot of dog when you leave for town on monday afternoon you certainly could nt take they into the little apartment and if you try to farm they out for two or three day every week they would become so confuse that they would have nervous breakdown why in the world could nt he live in one place the way everyone else seem to it worry he this inability to get the simple thing do in the course of a day he would wake up in the middle of the night and fret about it how in the world have he formerly find time to build up a business raise a family be on half a dozen board work actively on committee and either go out in the even or plow through the content of a bulge brief case be it possible that a people grow old the nature of time change could it be that it speed up for the age in some mysterious way a if a bore universe be skip through the end of the chapter just to get it over with or be the answer less metaphysical do old people work more slowly do it take a man of sixty-five long to write a letter shave clean out a barn read a newspaper than a man of thirty do man become perfectionist a they grow old polish polish reluctant to let go it might be that certain people be bear with a compulsion to complicate they life while other could live blissfully motionless almost indefinitely like lizard in the sun too indolent to blink they eye perhaps it be he misfortune or good fortune whichever way one look at it to belong to the former group and he be struggle unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demand none which be positively antagonistic to it and then again perhaps the reason why he could nt find time to do any of the thing he have plan to do after retirement read roam garden lie on he back and watch the cloud go by be because he do nt want to do they there be no compulsion behind they they could be do or leave undo and nobody really give a damn during all he busy life he have only do thing which have to be do this habit have become so fix over the year that it seem futile to do anything for which no one be wait he look at the luminous dial of he wrist watch it be five minute after four on some distant farm a rooster crow and far down the valley an associate answer he turn over impatiently and pull the sheet over he head against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn at least he could buy the equipment for he workshop thus commit action might follow he go down to mill and bradley s hardware store and buy a full set of carpenter s tool include a rotary power see and several other piece of power machinery that mr mill say be essential for babbiting and doweling whatever they be he also buy a huge square of pegboard for hang up he tool and lumber for he workbench sandpaper and glue and assorted nail level and t square and plumb line and several gadget that he have no idea how to use or what they be for there say mr mill that ll get you start good not to get everything at once add thing a you find you need em he do nt even ask the cost of this collection after all if you be go to set up a workshop you have to have the proper equipment and that be that when he return home the station wagon load with tool jinny have go with a friend to some meet in the village use the recently purchase second car he be glad it give he a chance to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage of acid comment he have make such a fuss about buy that second car that he know he be vulnerable he pile everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turn to stare at the blank stone wall that be where the pegboard would go on which he would hang he hand tool in front of it would be he workbench the old nightmare which have cause he so many wakeful hour come charge in on he once more only this time he could nt pacify it with a sleep pill and send it away how in the world do one attach a pegboard to a stone wall how do one attach anything to a stone wall for that matter after the pegboard there would be the paneling he sit down on an old box and focus on the problem perhaps one bore hole in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget but then when you stick thing into the hole why do nt they come right out again it all seem rather hopeless he turn he attention to the workbench perhaps that be the first thing to do a workbench have a heavy top and sturdy leg but how do you attach sturdy leg to a heavy top so that the whole thing do nt wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you lean on it mr mill have do some figure on a scrap of paper and give he the various kind of board and two-by-fours which properly handle would he have assure he turn into a workbench they lie on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile mr crombie poke at it gingerly with he foot how could anyone know what to do with an assortment like that perhaps he have good have someone help he put up the pegboard and build the workbench someone who know what he be about then at least he would have a place to hang he tool and something to work on after that everything should be simple he go upstairs to phone crumb to he amazement he reach he mr crumb be lay up with a bad cold he do nt seem to think that attach a pegboard to a stone wall be much of a problem and he toss off the build of the worktable equally lightly the only trouble be that he himself be tie up on the school job that be why he have nt be able to finish the porch no he do nt know of any handyman-carpenter there be nt any such thing any more carpenter all want steady work and at the moment every mother s son for twenty mile around that could hammer nail for twenty-five dollar a day be work on the school job there be a fellow name blatz over smithtown way nobody like to hire he because you never could tell when he be go to be take drink mr crumb would probably see he at lodge meet the next night if he be sober which be doubtful he d have he get in touch with mr crombie mr blatz have be at least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turn out to be the great boon that have come into mr crombie s life since he move to highfield in spite of the fact that he do nt work very fast or very long at a time and he do nt like to work at all unless mr crombie hang around and talk to he he say he be the lonely type and work in a cellar you see funny thing come out of the crack in the wall if they be nt nobody with you so mr crombie sit on a wooden box and talk in order to keep mr blatz s mind from funny thing at the same time he watch carefully to see how one attach pegboards to stone wall but mr blatz be usually stand in he line of vision and it all seem so simple that he do nt like to disclose he ignorance while mr blatz be put up the pegboards and start the workbench mr crombie tell he of this idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar mr blatz agree that this would be pretty without far discussion he appear the next morning with a pile of board stick over the end of he light truck and proceed with the paneling which he then stain and wax accord to he taste now he say we get to put in some outlet for they power tool then a couple of fluorescent lamp over the workbench an i guess we re about through down here it all do look very efficient and shipshape there be no question of that by the way say mr blatz pack he tool into a batter carrier they power tool need extra voltage i guess you know about that before you use em the light company s get to run in a heavy line and you ll need a new fuse box for the extra circuit that ai nt too bad ceptin the light company s so busy you can nt ever get em to do nothin instead of be depress by this news mr crombie be actually relieve at least the moment be postpone when he have to face the mystery of the power tool he follow mr blatz up the cellar stairs a usual mrs crombie be stand in the midst of a confusion of cook utensil mr blatz sit down in the only unoccupied kitchen chair well he say get you man fix up nice down there he oughta be able to build a new house with all they contraption mr crombie watch he wife with an anxious expression i be just sayin to he that i m all ready now for anything else you want do mr crombie could nt remember he say any such thing oh that s wonderful cry mrs crombie i have a thousand thing for you to do door that will nt open and door that will nt close and shelf and break but those be the thing i build the workshop for protest mr crombie those be the thing i can do now that i m set up i ve be wait to get these thing do for month she say we will nt live long enough if i wait for you besides which you do nt need to worry there ll be plenty more but the discussion be academic mr blatz be already take measurement for a shelf above the kitchen sink
