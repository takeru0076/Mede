traffic light to change unheeding of other people he coat open and flap a he walk he try to think of kitti of himself mainly of what conrad have try to make he believe there be nothing coherent about he think it be a succession of picture-images pass through he mind the same one different one in no apparent sequence in no logical succession the enormity of what conrad have tell he make it impossible for gilborn to accept with any degree of realism the actuality of it conrad s word have intellectual mean for he only emotionally they penetrate he not at all whoever he be and you wife be intimate gilborn remember conrad s exact word they make sense and yet they do nt he know conrad have tell he the truth it be so yet it be nt so it be nt so because it could nt be so when kitti be alive and he remember the pressure of she hand rest lightly on he arm she have be the center of he life she be the sun he the close planet orbit around she the rest of the world exist and visible yet remove for fifty-five year he have live progress towards a no-goal eat work breathe without plan without reason kitti have come along to justify everything she be he goal she be he reason he have live all he life wait for she not once in the time that he have know she have he ever consider the possibility not once not for one one-thousandth of a second of she infidelity he could not consider it now not really and so he walk aimless again the walk end inevitably right in front of he hotel build the doorman begin to nod he head automatically then remember who gilborn be what have happen to he the night before he look at gilborn with undisguised curiosity gilborn pass by he without see he he cross the lobby and ride up in the elevator lose in he own thought in the apartment itself all be still the police be no long there there be no evidence that anything be different than it have be except that kitti be nt there without take off he coat he sit in the blue chair which still face the close bedroom door at last sit there in the familiar surroundings the truth begin to sink in who he feel no anger towards kitti no sense that she have betray he who she be all he have everything he have everything he want someone have take she away from he who where there be a left-hand entry in the ledger there be a right-hand one he remember from he school day where there be a victim there be a killer who whoever he be and you wife be intimate he rise from the chair take off he coat quickly he go into the bedroom the bed still show sign of where kitti have lie gilborn stand there for a long time he look at the bed unblinkingly the bed be empty now kitti would lie in it no more he would lie in it no more gilborn wonder whether kitti have lie in that same bed with who for thirty minute stanley gilborn stand there at the end of the half-hour rack he brain think over and over again of kitti she friend she past he leave the bedroom who he could think of no answer gilborn put on he coat again before leave he take one last linger look at the apartment he know he would never see it again in the street walk a quickly a he could stanley gilborn be a lone figure on blanche jacobs kitti gilborn s death have a quite different effect for blanche kitti s death be a source of guilty but nonetheless soar happy hope in blanche s defense it must be say she be unaware of the newborn hope if anyone have ask she she would have describe herself only a nervous and worry the figure on the worksheet paper in front of she be jump and wave around so badly it be all she could do to make they out clearly enough to copy they with the typewriter she wonder whether stanley would call she want to be with he to give he the comfort and companionship she know he need she have skip she lunch hour in the fear that he might call while she be out he have nt and now she be feel sick both from concern about stanley and hunger why have nt he call man she reflect even man like stanley be unpredictable she try to think of he unpredictable action in the eleven year she have know he and discover they be nt so many after all stanley really be quite predictable that be one of the thing she like about stanley he be nt like so many other man the dentist last night for instance dinner and the movie have be fine he have take she upstairs to say good night she have invite he in for coffee it be in the kitchen a she be watch the kettle wait for the water to boil that he have grab for she without warn without give she a chance to prepare for it from behind he have put he arm on she shoulder turn she around and press she to he so close she could nt breathe late she apologize for the long scratch across he face try to explain she could nt help herself that the panic arise in she unwanted but he have nt understand when he leave she know she would never see he again stanley be nt like that she could always predict what stanley be go to do ever since she first meet he except for that one morning the morning he walk in to announce to she blush that he be marry she think she be go to die she have assume before then that one day he would ask she to marry he blanche could nt remember when she have first arrive at this conclusion she think it be sometime during the second week she work for stanley it be nothing that he say or do but it seem so natural to she that she should be work for he look forward to he eventual proposal she be thirty-one year old then she mother be already considerably concern over she daughter s future but blanche have be able to maintain a serene and assure composure in the face of she widow mother s continue carp have be able to resist she urging to date anyone who offer the slight possibility of matrimony for blanche it be only a matter of time before stanley would propose it be to be expect that stanley would be shy slow in take such a momentous step stanley go along in life she know convince that he deserve the love and faith of no woman a a result he never look for it but one day she expect he would somehow discover without she have to tell he that there be such a woman in the world a woman who be will to give he love faith and anything else a woman could give a husband indeed there be a woman who unasked have already give he love unquestionably blanche love stanley and then unexpectedly stanley make he announcement on that first day blanche literally think she be go to die or at the very least go out of she mind it might have be easy for she if kitti walker have nt be everything that blanche be not kitti be thirty year young than stanley tall than stanley pretty than stanley have any right to hope for much less expect kitti could have marry a score of man there be no reason for she to marry someone like stanley gilborn there be no need for she to marry stanley kitti have come into the office on somebody s recommendation because she need help in prepare she income tax return stanley have fill out the return and because when he be finish it be close to the lunch hour he have politely ask kitti to join he never expect she to accept blanche know all this because the door to stanley s office be open and without strain too hard she could hear everything that be say stanley have go out say he would be back in an hour he have nt come back for over two after that day blanche still do nt know exactly what have happen there be morning when stanley come in late afternoon when he leave early day when he do nt come in at all blanche know something must be cause stanley s new strange behavior but she never once connect it with kitti walker it be too unprecedented then six week after the day kitti first come into the office stanley announce he and kitti be marry somehow blanche manage to cover the stun surprise and offer she congratulations that night the two of they leave for a week s honeymoon in acapulco while they be away blanche come into the office every morning run thing a she have always run they for stanley go through the week in a daze stupor get thing do automatically out of habit for exactly one week she be able to continue in this manner on the morning of stanley s return however she strength leave she two hour of watch he serenely happy face listen to he soft hum a he bend over he penciled figure and blanche have to leave she stay away for ten day those ten day be like no other that blanche have know mostly she stay in bed she do nt tell anyone even she mother what be wrong she refuse to have a doctor insist there be nothing a doctor could do for she
