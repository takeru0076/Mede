the momoyama family have come from miyagi prefecture in the northeast of the main japanese island of honshu where there be still trace of the mysterious ainu strain the ainus be a primitive people already live on the island before the principal ancestor of the japanese come from southern asia apparently they be of caucasian blood they have white skin and blue eye all they man be bearded and many of they woman be beautiful a pitiful few of they be leave now to subsist mainly on the tourist trade and to sing they ancient tribal chant which have the same haunt sadness a the lament of the american indian most of they have be assimilate but sometimes a man in miyagi or akita prefecture be much more hairy than the average japanese and occasionally a girl will be strikingly lovely she colore warm and improve by a little of the tawny honey-in-the-sun tint of the invader from the south tommy momoyama be one of these fortunate occasion she be tall than most japanese girl and have the exquisitely willowy form of the japanese girl who be lucky enough to be tall she nose be high of bridge she complexion so pale a to be quite susceptible to sunburn and the fish and vegetable diet of she forebear have give she tooth that be white and regular and strong she mouth soft and full be something for any man to dream about she have black eye long and intriguingly tilt and the way she walk be melody she have be in japan just one week it be an alien land and she hate it intensely she be already consider put in rebellious request for duty at san diego bremerton the great lake pensacola any place the navy have a hospital with a threat to resign she commission if the request be not grant anywhere would be good than the land of she ancestor there be nothing wrong with she job tommy have be assign to the psychopathic ward there be no depressingly serious case the ward doctor sometimes team up with the chaplain to serve a a marriage counselor sometimes the navy send people back to the state to preserve a marriage but mental health a a rule be very high at present the doctor s main concern be in see to it that japanese salvage firm be not permit to operate on the hulk of warship sink too close inshore because the work involve set off nerve-shattering blast at all hour tommy be interest in psychiatry because there be much an understand nurse could do to help the patient but she suffer in she off-duty hour such a now when she sit at a table in the coffee shop at the officer club have coffee and a hamburger to sustain she until dinnertime she have change into a cocktail dress and the whole even should have be before she but already she be begin to get a tight feel at the back of she neck this be one of the navy s crossroads you find they all around the world ship from the west coast rotate on six-month tour of duty with the seventh fleet and yokosuka be the seventh fleet s principal port for maintenance upkeep and shore liberty sooner or late all the gray navy ship come in here if tommy sit long enough she would be sure to see all the young officer she have meet in san diego and long beach and she want desperately to see someone she have know back there she feel rather than see the approach of the good-looking young man he come through from the fleet bar which be stag with the ice cube tinkle in a glass he carry when he see tommy sit alone the tinkle sound stop he be perhaps a trifle tipsy have be long at sea where drink be not permit and consequently out of practice he wear a brown tweed sport jacket obviously tailor in hong kong and he be of an age that mark he a a lieutenant probably off one of the carrier an aviator there be a fifty-fifty chance perhaps that he would be unmarried and an even more slender chance that he approach would be different japan do something to a man and it be nt just japan either because the same thing apply anywhere overseas it be a if foreign duty imply and excuse license it intimate that the folk at home would never know about it and therefore why not then the young man in the brown sport jacket speak and it be no different harro girl-san he say turn on what be mean to be charm you catchee boy-furiendo maybe you likee date with i i beg you pardon tommy say out of she cold rage i do nt believe i know you and i can nt understand you quaint brand of english it be mean to be english be nt it the nice-looking young officer fall back on he heel open-mouthed and blush at least he have the decency to blush she think oh i m sorry you see i think i mean i really have no idea oh yes you have idea tommy interrupt furiously all wrong one then she jerk she thumb toward the door in a very american gesture and drop into navy slang take off fly-boy uh sorry he mutter and take off obviously feel like a fool the trouble be that there be no last satisfaction in this for tommy she feel like a fool too it have nt be this way in college or in nurse train it be nt this way in the hospital at san diego everybody have accept she for what she be a very charm girl nobody have address she in break english at any of those place nobody have suggest that she be nt american there be spanish girl who look like tommy momoyama brunette with a moorish hint of the orient in they face there be beauty from the balkan state who be similarly endow and back in the bless unite state they be regard simply a pretty woman now have be send halfway around the world on a job she have not ask for tommy be be humiliate at every turn she look around self-consciously four little japanese waitress be murder the english language at the counter yuki kobayashi happen to be one of they everybody but tommy seem to think it be charm when they call bifutek-san for a steak sandwich or kohi futotsu for one cup of coffee two other japanese girl be sit at the table both quite pretty and well groom one be with a whitehaired and dote lieutenant commander the other be with she american husband and they exceptionally appeal child see these do nothing for tommy s mood she tell herself rebelliously and with pride i be an american and so she be and would remain but she be learn that so long a she be in this country and wear civilian dress in the club there would always be transient young man who would approach she with break english there have be occasion when some of the more experience have even address she in what might have be perfectly good japanese tommy would nt know after come to america she parent have speak only english one thing be become increasingly sure she have be send to the wrong place for duty there be more to service in the navy nurse corps than the hour in the ward one have to have friend and a congenial life in after-duty hour now there be raucous male sing from the fleet bar it be terribly off key and poorly do and tommy could never admit to herself that male companionship be a very natural and important thing but all at once she feel lonesome and put-upon she finish she hamburger and drink she coffee and pay she check she get out of the coffee shop before the incident could be repeat eat while angry have give she a slight indigestion back in she live quarter at the hospital she take bicarbonate of soda and sulk then after a while she go to she mirror it be all true she certainly look japanese and perhaps she could not really blame the young man and still they do not have to be so crude in they approach there be a letter to write to she mother and she try to make it tone cheerful she promise that she would soon take a few day s leave and visit the uncle she have never see on the island of oyajima which be not very far from yokosuka and tomorrow she would take time to shop for the kimono she mother want to present to the young wife of a faculty member a a hostess gown tommy of course have never hear of a kotowaza or japanese proverb which say tanin yori miuchi and be literally translate a relative be good than stranger actually this be only another way of say that blood be thick than water doc doolittle s schedule appearance at captain s mast be a very unusual thing because the discipline dispense there be ordinarily for the young and immature and a chief be naturally expect to stay off the report but the beer hall riot in subic have be unusual too and walt perry be convince that doc have start it through some expert tactic in rabble rouse just why anybody should wish to start a riot the executive officer do nt know in he opinion doc have not grow up the lieutenant be not entirely wrong in the belief there have never be a good reason for doc doolittle to grow up he have come into the navy too young with the image of the fun-loving gun appleby before he the war find he much too early and it peril and especially it awful boredom be good forget in horseplay and elaborate practical joke and even now doc have never find any stabilize sober influence he remain young at heart with an overdeveloped sense of humor he wisecrack about the captain s indoctrination of new man take great delight in slaughter cockroach with ethyl chloride and give no think for tomorrow he be do thirty year and the navy would take care of he the job security enjoy by doc doolittle and nearly all member of the arm force be a wonderful thing actually all a man in uniform have to do be to get by he may not rise to the height but he can get by and eventually be retire doc have be under restriction to the ship since the bustard leave subic this deprive he of liberty in hong kong but he tell boat mccafferty that hong kong be a book he have read before and the navy would always bring he there again some day at yokosuka he be restrict to the confine of the base because walt perry be thoughtful know that doc might have to draw some medical supply from the hospital or the supply base this give doc the whole range of the naval establishment and suit he quite well there be two thing he want to do inspect one of the many cave that have be dig into the hill on the naval base and visit an old shipmate a telephone line have be hook up to connect the ship with the base exchange after supper doc call whitey gresham who be
