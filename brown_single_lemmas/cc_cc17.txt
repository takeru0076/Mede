the read public the theatergoing public the skindiving public the horse-playing public all these and other fill substantial role in we life but none be so vary vast and vigilant a the eat public the department of agriculture average out we food consumption last year at 1488 lb per person which allow for the 17 million american that john kennedy say go to bed hungry every night mean that certain glutton on the upper end must somehow down 8 lb or more a day that mother hen of the weight-height table the metropolitan life insurance co cluck that 48 million american be overweight through previous century eat change by nearly imperceptible degree and mostly toward just get enough now big force buffet food for the first time in history the we have produce a society in which less than one-tenth of the people turn out so much food that the government s most embarrass problem be how to dispose inconspicuously of 100 million ton of surplus farm produce in this same society the plain citizen can with an average of only one-fifth he income buy more calory than he can consume refrigeration automate process and package conspire to defy season and banish spoilage and in the wake of the new affluence and the new technique of process come a new american interest in how what people eat affect they health to eat be human the nation be learn to think to survive divine fad fact not all the concern for health be well direct from the fusty panacea of spinach egg and prune the we have progress to curd concentrate and capsule each year report the american medical association ten million american spend $ 900 million on vitamin tonic and other food supplement at juice bar in los angeles 35 health store a new sensation be a pink high-protein cocktail concoct of dry egg powder milk and cherry-flavored no-cal which sell for 59-cents per 8-oz glass grocery store sell dozens of food that boast of have almost no food value at all but a big part of the public want to know fact about diet and health and a big group of we scientist want to supply they the man most firmly at grip with the problem be the university of minnesota s physiologist ancel key 57 inventor of the wartime k for key ration and author of last year s bestselling eat well and stay well from he birch-paneled office in the laboratory of physiological hygiene under the university s football stadium in minneapolis we get a rumble on every touchdown blocky grey-haired dr key direct an ambitious $ 200000-a-year experiment on diet which span three continent and seven nation and be still grow pursue it he have log 500000 mile suffer indescribable digestive indignity and meticulously collect physiological data on the health and eat habit of 10000 individual from bantu tribesman to italian contadini he have measure the skinfolds the fleshy area under the shoulder blade of neapolitan fireman study the metabolism of finnish woodcutter analyze the mealie-meal eat by capetown coloreds and experiment on minneapolis businessman and fat key s finding though far from complete be likely to smash many an eat cliche vitamin egg and milk begin to look like food to hold down on though mother milk be still the ticket reading of the number of milligram of cholesterol in the blood which seem to have value in predict heart attack be become a routine a the electrocardiogram which can show that the heart have suffer a symptomatic attack already many an american know he count and rejoice or worry depend on whether it be near 180 safe or 250 dangerous out of cholesterol come key s main message so far american eat too much the typical we daily menu say dr key contain 3000 calory should contain 2300 and extra weight increase the risk of cancer diabetes artery disease and heart attack american eat too much fat with meat milk butter and ice cream the calorie-heavy we diet be 40 % fat and most of that be saturate fat the insidious kind say dr key that increase blood cholesterol damage artery and lead to coronary disease obesity a malnutrition throughout much of the world food be still so scarce that half of the earth s population have trouble get the 1600 calory a day necessary to sustain life the deficiency disease scurvy tropical sprue pellagra run rampant in west africa for example where meat be a luxury and baby must be wean early to make room at the breast for late arrival a childhood menace be kwashiorkor or red johnny a growth-stunting protein deficiency sign reddish hair bloated belly that kill more than half it victim leave the rest prey for parasite and linger tropical disease in the well-fed we deficiency disease have virtually vanish in the past 20 year today a harrison s principle of internal medicine a standard internist s text put it the most common form of malnutrition be caloric excess or obesity puritan new england regard obesity a a flagrant symbol of intemperance and thus a sin say key maybe if the idea get around again that obesity be immoral the fat man would start to think moral aside the fat man have plenty to worry about over and above the fact that no one any long love he the simple mechanical strain of overweight say new york s dr norman jolliffe can overburden and damage the heart for much the same reason that a chevrolet engine in a cadillac body would wear out sooner than if it be in a body for which it be build the fat man have trouble buy life insurance or have to pay high premium he have for unclear reason a 25 % high death rate from cancer he be particularly vulnerable to diabetes he may find even moderate physical exertion uncomfortable because excess body fat hamper he breathe and restrict he muscular movement physiologically people overeat because what dr jolliffe call the appestat be set too high the appestat which adjust the appetite to keep weight constant be locate say jolliffe in the hypothalamus near the body s temperature sleep and water-balance control physical exercise raise the appestat so do cold weather in moderate dose alcohol narcotizes the appestat and enhance appetite the original reason for the cocktail but because liquor have a high caloric value 100 calory per oz the heavy drinker be seldom hungry in rare case disease such a encephalitis or a pituitary tumor may damage the appestat permanently destroy nearly all sense of satiety food for frustration far more frequently overeat be the result of a psychological compulsion it may be foster by frustration depression insecurity or in child simply by the desire to stop an anxious mother s nag some family place undue emphasis on food conversation center on it and rich delicacy be offer a reward withhold a punishment the result say jolliffe the child gain the feel that food be the purpose of life food may act a a sedative give temporary emotional solace just a for some people alcohol do report dr key a fairly common experience for we be the wife who find she husband stay out more and more he may be interest in another woman or just like be with the boy so she fish around in the cupboard and haul out a chocolate cake it s a matter of boredom and the subconscious feel that she be entitle to something because she s be deprive of something else for the army of compulsive eater from the nibbler and the gobblers to the downright glutton reduce be a war with the will that be rarely win physiologist key flatly dismiss such appetite depressant a the amphetamine benzedrine dexedrine a dangerous crutch for a weak will key have no such objection to metrecal quaker oats s quota and other 900-calorie milk formula that be currently win favor from dieter metrecal be a pretty complete food he say it contain large amount of protein vitamin and mineral in the quantity of 900 calory a day anyone will lose weight on it 20 30 or 40 lb but key worry that the metrecal drinker will never make either the psychological or physiological adjustment to the idea of eat small portion of food that remarkable cholesterol despite he personal distaste for obesity disgusting dr key have only an incidental interest in how much american eat what concern he much more be the relationship of diet to the nation s no 1 killer coronary artery disease which account for more than half of all heart fatality and kill 500000 american a year twice the toll from all variety of cancer five time the death from automobile accident cholesterol the cornerstone of dr key s theory be a mysterious yellowish waxy substance chemically a crystalline alcohol scientist assume that cholesterol from the greek chole mean bile and sterios mean solid be somehow necessary for the formation of brain cell since it account for about 2 % of the brain s total solid weight they know it be the chief ingredient in gallstone they suspect it play a role in the production of adrenal hormone and they believe it be essential to the transport of fat throughout the circulatory system but they can not fully explain the process of it manufacture by the human liver although the fatty protein molecule carry in the blood and partly compose of cholesterol be water soluble cholesterol itself be insoluble and can not be destroy by the body a remarkable substance say dr key quite apart from it tendency to be deposit in the wall of artery when thus deposit key say that cholesterol be mainly responsible for the arterial blockage that culminate in heart attack explain key a the fatty protein molecule travel in the bloodstream they be deposit in the intima or inner wall of a coronary artery the protein and fat be burn off and the cholesterol be leave behind a cholesterol pile up it narrow irritate and damage the artery encourage formation of calcium deposit and slow circulation eventually say key one of two thing happen a clot form at the site seal off the flow of blood to the heart and provoke a heart attack or more commonly think key the deposit themselves get so big that they choke off the artery s flow to the point that an infarct occur the heart muscle be suffocate cell supply by the artery die and the heart be permanently perhaps fatally injure fat & coronary ordinarily the human liver synthesize only enough cholesterol to satisfy the body s need for transportation of fat and for production of bile even egg and other cholesterol-rich food eat in normal amount say dr key do not materially affect the amount of cholesterol in the blood but fatty food do during world war 2 doctor in the netherlands and scandinavia note a curious fact despite the stress of nazi occupation the death rate from coronary artery disease be slowly drop not until long after the war 1950 in fact do they get a hint of the reason that year sweden s haqvin malmros show that the sink death rate neatly coincide with increasingly severe restriction on fatty food that same year the university of california s dr laurance kinsell time oxidation rate of blood fat stumble onto the discovery that many vegetable fat cause blood cholesterol level to drop radically while animal fat cause they to rise here key and other such a dr ae ahrens of the rockefeller institute take over to demonstrate the chemical difference between vegetable and animal fat and even between different variety of each all natural food fat fall into one of three category saturate mono-unsaturated and poly-unsaturated the degree of saturation depend on the number of hydrogen atom on the fat molecule saturate fat can accommodate no more hydrogen mono-unsaturated fat have room for two more hydrogen on each molecule and the poly-unsaturated fat molecule have room for at least four hydrogen the three fat have similar caloric value about 265 calory per oz but each exert a radically different influence on blood cholesterol
