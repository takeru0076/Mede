act on it if mahzeer be alone with the prime minister he could be arrange he execution while hoag stand out here shiver in the darken street he would have to do something on he own but what the door open and three man and a woman in a sari sweep past he and down the stairs in the light interior he see other man and woman struggle into they wrap these be the early departure in half an hour the reception would be over if mahzeer be plan to set up the prime minister for muller he would have to do it in the next few minute hoag descend the stone step to the street and look up at the build wide window with many small leaded pane sweep across the upper story on the second floor he see the animate face of the party guest the scene look like a christmas card on the third floor one of the two window be light it be frame in maroon drape and no face be visible this would be mahzeer s office he and the prime minister would be back from the window seat at mahzeer s desk they would be go over paper mahzeer have save a excuse for just such a meet in a minute or five minute the business would be do mahzeer would stand up the prime minister would follow mahzeer would direct the prime minister s attention to something out the window and would guide he forward and then step to one side the single shoot would come hoag would carry it sound to he grave mahzeer of course would be desolate how be he to suspect that an assassin have be lurk somewhere across the street wait for just such a chance hoag turn where across the street where be muller wait with the rifle narrow four-story building run the length of the block like book tightly pack on a shelf most of they could be eliminate muller s would have to be one of the half dozen almost directly opposite the legation be generously set back from the build line if the angle of fire be too great the jut building on either side would interfere would the shoot come from a roof he run he eye along the roof coping almost at once a figure bulk up but dully glint on the dark form be the button and badge of a policeman with a cop patrol the road muller would have to be inside a build if he be here at all and not wait for the prime minister somewhere between this street and the terminal build at la guardia airport hoag cross the narrow street squeeze between park car to reach the sidewalk from this side he could see far into the legation s third-story window but he see no face the room s occupant be still seat or they have be call into the hallway by an alarm police captain if only the latter be true he walk rapidly along the building scan they facade one be a club that be out two other he rule out because all they window be light that leave three possibly four one look much like the next he climb the step of the first and open the door to the vestibule he quickly close it again he have assume that all these building have be divide into apartment but this one from a glance at the hall furnishing be obviously still a function town house and it owner be in residence that make it doubtful a the hide place of a man whose plan have to be make in advance he go on to the next build and find what he expect the mingle cook aroma of a public vestibule on one wall be the brass front of a row of mailbox there be six apartment now what the name on the mailbox mean nothing to he this be senseless he have no idea what to look for he peer in the box themselves all be empty except one and that one be jam with letter and magazine the occupant of apartment number 3 be probably away for a few day and not likely to return on a friday have muller make the same deduction muller be attract to the lore of mailbox he open the inner door the cook odor be strong all over the city at this hour housewife would be fuss over stove he climb a quickly a he could urge he body up the two unbroken flight to the third floor pull himself along on a delicate balustrade all that remain of the build s beauty he pause on the land to steady he breathe and then bend to examine the single door by the light of the weak bulb overhead now he be certain the lock have not yield to muller s collection of key fresh scar show that the door have be prize open it have be shut again but the lock be break he note with a thrill of fear that the door move under he touch what be he to do now he have think no far than find muller he realize now he have more than half hope he would nt find he that muller would not be here that the attempt would be schedule for somewhere beyond hoag s control he could not break in on an arm man he would have to climb back down to the street and signal a cop be there time he thought be scatter by the sharp report of a rifle from the other side of the door hoag push open the door at the far end of the long dark room muller be faintly silhouette against the window the rifle still raise he stand with he foot apart on a kitchen table he have drag to the sill he turn he head to the source of the disturbance and instantly back to the window and he rifle sight dismiss hoag for the moment with the same contempt he have show in they encounter at hoag s apartment hoag stretch he leave hand to the wall and fumble for the switch evil flourish in the dark the room be bathe in light at the instant muller s second shoot come muller nakedly expose at the bright window like a deer pin in a car s headlight throw down the rifle and turn to jump from the table he face wear a look of outrage a shoot catch he and straighten he up in scream pain a follow volley of shot shatter glass rip the ceiling and send he lurch heavily from the table he be dead before he body make contact with the floor hoag stumble back into the hall lean against the wall and start to retch after captain docherty send arleigh griffith for hoag he be able to complete he detail inspection of the third floor and to receive a report from he man cover the floor above before griffith return buoy up by a brief stop for another glass of champagne
