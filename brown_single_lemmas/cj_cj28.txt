thus it be reasonable to believe that there be a significant difference between the two group in they performance on this task after a brief structure experience it be predict that kohnstamm-negative subject would adhere to more liberal concretistic report of what the ambiguous figure look like a reflect they hesitancy about take chance this be true mostly of those kohnstamm-negative subject who do not perceive the ambiguous figure a people in action response such a rope with a loop in it and two piece of rope be quite characteristic guilford-martin personality inventory the three personality inventory guilford guilford-martin guilford-martin be fill out by 12 of the kohnstamm-positive subject and 19 of the kohnstamm-negative subject these be the same subject who be give the rorschach test some prediction have be make concern factor r n i and co on these inventory which appear to be directly relate to control and security aspect of personality function which be hypothesize a be of importance in differential kohnstamm reactivity only co differentiate between the two group at less than the 5 % level afj one prediction have be make about the difference in security or self-confidence between those subject who shift they kohnstamm reactivity when inform and those who do not the nonreactors have be separate into two group on this assumption with the presumably secure nonreactors and secure reactor be use a the group for comparative personality study it be predict that those who shift in they kohnstamm reactivity would differ significantly from those who do not on the factor i which the investigator refer to a the inferiority factor all of the subject in the kohnstamm-negative and kohnstamm-positive group a define for purpose of the personality study be compare with those subject who shift in condition 3 or 4 a t test on these two group shifter vs nonshifters give a t value of 2405 which be significant on the two-tail test at the level discussion individual difference individual difference in kohnstamm reactivity to control kohnstamm situation be find among the subject use in the study only 27 % 11 subject give a positive kohnstamm reaction when completely naive concern the phenomenon there be 49 % 20 subject who do not give a positive reaction even after they be inform of the normalcy of such a reaction and have be give a demonstration there be 24 % 10 subject who shift from a negative to a positive reaction after they be reassure a to the normalcy of the kohnstamm-positive reaction among this latter group there be also difference in the amount and kind of information necessary before a shift in reaction occur one subject change when give only the information that some people have something happen to they arm when they relax five subject 12 % do not change until they have be tell that some people have something happen to they arm what that something be and also be give a demonstration four subject 10 % do not change even then but need the additional information that an arm-elevation under these circumstance be a perfectly normal reflex reaction which some people show while other do not at no time be it imply by the experimenter that the subject s initial reaction be deviant the subject be only give information about other possibility of normal reaction those who respond with an arm-elevation in the naive state do not change they reaction when tell that there be some normal people who do not react in this fashion this information be accept with the frequent interpretation that those person who do not show arm-levitation must be prevent it these subject imply that they too could prevent they arm from rise if they try the positive kohnstamm reactivity in condition 1 the naive state be not adequately explain by such a concept a suggestibility if suggestibility be define a the influence on behavior by verbal cue in no way either verbally or behaviorally do the experimenter indicate to the subject any prefer mode of respond to the voluntary contraction moreover when the experimenter do inform those subject that there be some normal people who do not have they arm rise once they relax the kohnstamm-positive subject be uninfluenced in they subsequent reaction to the kohnstamm situation they continue to give an arm-elevation a differential suggestibility would have to be invoke to explain the failure of this additional information to influence the kohnstamm-positive reactor and yet attribute they naive kohnstamm reactivity to suggestion autosuggestibility the reaction of the subject in such a way a to conform to he own expectation of the outcome ie that the arm-rise be a reaction to the pressure exert in the voluntary contraction because of he knowledge that to every reaction there be an equal and opposite reaction also seem inadequate a an explanation for the follow reason 1 the subject apparently genuine experience of surprise when they arm rise and 2 manifestation of the phenomenon despite anticipation of something else happen eg of become dizzy and maybe fall an expectation spontaneously volunteer by one of the subject a suggestion hypothesis also seem inadequate a an explanation for those who shift they reaction after they be inform of the possibility of normal reaction different from those which they give while they be tell that there be some normal people who react differently than they have they be also inform that there be other normal who react a they have there be no implication make that they initial reaction absence of an arm-elevation be less prefer than the presence of levitation a more tenable explanation for the change in reaction be that the add knowledge and increase familiarity with the total situation make it possible for these subject to be less guard and to relax since any reaction seem acceptable to the examiner a normal the naive state condition 1 could therefore be view a an inhibit one for 24 % of the subject in this study they be not free to be themselves in this situation an interpersonal one where there be an observer of they reaction and they have no guide for acceptable behavior instruction to relax ie to be spontaneous and react immediately to whatever impulse they might have be not sufficiently reassure until some idea of the possibility of normal reaction have be give while other condition might be even more effective in bring about a change from immobility to mobility in kohnstamm reactivity it be we hypothesis that all such condition would have a a common factor the capacity to induce an attitude in the subject which enable he to divorce himself temporarily from feeling of responsibility for he behavior alcohol ingestion succeed in change immobility to mobility quite strikingly in one pilot subject the only one with whom this technique be try this subject who have be undergo psychoanalytic psychotherapy for five year do not give a positive kohnstamm reaction under any of the four standardize condition use in this experiment while sober after two drink contain alcohol she arm fly upward very freely there be evident delight on the part of the subject in response to she experience of the freedom of movement she describe herself a have the same kind of irresponsible feel a she have once experience under hypnosis she ascribe she delight with both experience to the effect they seem to have of temporarily remove from she the control which she feel so compulsively necessary to maintain even when it might seem appropriate to relax these control many subject attribute difference in kohnstamm reactivity to difference in degree of subjective control voluntary a the kohnstamm-positive subject perceive it and involuntary a the kohnstamm-negative subject perceive it these suggest interpretation be give by the subject spontaneously when they be tell that there be people who react differently than they have the kohnstamm-positive subject describe the vivid experience of have they arm rise a one in which they exercise no control they explain it absence in other on the basis of an intervention of control factor they feel that they too could counteract the upward arm movement by a voluntary effort after they have once experience the reaction some of those who do not initially react with an arm-elevation also associate they behavior in the situation with control factor an inability to relinquish control voluntarily one subject spontaneously ask after she arm have finally rise do you suppose i be unconsciously keep it down before another say that she arm do not go up at first because i would nt let it i think it be nt suppose to this subject be one who give an arm-elevation on the second trial in the naive state but not in the first she have feel that she arm want to go up in the first trial but have consciously prevent it from so do she explain nonreactivity of other by say that they be not let themselves relax when inform that there be some person who do not have they arm go up she comment i do nt see how they can prevent it in contrast to this voluntary-control explanation for nonreactivity give by the kohnstamm-positive subject the kohnstamm-negative subject offer an involuntary-control hypothesis to explain nonreactivity they feel that they be relax a much a they could and that any control factor which might be present to prevent response must be on an unconscious level the above discussion do not mean to imply that control factor be completely in abeyance in the kohnstamm-positive subject but rather that they could be diminish sufficiently not to interfere with arm-levitation one kohnstamm-positive subject who have both arm rise while be test in the naive condition describe she subjective experience a follow you feel they re go up and you re on a stage and it s not right for they to do so and then you think maybe that s what s suppose to happen she then describe she experience a one in which she first have difficulty accept for herself a state of be in which she relinquish control however she be able to relax and yield to the moment it be we hypothesis that kohnstamm-positive subject be less hesitant about relinquish control than be kohnstamm-negative subject that they can give up they control and allow themselves to be reactor rather than actor it be we belief that this readiness to relinquish some control be evidence by the kohnstamm-positive subject in some of the other experimental situation to be discuss below thus this readiness to relax control evidence in the kohnstamm situation appear to be a more general personality factor aniseikonic illusion the kohnstamm-positive subject seem to be free to experience the unusual and seemingly impossible in the external world there be a significantly great number in this group who report a desk a be in a tilt position while a tennis ball rest on it remain stationary on the incline this occur in spite of the rational awareness that the ball should be go downhill they know that they perceptual experience differ from objective reality since they have see the desk and ball prior to put on the aniseikonic lense yet they be not so bind by past experience and constriction a to deny they immediate perception and to be dominate by they knowledge of what the experience should be the change in perception by some of the kohnstamm-negative subject after they have be inform of the possibility of normal reaction suggest that they constriction and guardedness be associate with they general mode of respond to strange or unknown situation they be able to experience at first in term of past conventionality when inform a to the various possibility of normal reaction they be then able to experience the uniqueness of the present it might be postulate that these subject be unduly afraid of be wrong that they perceive new internal and environmental situation a threaten until they be test and prove otherwise while the interpretation that have be give be inference only they gain support from such comment a the follow which be make by one of the kohnstamm-negative subject who do not on the first trial perceive the tilt illusion
