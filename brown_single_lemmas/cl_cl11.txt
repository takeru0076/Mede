 right say the fingerprint man also if you re go to believe those print you ll have to look for a killer who s a top-grade piano player he demonstrate by play an imaginary piano do a staccato passage with a broadly exaggerate attack to make it clear he shift to act out but with no change of manner the kill of rise mallory he hand snatch at an imaginary bucket swoop down hard to grab it and come away with equal snap like a ball that s be bounce hard in the same way he pantomime grasp a mantel and bounce cleanly off that press he hand against the floor and bounce cleanly off that he be move like a ballet dancer play for laugh if rise mallory s killer act this way catch up with he be go to be a cinch we d know he by he stretch pants and the flower he d wear twine in he hair perhaps if felix have first come upon we when this boy be not cavort so gaily up and down the hall outside the murder woman s apartment we might have have less trouble convince felix of we seriousness this you will remember be still new year s day by the time felix turn up it be early afternoon which one would think would be late enough so that by then except for small child and a few hardy soul who have not yet sober up it could have be expect that people would no long be have any sort of active interest in the previous night s noisemakers and paper hat felix be the exception he have retain he hat and he horn and whatever fun might still be go he be ready to join it that incidentally might give you some idea of what felix be like after all he have nt happen upon we in that second-floor hall without warn the i s boy have finish they on-the-spot examination and the body have be remove for autopsy the meat wagon therefore be not out in front of the house any more but the cluster of squad car be still there and there be a cop on the door downstairs to screen any coming and going there be furthermore the crowd of curious onlooker gather in the street and a couple more cop to hold they at a decent distance just put yourself in felix s place for a moment you re a taxpayer householder landlord you ve be away from home for the new year festivity but now the party be over and you come home define sobriety in the limit sense of be free from the clinical symptom of the effect of alcohol ingest and not yet eliminate from the system you be sober you still have you paper hat and you re wear it but then it be an extraordinary paper hat and in addition to anything else you may be you be also the sculptor who create that most peculiar dame out in the back yard it s not too much to assume that you will have a more last interest in paper hat than will mr average citizen you have you paper horn clutch in you big craggy fist and for you entrance you have plan a noisy colorful and exuberant greet to you friend and tenant you find you house a focus of public and police attention can you imagine yourself forget under the circumstance that you be approach this startle and unexpect situation so unsuitably hat and arm with a paper horn maybe one could be startle into forgetfulness you shoulder you way through the cluster of the curious and you barge up to the cop on the door you identify yourself and ask he what s go on instead of answer you he stick he head in the door and shout up the stairs get the upstairs guy he bellow the owner do i send he up then he turn back to you go on in he say they ll tell you what s cook even then a you go into the house oppress by the knowledge that something be cook and that you house have pass under this unaccountable official control could you go on forget that you still have that ridiculous hat on you head and you be still carry that childish horn in you hand what i m get at be that we be fully prepare for felix s be an odd one we d see he handiwork out in the back yard and the little he tenant have tell we of he do make he sound a little special we be not however prepare for anything like the apparition that confront we a felix come up the stairs he of course must have be equally unprepared for what confront he but nonetheless i do find he reaction startle if felix be still wear the hat and carry the horn because he d forget about they he now remember he come bound up the stairs and join the dance he adjust the hat lift the horn to he lip a though it be a flute and fall in alongside we fingerprint expert to cavort with he we man stop dead and glower at felix felix throw he head back and laugh a laugh that shake the timber of even that solidly build old house this be a bull of a man he be big-chested big-shouldered and heavy-armed he face be ruddy and heavy and unlined and when he laugh he show he tooth which be big and white and strong and unquestionably home-grown i do nt remember ever see tooth that be quite so white and at the same time quite so emphatically not denture he hair have recede most of the way to the back of he neck he have only a fringe of hair and he wear it crop short it be almost a white a he tooth for a man of he mass he be curiously short he be nt a dwarf but he be a bit of a comic figure a man with so big and so staggeringly develop a torso and such long and powerful arm be expect to stand tall than five foot five for felix it be a bit of a stretch to make even that measurement the man be just this side of be a freak we wait till he have finish laugh and that give we a few moment for take stock of he he be dress in a manner esquire might suggest for the outdoor man s country weekend dark gray sport jacket light gray slack pink flannel shirt black silk necktie he eye be clear he be freshly shave and if there have be any alcohol in he we could never have miss detect some scent of it on the massive gust of he laughter not even a whiff eventually he subside felix gibby say i he say merrily i the happy one that much latin we remember gibby say dryly you always live up to you name always like this always make happy i try felix say blithely the world be full of bloke who put they heart into make the tragic scene i ve never notice that it improve thing any bully for you gibby say what s the rest of you name no rest of it felix be all there be all there ever be the past i leave to historian felix intone demonstrate that he could be pompous a well a happy you live in the present in the present felix proclaim for the future be there any other time in which a man can live we gibby announce be not philosopher we be assistant district attorney this gentleman be a police officer he be a fingerprint specialist could you future you immediate future be make to include take we upstairs give we a bit of space in which we friend can work and make available to he you finger tip the happy one could never have look happy this be more than joy it be ecstasy those lovely whorl he chortle so intricate so beautiful come right along i love fingerprint he be prance along the hall head for the next flight of stairs gibby call he back we re here because of what happen last night he say past yes but important since it be important for the record let s have the full name that important felix ask that important grubb felix whisper felix grubb gibby ask not bother to whisper shh felix implore i can nt see what would make it necessary for you to know nothing could make it necessary to proclaim it to the whole world obligingly gibby lower he voice felix grubb he repeat no edmund but not for year for year it s be just felix first thing i do after i twenty-first birthday be go into court and have it officially change and this be something i do nt tell everybody that be almost forty year ago have volunteer that he be a man of about sixty he bound up the stairs and with each leap render the number less credible this be a broth of a boy we felix and nothing be more obvious than the joy he take in demonstrate how agile he be and how full of juice and spirit we follow he up the stairs the cop would gather up connor and the foursome on the third floor and bring we those of they who would voluntarily submit to fingerprint you may think we do nt need nancy and jeans but you always get what you can when you can and we have no guarantee that a fingerprint record on they could nt be useful before we be through with this case also if we have exclude the lady we would have to that extent let the whole world know at least that much of where we stand the killer if in we present group would certainly be interest in know that much and even though with the fingerprint evidence what it be i could see no way he could use this bit of information to improve on he situation there might always be some way if you can possibly avoid it you do nt hand out any extra chance felix take we into he studio it be that oddly shape space at the very top of the house where ceiling height have to accommodate themselves to the vary angle of roof slope at each angle of it pitch a big skylight have be fit into the roof and all these skylight be fit with system of multiple screen and shade when felix first open the door on it all these shade be tightly draw and the whole studio be a dark a night he quickly fix that roll back the shade on some of the skylight and adjust screen on the other he fly about the place make these adjustment and it be obvious that what he be do be the fruit of long experience none of he movement be tentative there be no process of trial and error start with the room completely black out a it be when we come in he unerringly fix thing so that the whole place be bathe in the maximum of light without at any point admit even so much a a crack of glare expect something more-than-average wacky i be surprise by what we find there be no display of either work in progress or of finish work here and there on work table or pedestal stand a shape with a sheet or a tarpaulin drape over it these shape might have be mad but there be no tell they be all completely shroud the equipment be solid and heavy and in good condition everything be orderly and it seem to be arrange for the workman s comfort convenience and efficiency there be tool about but they be neatly keep there be no confusion and no litter supply of sheet metal be neatly stack in bin
