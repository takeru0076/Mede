the person who leave the buggy there have never be identify it be a busy street conveniently near the shop center and unattended horse and wagon be often leave at the curbside there be of course many weakness in any case against emma she do nt like she stepmother but nothing be know to have occur shortly before the crime that could have cause such a murderous rage she have no way of know in advance whether an opportunity for murder exist she would have be take more than a fair risk of be see and recognize during she travel if she avoid the train and hire a buggy the stableman might have recognize she if police have check on she more thoroughly than be indicate she would be completely eliminate a a suspect uncle john vinnicum morse be the immediate popular suspect he sudden unannounced appearance at the borden home be strange in that he do not carry an iota of baggage with he although he clearly intend to stay overnight if not long lizzie state during the inquest that while she father and uncle be in the sit room the afternoon before the murder she have be disturb by they voice and have close she door even though it be a very hot day it be evident that lizzie do not tell everything she overhear between she father and she uncle morse at that time jennings have a young law associate name arthur s phillips a few year ago not too long before he death phillips reveal in a newspaper story that he have always suspect morse of the murder he say morse and borden have quarreled violently in the house that day information which must have come from lizzie it be obviously the sound of this argument that cause lizzie to close she door the new bedford standard-times have report knowlton a say long after the trial that if he only know what borden say during he conversation with morse he would have convict somebody notice knowlton do not say that he would have obtain a conviction in the trial of lizzie borden he say he would have convict somebody it be know that morse do associate with a group of itinerant horse trader who make they headquarters at westport a town not far from fall river they be a vagabond lot and consider to be shady and undesirable character fall river police do go to westport to see if they could get any information against morse and possibly find an accomplice whom he might have hire from among these man these officer find no incriminate information morse s alibi be not a solid a it seem he say he return from the visit to he niece on the 1120 streetcar the woman in the house where the niece be stay back up he story and say she leave when he do to shop for she dinner fall river be not a fashionable town the dinner hour there be twelve noon if this woman have delay until after 1120 to start she shop she would have have little time in which to prepare the substantial meal that be eat at dinner in those day it be possible that morse tell the woman it be 1120 but it could have be early since she do serve dinner on time police do make an attempt to check on morse s alibi they interview the conductor of the streetcar morse say he have take but the man do not remember morse a a passenger question far morse say that there have be four or five priest ride on the same car with he the conductor do recall have priest a passenger and this satisfy police although the conductor also point out that in heavily catholic fall river there be priest ride on almost every trip the streetcar make so morse s statement really prove nothing we do know that morse leave the house before nine oclock bridget testify she see he leave through the side door morse say borden let he out and lock the screen door from that point on he say he go to the post office and then walk leisurely to where he niece be stay more than a mile away he meet nobody he know on this walk there be no account of he movement in this long gap of time which cover the early hour when mrs borden be kill morse testify that while he be have breakfast in the dine room mrs borden tell the servant bridget i want you to wash these window today bridget s testimony be in direct contradiction she say it be after she return from she vomit spell in the back yard that mrs borden tell she to wash the window this be long after morse have leave the house morse s knowledge of what mrs borden tell bridget could indicate that he have return secretly to the house and be hide there he know the house fairly well he have be there on two previous visit during the past three or four month alone and despite knowlton s attempt to show that the house be lock up tight than a drum this be not true the screen door be unlock for some ten or fifteen minute while bridget be sick in the back it be unlock all the time she be wash window morse could have return openly while bridget be sick in the back yard and go up to the room he have occupy mrs borden would not have be alarm if she see morse with an ax or hatchet in he hand he have be to the farm the previous day and he could have say they need the ax or hatchet at the farm mrs borden would have have no reason to disbelieve he and he could have approach close enough to she to swing before she could cry out he could have leave for weybosset street after she murder and make it in plenty of time by use the streetcar if he take an early streetcar than the 1120 on he return he could have arrive at the borden house shortly after mr borden come home with lizzie in the barn the screen door unlock and bridget upstairs in she attic room he would have have free and easy access to the house with the second murder over he could have leave hide the weapon in some vacant lot or an abandon cistern in the neighborhood he unconcerned stroll down the side of the house to a pear tree with crowd already gather in front of the build and sawyer guard the side door be odd there be no close examination of he clothe for bloodstain and certainly no scientific test be make of they and for a man who travel around without any change of clothing a few more stain on he dark suit may very well have go unnotice the motive may have be the mysterious quarrel there be no financial gain for morse in the murder on the other side of the ledger be the fact that he do see he niece and the woman with whom she be stay the time would have be shortly after the murder of mrs borden and they notice nothing unusual in he behavior he say he have promise mrs borden to return in time for dinner and that be close to the time when he do turn up at the borden house what do pearson say about bridget sullivan a a possible suspect in he trial-book essay he write the police soon cease to look upon either bridget or mr morse a in possession of guilty knowledge neither have any interest in the death indeed it be probably to mr morse s advantage to have mr and mrs borden alive both he and bridget be exonerate by lizzie herself that be he complete discussion of bridget sullivan a a possible suspect although pearson disbelieve almost everything lizzie say and read a sinister purpose into almost everything she do he happily accept she statement about bridget a the whole truth he feel nothing far need be say about the servant girl the exoneration pearson speak of be not an exoneration but lizzie s expression of she opinion a report in the testimony of assistant marshal fleet this officer have ask lizzie if she suspect she uncle morse and she reply she do nt think he do it because he leave the house before the murder and return after they fleet ask the same question about bridget and lizzie point out that a far a she know bridget have go up to she room before she father s murder and come down when she call she lizzie actually never name any suspect she tell police about the prospective tenant she have hear quarreling with she father some week before the murder but she say she think he be from out of town because she hear he mention something about talk to he partner and much a she detest hiram harrington she also do not accuse he at the inquest she be ask specifically whether she know anybody she father have bad feeling toward or who have bad feeling toward she father she reply i know of one man that have not be friendly with he they have not be friendly for year ask who this be she name harrington she statement certainly be true the press report the same fact in use harrington s interview but lizzie do not suggest at the inquest that harrington be the killer when i interview kirby who a a boy pick up pear in the borden yard i ask if anybody else in the household besides lizzie and morse have be under any suspicion at the time of the murder he say he have not hear of anybody else how about bridget sullivan i inquire oh she be just the maid there he reply wave a hand to indicate how completely unimportant she be kirby be of course reflect the opinion that exist at the time of murder everyone somehow manage to overlook completely the fact that a far a we know there be exactly two people in and about the house at the time of both murder lizzie borden and bridget sullivan all the official on the case seem to have be afflict with a similar myopia a far a bridget be concern although record in police file contain many report of servant who have murder they employer true it be no long cricket for the butler to be the killer in mystery fiction but we be deal here with actual people in real life and not imaginary character and situation the action of bridget should be examine since she be there and opportunity do exist if only to establish she innocence there be also other factor that require close examination the legend a it exist in fall river today always include the solemn assurance that bridget return to ireland after the trial with a big bundle of cash which lizzie give she for keep she mouth shut the people who believe and retell the legend have apparently never trouble to read the trial testimony and do not know that the maid change she testimony on several key point always to the detriment of lizzie if bridget do get any bundle of cash the last person who would have reward she for service render would have be lizzie borden bridget be bear in ireland one of fourteen child she be apparently the pioneer in she family because she have no close relative in this country at that time she work a a domestic first in newport for a year and then in south bethlehem pennsylvania for another year she finally settle in fall river and after be employ for a time by a mrs reed be hire by the bordens i have previously describe how during the week of the murder bridget spend the first few hot day scrub and iron clothe
