they neither like nor dislike the old man to they he could have be the break bell in the church tower which ring before and after mass and at noon and at six each even it tone repetitive monotonous never break the boredom of the street the old man be unimportant yet if he be not there they would have miss he a they would have miss the sound of bee buz against the screen door in early june or the smell of thick tomato paste the ripe smell that be both sweet and sour rise up from aluminum tray wrap in fly-dotted cheesecloth or the surge whirl sound of bat at night when they black body dive into the blackness above and below the amber street light or the bay of female dog in heat they never call he by name although he have one filippo rossi that s what he be call in the old country but here he be just signore or the old man but this be not unusual because youth in these quarter be always push at a distance from it elder youth obey when command it go to church on sunday and one saturday a month go to confession but youth ask nothing of it parent not a touch of the hand or a kiss give in pass the only thing unusual about the old man have long since happen but the past be dead here a the present be dead once the old man have have a wife and once she too ignore he with a tiny fur-piece wrap around she shoulder she wiggle she satin-covered buttock down the street before he and do nt stop in one hand she clutch a hundred dollar bill and in the other a straw suitcase the way she strut down the street the old man would have be blind not to have notice both without look at he without look at anything except drexel street directly in front of she she climb up into one of those orange streetcars ride away in it and never come back but she should nt have come here in the first place the woman have say no no not that one she think she be big than we be because she come from torino eh torino she give herself fancy air just because she have a part on the stage in the old country she think she could carry she head high than ours they have slap they thigh it s not for make pretty speech about dante those actress get pay so good henh callouse finger caress only by the smoothness of polish rosary have sway excitedly beneath pucker chin where tiny black hair sprout never to be tweezed away mauve-colored mouth that have never know anything sweet than the taste of new wine and the passion of man s tongue have not smile but have condemn again and again puttana but if the old man even think about he wife now nobody care a fig it be enough for people to know that at one time he have look down the street at the fleshy suppleness of a woman he have consume watch she become thin and thin in the distance a thin a the seam on she stocking and still thin he voice have not command she to stop it have not question why the woman say they have see he wave an exhaust farewell but he might have be shoo away the flea that hop from he yellow dog onto he he be never without that dog and he eye those miniature sundial of variegate yellow have not alter they expression or direction the old man s very soul could have leave he and fly down that street but he would nt have have anyone know it perhaps he have know then where that hundred dollar bill have come from and where it be take he wife but when he call for he wither wrinkle sister rise to care for he and the child have he guess that all he would remember of he woman be the memory of she climb into that streetcar there seem to be a contemptuous purpose in the way he sit there with he eye glue to drexel street and he back in opposition to the church behind he for all he see or care to see this could have be a town in italy not the outskirts of philadelphia it could have be bari or chieti for the way it smell what do it matter to he that the park at the foot of ash road stretch beneath elevate train that roar from the stucco station into the city s center at half-hour interval or that the tiny creek spin it silent course toward the schuylkill this place be hatred to he just a hatred be he only companion in he aloneness to he they be one and the same sameness for the old man be frame in by a wall of ginkgo tree which divide these quarter from the city sameness line the street with two-story house the color of ash it slash the slope manure-scented lawn with concrete step which climb upward to white wooden porch it sway with the wicker swing and screech with the rust hinge of screen door even the stable-garage which house nothing now but the scent of rot have a lawn before it and the coffee shop on drexel street where the man spend they evening and sunday play card have a rise hedge beneath it window the hedge reek of coffee dregs throw against it only one house on the street have no lawn before it it squat low and square upon the sidewalk with a heavy iron grate support a glass facade that be bartoli s shop above it from a second-story showroom wooden angel survey the neighborhood do the old man remember they there yet everywhere else sameness be stucco and wood in square block like fortress perch against the slant of the hill rise with the hill to the top where the church be and beyond that to the cemetery only pave alleyway tunneled through the wall of those fortress into the mysterious core of intimacy behind the house where backyard own no fence where one man s property blend with the next to form courtyard in which no one know privacy love and hatred and fear be one here shade only by fig tree and grape vine and the fork tongue of gossip lick it sinister way from back porch to back porch the old man silently feed upon these street they keep he alive wait wait for what and for whom only he could tell and would not it be a though he have make a pact with the devil himself but it be not yet time to pay the price he be hold out for something he be determine to hold out the old man s son throw himself down belly first upon a concrete step take in the coolness of it and dream of the day he would be rich at fifteen he do nt care that he have no mother that he could nt remember she face or she touch neither do he care that aunt rise provide for he he be name pompeii a a tribute to he heritage and he could nt have care less about that either to he life be a restless boredom that begin with the rise sun and end only with sleep when he would be a man he would be a rich man he would not be like the rich american who live in white-columned house on the other side of the park he would not ride the eight-thirty local to the city each morning he would not carry a brief case nor would he work at all he would square he shoulder and carry a cane before each step he would sit inside the coffee shop and pound a gloved fist upon the table and a girl would hear he and come run bow with she run call out in she bow at you service he would order she to bring coffee and would take from he vest pocket a thin black pipe which he would stuff he would not remove he glove and light and smoke he could do that when he would be a man hey laura he call to he sister on the porch above the step she be only ten month old than he laura what would you say if i smoke a pipe laura do not answer he she lean unconcerned against the break porch fence brush and dry she wet gild hair in the sun one lithe leg straddle the railing and swing loosely before the creak tear pale she tan foot whose arch sweep high and white point artfully toward taper toe toe like finger whose tip glow white all the while she sit there she sinewy arm swirl before she chest she face show no sign of have hear pompeii it be a face that have lose it childlike softness and be begin to fold within it fragile feature a harshness that bely the lyric line of it contour the eye blue and always somewhat downcast possess a sullen quality even though the boy could not see they he know they be cloud by distance he be never sure they fully take he in pompeii call again laura but the only answer that reach he be the screech of the porch rail from she leg move against it she s in a mood he think there s not a month she do nt get herself in a mood well what do that matter when the sun be shine and there be dream to dream about and a for he pipe if he want to smoke one nobody would stop he not even laura suddenly he be interrupt in he daydream by a warm wetness lap against he chin and he eye open wide and long at the sight of a goat s claret tongue feast against the salt taste of he above the tongue an age yellow eye sallow and time-cast encrust within a sphere of marbleized pink skin stare unfalteringly at he christ sake goat git but the goat would not you re boil milk ai nt you soothing it with he hand know the whiskered jowl and the swell smoothness of teat that wrinkle expectantly to he touch pompeii roll over he head undulate gradually cover space to come strain beneath the taut belly within the warmth of those teat with he mouth open wide he squirt the warm white milk against the roof of he mouth and he tongue savored the light earthy taste of it the boy s finger and mouth operate with the skilled unity of a bagpipe player press and pull delight in what he do above he slide the evasive shadow of a storm cloud it form be a heavy figure in a flutter soutane but the boy could see only the goat s belly the old man near the corner let the shadow pass over he sense something portentous in it he know it be there know also what it be about but he would nt raise a finger except to smooth he yellow dog s back there would be time enough perhaps the old man reassure himself to pay the devil he due time enough to give up he soul in the meantime six sandal stain an ocher the same color a pompeii s shave hair edge up close to he the clap they make on the concrete interrupt he in the ecstatic pleasure he know so that he quickly release he hold on the goat and pretend to be examine it haunch for tick he know at a glance that the big sandal belong to niobe the neat one to concetta and the lace one to romeo concetta s idiot brother pompeii expect romeo s small body to sink close and close to the ground he expect concetta s thin hand to reach down to grasp the boy and she shrill impetuous voice to sound against the rotundity of he disfigure flesh that be never sure of hear anything
