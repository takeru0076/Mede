in tradition and in poetry the marriage bed be a place of unity and harmony the partner each bring to it unselfish love and each take away an equal share of pleasure and joy at it most ecstatic moment husband and wife be elevate far above worldly care everything else be close away this be the ideal but marriage expert say that such mutual contribution and mutual joy be seldom achieve instead one partner or the other dominate the sexual relationship in the past it have be the husband who have be dominant and the wife passive but today there be sign that these role be be reverse in a grow number of american home marriage counselors report the wife be take a command role in sexual relationship it be she who decide the time the place the surroundings and the frequency of the sexual act it be she who say aye or nay to the intimate question of sexual technique and mechanic not the husband the whole act be tailor to she pleasure and not to theirs beyond a certain point of course no woman can be dominant nature have see to that but there be little doubt that in many marriage the wife be boss of the marital bed of course there remain many old-fashioned marriage in which the husband maintain he supremacy yet even in these marriage psychologist say wife be assert themselves more strongly the meek most submissive wife of today be a tiger by she mother s or grandmother s standard to many expert this trend be inevitable they consider it simply a sign of we time we society have emancipate the woman give she new independence and new authority it be only natural that she assert herself in the sexual role the sexual relationship do not exist in a vacuum declare dr mary steichen calderone medical director of the plan parenthood federation of america and author of the recent book release from sexual tension it reflect what be go on in other area of the marriage and in society itself a world in which wife have take a more active role be likely to produce sexual relationship in which wife be more self-assertive too yet many psychologist and marriage counselors agree that domination of the sex relationship by one partner or the other can be unhealthy and even dangerous it can in fact wreck a marriage when a husband be sexually selfish and heedless of he wife s desire she be cheat of the fulfillment and pleasure nature intend for she and she begin to regard he a savage bestial and unworthy on the other hand wifely supremacy demean the husband sap he self-respect and rob he of he masculinity he be a target of ridicule to he wife and often since private affair rarely remain private to the outside world a well a marriage can survive almost any kind of stress except an open and direct challenge to the husband s maleness declare dr calderone this opinion be support by one of the nation s lead psychiatrist dr maurice e linden director of the mental health division of the philadelphia department of public health when the role of husband and wife be reverse so that the wife become leader and the husband follower dr linden say the effect on they whole relationship sexual and otherwise can be disastrous in one extreme case cite by a pittsburgh psychologist an office worker s wife refuse to have sexual relation with she husband unless he buy she the luxury she demand to win she favor she husband first take an additional job then desperately begin to embezzle from he employer catch at last he be sentence to prison while he be in custody he wife divorce he more typical be the case of a suburban long island housewife describe by a marriage counselor this woman repeatedly complain she be too tire for marital relation to please she she husband assume some of the domestic chore finally he be cook wash dish bathing the child and even iron and still he wife refuse to have relation a often a he desire they one wife describe by a new york psychologist so dominate she husband that she actually place they sexual relationship on a schedule write it down right between the weekly pta meeting and the thursday-night neighborhood card party another put sex on a dollars-and-cents basis after every money argument she rebuff she husband s overture until the matter be settle in she favor expert say the partner in marriage like these can almost be type the wife be likely to be young sophisticate smart a a whip often a girl who have sacrifice a promise career for marriage she know the power of the sex urge and how to use it to manipulate she husband the husband be usually a well-educated professional preoccupy with he job often an organization man whose motto for get ahead be do nt rock the boat sometimes this lead to he become demandingly dominant in marriage hem in on the job and unable to assert himself he use the sex act so he can be supreme in at least one area more often though he be so accustom to submit to authority on the job without argument that he life by the same rule at home some psychologist in fact suggest that career-bound husband often be more to blame for topsy-turvy marriage than they wife the wife s attempt at control these psychologist contend be sometimes merely a pathetic effort to compel she husband to pay a much attention to she a he do to he job naturally no woman can ever completely monopolize the sexual initiative unless she husband also desire sex the act can not be consummate generally however in such marriage a those cite the husband be at he wife s mercy the pattern say dr morton schillinger psychologist at new york s lincoln institute for psychotherapy be for the husband to hover about anxiously and eagerly virtually tremble in he hope that she will flash he the signal that tonight be the night no one seriously contend of course that the domineer wife be sexually speak a new character in we world after all the henpeck husband with he shrewish wife be a comic figure of long stand in literature and on the stage a dr schillinger point out there be no evidence that these milquetoasts become suddenly embolden when they cross the threshhold of the master bedroom furthermore dr calderone say a certain number of docile retire man always have be around they be nt frigid and they be nt homosexual they re just restrain in all of life they like to be dominate one such man once confide to dr theodor reik new york psychiatrist that he prefer to have he wife the sexual aggressor ask why he reply primly because that s no activity for a gentleman but such case be in the past unusual society here and abroad have be build around the dominate male even the bible appear to endorse the concept family survival on we own western frontier for example could quite literally depend on a man s strength and ability to bring home the bacon and the dependent wife seldom question he judgment about anything include the marriage bed this carry over into the more urbanize late 19th and early 20th century when the man rule the roost in the good bull-roaring life with father manner in those day a wife have mighty few right in the domestic sphere and even fewer in the sexual sphere grandma be nt expect to like it dr marion hilliard the late toronto gynecologist once sum up the attitude of the 90s wife of the period shamefacedly think of themselves a use by they husband and history indicate they often quite literally be when be the turn point when do woman begin to assert themselves sexually some date it from woman suffrage other from when woman first begin to challenge man in the marketplace still other from the era of the emancipate flapper and bathtub gin virtually everyone agree however that the trend toward female sexual aggressiveness be tremendously accelerate with the postwar rush to the suburb leave alone while she husband be mile away in the city the modern wife assume more and more duty normally reserve for the male circumstance give she almost undisputed sway over child-rearing money-handling and home maintenance she find she could cope with all kind of problem for which she be once consider too helpless she like this taste of authority and independence and with darkness be not likely to give it up very few wife say dr calderone who balance the checkbook fix the car choose where the family will live and deal with the tradesman be suddenly go to become submissive where sex be concern a woman who dominate other family affair will dominate the sexual relationship a well and an additional factor be help to make woman more sexually self-assertive the comparatively recent discovery of the true depth of female desire and response marriage manual and woman s magazine article begin to stress the importance of the female climax they begin to describe in detail the woman s capacity for response in fact the note psychologist and sex researcher dr albert ellis have declare flatly that woman be sexually superior to man accord to dr ellis the average 20-year-old american woman be capable of far great sexual arousal than she partner not surprisingly dr ellis say some recently enlighten wife be out to claim these capability yet paradoxically accord to dr maurice linden many wife despise they husband for not stand up to they an aggressive woman want a man to demand not knuckle under when the husband become passive in the face of he wife s aggressiveness dr linden say the wife in turn find he inadequate often she fail to gain sexual satisfaction one such wife dr linden say become disgust with she weak husband and flurry through a series of extramarital affair in the hope of find a strong man but she personality be such that each affair last only until that lover too have be conquer and reduce to passivity then the wife bed-hopped to the next on the list in some case however domination of the sex act by one partner can be temporary trigger by a pass but urgent emotional need thus a man who be butt a stone wall at the office may become unusually aggressive in bed the one place he can still be champion if he on-the-job problem work out he may return to he old pattern sometimes a burst of aggressiveness will sweep over a man or he wife because he or she feel age creep up on the other hand a husband who always have be vigorous and assertive may suddenly become passive ask psychologist say for reassurance that he wife still find he desirable or a wife may make sudden demand that she be court flatter or coax simply because she need she ego lift in any case dr calderone remark such problem be a couple s own affair and can nt always be measure by a general yardstick a long a the couple be in agreement in they approach to sex it make little difference if one or the other dominate dr calderone declare the important point be that both be satisfy with the adjustment other expert say however that if sexual domination by one or the other partner exist for long than a brief period it be likely to shake the marriage and just a domination today often begin with the wife so the cure generally must lie with the husband to get a marriage back where it belong comment dr schillinger of the lincoln institute the husband must take some very basic step he must begin paradoxically by become more selfish he must become more expressive of he own desire more demand and less understand too many husband dr schillinger continue worry about how well they re do and fear that they success depend on some trick or technique of sexual play
