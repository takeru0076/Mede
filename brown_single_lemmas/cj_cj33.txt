in sentence pattern of stress be determine by complex combination of influence that can only be suggest here the tendency be toward put dominant stress at the end there be a parallel to this tendency in the assignment of time in long-known hymn tune thus the first line of one of charles wesley s hymn be a follow a charge to keep i have a god to glorify in the tune to which this hymn be most often sing boylston the syllable have and fy end they line have twice the time any other syllable have dominant stress be of course more than extend duration and normally center on syllable that would have primary stress or phrase stress if the word or long unit they be part of be speak alone a dominant stress give to glorify would normally center on it first syllable rather than it last but the parallel be significant when the answer to what s wrong now be bill s break a chair dominant stress will usually be on the complement a chair from the point of view of syntactic analysis the head word in the statement be the predicator have break and from the point of view of mean it would seem that the trouble center in the break but dominant stress will be assign to break only in rather exceptional version of the sentence in i know one thing dominant stress will usually be on the complement one thing in one thing i know it will usually be on the predicator know in small-town people be very friendly dominant stress will generally be on the complement very friendly in the double sentence the small the town the friendly the people it will generally be on the subject the town and the people in what s a linguist dominant stress will generally be on the subject a linguist in who s a linguist it will generally be on the complement a linguist dominant stress be on she luggage both in that s she luggage where she luggage be the complement and in there s she luggage where it be the subject adverbial second complement however be likely not to have dominant stress when they terminate sentence if the answer to what be that noise be george put the cat out dominant stress will ordinarily be on the first complement the cat not the second complement out final adjunct may or may not have dominant stress if the answer to what be that noise be george read the news emotionally dominant stress may or may not be on the adjunct emotionally when prepositional complement be divide a in what be you look for they be likely to lose dominant stress context be of extreme importance what be new in the context be likely to be make more prominent than what be not thus in a context in which there have be discussion of snow but mention of local condition be new dominant stress will probably be on here in it rarely snow here but in a context in which there have be discussion of local weather but no mention of snow dominant stress will probably be on snow the personal pronoun and substitute one be normally unstressed because they refer to what be prominent in the immediate context in i ll go with george dominant stress be probably on george but if george have just be mention prominently and the trip to be make have be under discussion what be say be probably i ll go with he and dominant stress be probably on the preposition with when a gesture accompany who s he the personal pronoun have dominant stress because he have not be mention previously if both george and a piece of information george do not have be prominent in the context but the idea of tell george be new then dominant stress will probably be on tell in why not tell george but when what be new in a particular context be also fairly obvious there be normally only light stress or no stress at all thus the unstressed it of it rarely snow here get it significance from it use with snow nothing can snow snow but it in there be nt many young people in the neighborhood the modifier young take dominant stress away from it head people the fact that the young creature of interest be people seem rather obvious if woman replace people it would normally have dominant stress in i have thing to do the word thing make little real contribution to mean and have weak stress than do if work be substitute for thing with more exact contribution to mean it will have dominant stress in i know one thing dominant stress be likely to go to one rather than to semantically pale thing in i know you when you be a child and you be pretty then dominant stress on then imply that the young woman speak to be still pretty dominant stress on pretty would be almost insult here in the write language then can be underline or italicize to guide the reader here but much of the time the write language simply depend on the reader s alertness and a careless reader will have to back up and reread often dominant stress simply indicate a center of attention or emotion thus in it s incredible what that boy can eat dominant stress be likely to be on incredible and eat will have strong stress also in she have it in for george dominant stress will ordinarily be on in where the notion of stored-up antipathy seem to center in we re painting at we garage strong stress on at indicate that the job be do be not real painting but simply an effort at painting where there be comparison or contrast dominant stress normally operate to center attention thus in he friend be strange than he sister strong stress be normal for he and sister but in he friend be strange than he sister strong stress be normal for friend and sister in he s hurt himself more than he s hurt you both himself and you have strong stress than they would ordinarily have if there be no contrast in be she chinese or japanese the desire to contrast the first part of word which be alike in they last component produce an exceptional disregard of the normal pattern of stress of chinese and japanese sometimes strong stress serve to focus an important secondary relationship thus in mary write an account of the trip first strong stress on mary mark mary a the first in a series of people who write account of the trip strong stress on write mark the write a the first of a series of action of mary s concern with an account of she trip about which she may late have make speech for example and strong stress on trip make the trip the first of a series of subject about which mary write account in hunger stimulate man too the situation be very similar strong stress on hunger treat hunger a an additional stimulus strong stress on stimulate treat stimulation a an additional effect of hunger strong stress on man treat man a an additional creature who respond to the stimulation of hunger here again in the write language it be possible to help the reader get he stress right by use underline or italic but much of the time there be simply reliance on he understand in the light of context when a word represent a large construction of which it be the only express part it normally have more stress than it would have in fully express construction thus when yes i have be the response to have you finish read the paper the stress on have which here represent have finish read the paper be quite strong in mack s the leader at camp but jack be here the be of the second main declarative represent be the leader and therefore have stress mack s the leader at camp but jack s here with this be deprive of stress make here the complement in the clause in of all the suggestion that be make he be the silly the possessive he represent he suggestion and be stress when go represent itself and a complement be equivalent say to go to martinique in which boat do jack go on it have strong stress when it represent only itself and on which be it complement so that go on be semantically equivalent to board on have strong stress than go do omission of a subordinator pronoun however do not result in an increase in stress on a prepositional adverb for which the subordinator pronoun would be object thus to have light stress both in that be the conclusion that i come to and in that be the conclusion i come to but when to represent to consciousness in that be the moment that i come to and similarly in that be the moment i come to there be much strong stress on to in i want to tell he but i be afraid to the final to be lightly stress because it represent to tell he in to tell he of course to be normally unstressed when i have instruction to leave be equivalent in mean to i have instruction that i be to leave this place dominant stress be ordinarily on leave when the same sequence be equivalent in mean to i have instruction which i be to leave dominant stress be ordinarily on instruction it be clear that pattern of stress sometimes show construction unambiguously in the speak language where without the help of context it would be ambiguous in the write other example follow i ll come by tuesday i can nt be happy long without drink water in the first of these sentence if by be the complement of come and tuesday be an adjunct of time equivalent to on tuesday there will be strong stress on by in the speak language but if a complement for come be imply and by tuesday be a prepositional unit use a an adjunct by will be unstressed or lightly stress at most in the second sentence if drink water be a gerundial clause and without drink water be roughly equivalent in mean to unless i drink water there will be strong stress on water than on drink but if drink be a gerundial noun modify water and without drink water be equivalent to without water for drink there will be strong stress on drink than on water but the use of stress in comparison and contrast for example can undermine distinction such a these and pattern of stress be not always unambiguous by any mean in the steiners have busy life without visit relative only context can indicate whether visit relative be equivalent in mean to pay visit to relative or to relative who be visit they and in i look up the number and i look up the chimney only the meaning of number and chimney make it clear that up be syntactically a second complement in the first sentence and a preposition follow by it object in the second syllabification syllable be linguistic unit center in peak which be usually vocalic but a have be note be consonantal under certain circumstance and which may or may not be combine with precede and follow consonant or combination of consonant syllable be genuine unit but division of word and sentence into they present great difficulty sometimes even the number of syllable be not clear doubt on this point be strong before and aab or from the point of view of word formation real might be expect to have two syllable historically re be the formative that be employ also in republic and al be the common suffix when ity be add real clearly have two syllable but there be every reason to regard deal a a monosyllable and because of the fact that commonly have the quality of aab when it follow vowel sound deal seem to be a perfectly satisfactory rhyme with deal
