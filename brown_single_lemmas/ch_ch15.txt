at the entrance side of the shelter each roof beam be rest on the inside 4 inch of the block wall the outside 4-inch space be fill by mortare block on edge the wooden brace between the roof beam be place flush with the inside of the wall mortar be pour between this brace and the 4-inch block on edge to complete the wall thickness for radiation shield for detail see inset fig 5 the first one or two roof board mark e in fig 6 be slip into place across the roof beam from outside the shelter these board be nail to the roof beam by reach up through the open space between the beam from inside the shelter concrete block be pass between the beam and put on the board the roof block be in two layer and be not mortare together work on the roof continue in this way the last roof board be cover with block from outside the shelter when the roof block be all in place the final row of wall block be mortare into position the structure be complete see fig 7 build plan be on page 21 solid concrete block relatively heavy and dense be use for this shelter these block be sell in various size so it seldom be necessary to cut a block to fit solid block be recommend because hollow block would have to be fill with concrete to give effective protection brick be an alternative if they be use the wall and roof should be 10 inch thick to give the same protection a the 8-inch solid concrete block the illustration in fig 8 show how to lie a concrete block wall more detail instruction may be obtain from you local build supply house and craftsman other source of information include the national concrete masonry association 38 south dearborn street chicago ill the portland cement association 33 west grand avenue chicago ill and the structural clay product association washington dc aboveground double-wall shelter an outdoor aboveground fallout shelter also may be build with concrete block see fig 9 double-wall shelter most people would have to hire a contractor to build this shelter plan be on page 22 and 23 this shelter could be build in region where water or rock be close to the surface make it impractical to build an underground shelter two wall of concrete block be construct at least 20 inch apart the space between they be fill with pit-run gravel or earth the wall be hold together with metal tie place in the wet mortar a the wall be build the roof show here fig 9 be a 6-inch slab of reinforce concrete cover with at least 20 inch of pit-run gravel an alternate roof perhaps more within do-it-yourself reach could be construct of heavy wooden roof beam overlay with board and waterproof it would have to be cover with at least 28 inch of pit-run gravel the material for a double-wall shelter would cost about $ 700 contractor charge would be additional the shelter would provide almost absolute fallout protection pre-shaped metal shelter pre-shaped corrugated metal section or pre-cast concrete can be use for shelter either above or below ground these be particularly suitable for region where water or rock be close to the surface they form effective fallout shelter when mound over with earth a show in figure 10 material for this shelter would cost about $ 700 a contractor probably would be require to help build it he charge would be add to the cost of material this shelter a show on page 24 would provide almost absolute protection from fallout radiation an alternate hatchway entrance show on page 25 would reduce the cost of material $ 50 to $ 100 the national lumber manufacturer association washington dc be develop plan to utilize specially treat lumber for underground shelter construction the structural clay product institute washington dc be work to develop brick and clay product suitable for shelter construction underground concrete shelter an underground reinforce concrete shelter can be build by a contractor for about $ 1000 to $ 1500 depend on the type of entrance the shelter show would provide almost absolute fallout protection the illustration fig 11 show this shelter with the roof at ground level and mound over the same shelter could be build into an embankment or below ground level plan for the shelter with either a stairway or hatchway entrance be show on page 26 and 27 another type of shelter which give excellent fallout protection can be build a an add room to the basement of a home under construction it would add about $ 500 to the total cost of the home the shelter illustrate in figure 12 be base on such a room build in a new home in the washington dc area in the spring of 1959 important consideration common to each type of shelter be 1 arrangement of the entrance 2 ventilation 3 radio reception 4 light the entrance must have at least one right-angle turn radiation scatter somewhat like light some will go around a corner the rest continue in a straight line therefore sharp turn in a shelter entrance will reduce radiation intensity inside the shelter ventilation be provide in a concrete block basement shelter by vent in the wall and by the open entrance a blower may be install to increase comfort a blower be essential for the double-wall shelter and for the underground shelter it should provide not less than 5 cubic foot per minute of air per person vent pipe also be necessary a show in fig 9 10 and 11 but filter be not radio reception be cut down by the shield necessary to keep out radiation a soon a the shelter be complete a radio reception check must be make it probably will be necessary to install an outside antenna particularly to receive conelrad broadcast light be an important consideration continuous low-level light may be provide in the shelter by mean of a 4-cell hot-shot battery to which be wire a 150-milliampere flashlight-type bulb test have show that such a device with a fresh battery will furnish light continuously for at least 10 day with a spare battery a source of light for 2 week or more would be assure a flashlight or electric lantern also should be available for those period when a bright light be need there should be a regular electrical outlet in the shelter a power may continue in many area other consideration if there be outside window in the basement corner where you build a shelter they should be shield a show in the appendix page 29 other basement window should be block when an emergency threaten basement wall that project above the ground should be shield a show in the appendix page 29 in these shelter the entrance should be not more than 2 foot wide bunk or material to build they may have to be put inside the enclosure before the shelter wall be complete the basement or belowground shelter also will serve for tornado or hurricane protection 3 live in a shelter the radioactivity of fallout decay rapidly at first forty-nine hour after an atomic burst the radiation intensity be only about 1 percent of what it be an hour after the explosion but the radiation may be so intense at the start that one percent may be extremely dangerous therefore civil defense instruction receive over conelrad or by other mean should be follow a battery-powered radio be essential radiation instrument suitable for home use be available and would be of value in locate that portion of the home which offer the good protection against fallout radiation there be a possibility that battery-powered radio with built-in radiation meter may become available one instrument thus would serve both purpose you local civil defense will gather it own information and will receive broad information from state and federal source it will tell you a soon a possible how long to stay in you shelter how soon you may go outdoors how long you may stay outside you should be prepare to stay in you shelter full time for at least several day and to make it you home for 14 day or long a checklist in the appendix page 30 tell what be need family with child will have particular problem they should provide for simple recreation there should be a task for everyone and these task should be rotate part of the family should be sleep while the rest be awake to break the monotony it may be necessary to invent task that will keep the family busy record such a diary can be keep the survival of the family will depend largely on information receive by radio a record should be keep of the information and instruction include the time and date of broadcast family ration probably will be necessary blower should be operate periodically on a regular schedule there will come a time in a basement shelter when the radiation have decay enough to allow use of the whole basement however a much time a possible should be spend within the shelter to hold radiation exposure to a minimum the housekeeping problem of live in a shelter will begin a soon a the shelter be occupy food medical supply utensil and equipment if not already store in the shelter must be quickly gather up and carry into it after the family have settle in the shelter the housekeeping rule should be spell out by the adult in charge sanitation in the confine of the family shelter will require much think and plan provision for emergency toilet facility and disposal of human waste will be an unfamiliar problem a cover container such a a kitchen garbage pail might do a a toilet a 10-gallon garbage can with a tightly fit cover could be use to keep the waste until it be safe to leave the shelter water ration will be difficult and should be plan carefully a portable electric heater be advisable for shelter in cold climate it would take the chill from the shelter in the begin even if the electric power fail after an attack any time that the heater have be use will make the shelter that much more comfortable body heat in the close quarter will help keep up the temperature warm clothing and bed of course be essential open-flame heat or cook should be avoid a flame would use up air some family already have hold weekend rehearsal in they home shelter to learn the problem and to determine for themselves what supply they would need 4 if an attack find you without a prepare shelter few area if any be a good a prepare shelter but they be worth know about a family dwelling without a basement provide some natural shield from fallout radiation on the ground floor the radiation would be about half what it be outside the good protection would be on the ground floor in the central part of the house a belowground basement can cut the fallout radiation to one-tenth of the outside level the safe place be the basement corner least expose to window and deep below ground if there be time after the warn the basement shield could be improve substantially by block window with brick dirt book magazine or other heavy material 5 shelter in apartment building large apartment building of masonry or concrete provide good natural shelter than the usual family dwelling in general such apartment afford more protection than small building because they wall be thick and there be more space the central area of the ground floor of a heavily construct apartment build with concrete floor should provide more fallout protection than the ordinary basement of a family dwelling the basement of such an apartment build may provide a much natural protection a the specially construct concrete block shelter recommend for the basement of a family dwelling the federal government be aid local government in several place to survey residential commercial and industrial building to determine what fallout protection they would provide and for how many people the problem for the city apartment dweller be primarily to plan the use of exist space such plan will require the cooperation of other occupant and of the apartment management
