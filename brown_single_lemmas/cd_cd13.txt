if we look about the world today we can see clearly that there be two especially significant factor shape the future of we civilization science and religion science be place in we hand the ultimate power of the universe the power of the atom religion or the lack of it will decide whether we use this power to build a brave new world of peace and abundance for all mankind or whether we misuse this power to leave a world utterly destroy how can we have the wisdom to meet such a new and difficult challenge we may feel pessimistic at the outlook and yet there be a note of hope because this same science that be give we the power of the atom be also give we atomic vision we be look inside the atom and see there a universe which be not material but something beyond the material a universe that in a word be not matter but music and it be in this new vision of the atom that we find an affirmation and an invigoration of we faith atomic energy to see this vision in perspective we need first of all a clear idea of the magnitude of this new power from the atom you know that i could hold right here in i hand the little chunk of uranium metal that be the heart of the bomb that drop on hiroshima it be only about the size of a baseball but pack in that metallic ball there be the explosive force of 20000 ton of afj that be enough tnt to fill the tower of the empire state build and with the availability of bomb of that size war become a new problem now we might have restrict the use of uranium bomb by control the source of uranium because it be find in only a few place in the world but we have hardly start to adjust we think to this new uranium weapon when we be face with the hydrogen bomb hydrogen be just a plentiful a uranium be scarce we know that we have hydrogen in water water be afj and the h stand for hydrogen there be also hydrogen in wood and hydrogen in we body i have calculate that if i could snap i finger in one magic gesture to release the power of all the hydrogen in i body i would explode with the force of a hundred bomb of the kind that fall on hiroshima i will nt try the experiment but i think you can see that if we all know the secret and we could all let ourselves go there would be quite an explosion and then think how little hydrogen we have in we compare with the hydrogen in delaware bay or in the ocean beyond salt water be still afj the same hydrogen be there and the size of the ocean show we the magnitude of the destructive power we hold in we hand today of course there be also an optimistic side to the picture for if i know the secret of let this power in i body change directly into electricity i could rent myself out to the electric company and with just the power in i body i could light all the light and run all the factory in the entire unite state for some day and think if we all know this secret and we could pool we power what a wonderful public utility company we would make with just the hydrogen of we body we could run the world for year then think of delaware bay and the ocean and you see that we have a supply of power for millions of year to come it be power with which we can literally rebuild the world provide adequate house food education abundant live for everyone everywhere an octillion atom now let we see where this power come from to grasp we new view of the atom we have to appreciate first of all how small the atom be i have be try to make this clear to i own class in chemistry one night there be some dry pea lie on we kitchen table and these pea look to i like a little group of atom and i ask myself a question suppose i have the same number of pea a there be atom in i body how large an area would they cover i calculate first that there be about an octillion atom in the average human body that be a figure one with 27 cipher quite a large number then i calculate that a million pea would just about fill a household refrigerator a billion pea would fill a small house from cellar to attic a trillion pea would fill all the house in a town of about ten thousand people and a quadrillion pea would fill all the building in the city of philadelphia i see that i would soon run out of building at this rate so i decide to take another measure the whole state of pennsylvania imagine that there be a blizzard over pennsylvania but instead of snow snow it snow pea so we get the whole state cover with pea about four foot deep you can imagine what it would look like go out on the turnpike with the pea bank up against the house and cover the car pennsylvania thus blanket would contain about a quintillion pea but we still have a long way to go next we imagine we blizzard rage over all the land area of the entire globe north america south america europe asia and africa all cover with pea four foot deep then we have sextillion pea next we freeze over the ocean and cover the whole earth with pea then we go out among the neighboring star collect 250 planet each the size of the earth and also cover each of these with pea four foot deep and then we have septillion finally we go into the far reach of the milky way we get 250000 planet we cover each of these with we blanket of pea and then at last we have octillion pea correspond in number to the atom in the body so you see how small an atom be and how complicate you be a speck and space now although an atom be small we can still in imagination have a look at it let we focus on an atom of calcium from the tip of the bone of i finger and let we suppose that i swallow a magic alice in wonderland grow pill i start grow rapidly and this calcium atom grow along with i i shoot up through the roof into the sky past the cloud through the stratosphere out beyond the moon out among the planet until i be over a hundred and fifty million mile long then this atom of calcium will swell to something like a great balloon a hundred yard across a balloon big enough to put a football field inside and if you should step inside of such a magnify atom accord to the physics of forty year ago you would see circulate over you head down at the side and under you foot some twenty luminous ball about the size of football these ball be move in great circle and ellipses and be of course the electron the particle of negative electricity which by they action create the force that tie this atom of calcium to the neighboring atom of oxygen and make up the solid structure of i finger bone since these electron be move like planet you may wonder whether there be an atomic sun at the center of the atom so you look down there and you see a tiny whirl point about the size of the head of a pin this be the atomic sun the atomic nucleus even if the atom be big enough to hold a football field this nucleus be still only about the size of a pinhead it be this atomic nucleus that contain the positive charge of electricity hold these negatively charge electron in they orbit it also contain nearly all the mass and the atomic energy you may ask what else there be and the answer be nothing nothing but empty space and since you be make of atom you be nothing much but empty space too if i could put you body in an imaginary atomic press and squeeze you down squeeze these hole out of you in the way we squeeze the hole out of a sponge you would get small and small until finally when the last hole be go you would be small than the small speck of dust that you could see on this piece of paper someone have remark that this be certainly the ultimate in reduce at any rate it show we how immaterial we be music of the sphere now this 1920 view of the atom be on the whole a discourage picture for we believe that the electron obey the law of mechanic and electrodynamic and therefore the atom be really just a little machine and in mechanic the whole be no more than the sum of the part so if you be make of atom you be just a big machine and since the universe be also make of atom it be just a supermachine and this would mean that we live in a mechanistic universe govern by the law of cause and effect bind in chain of determinism that hold the universe on a completely predetermine course in which there be not room for soul or spirit or human freedom and this be why so many scientist a half a century ago be agnostic or atheist then come the scientific revolution in the late 1920 s a suggestion from louis de broglie a physicist in france show we that these electron be not point particle but wave and to see the mean of this new picture imagine that you can put on more powerful glass and go back inside the atom and have a look at it in the way we view it today now a you step inside instead of see particle orbit around like planet you see wave and ripple very much like the ripple that you get on the surface of a pond when you drop a stone into it these ripple spread out in symmetrical pattern like the rise window of a great cathedral and a the wave flow back and forth and merge with the wave from the neighboring atom you can put on a magic hear aid and you hear music it be a music like the music from a great organ or a vast orchestra play a symphony harmony melody counterpoint symphonic structure be there and a this music ebb and flow there be an antiphonal chorus from all the atom outside in fact from the atom of the entire universe and so today when we examine the structure of we knowledge of the atom and of the universe we be force to conclude that the good word to describe we universe be music the island of nantucket part of the state of massachusetts lie about thirty-one mile southeast of it mother state some of the island be sand and be not suitable for live the island folk have they live almost entirely from summer visitor the rest be obtain from harbor scallop during about three and a half month of the year in the summer there be three boat that run from the mainland to the island carry passenger food and car but the rest of the year only one boat be need which tie up at the mainland night and make the trip down to nantucket in the daytime this be a fine trip too on a good day with martha s vineyard on one side and the open sea on the other it make an excellent trip of about three hour
