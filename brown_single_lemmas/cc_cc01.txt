it be not news that nathan milstein be a wizard of the violin certainly not in orchestra hall where he have play countless recital and where thursday night he celebrate he 20th season with the chicago symphony orchestra play the brahm concerto with he own slash demon-ridden cadenza melt into the high pale pure and lovely song with which a violinist unlock the heart of the music or forever find it close there be about that song something incandescent for this brahm be milstein at white heat not the nobl performance we have hear he play or the most spacious or even the most eloquent those would be reserve for the orchestra s great night when the soloist can surpass himself this time the orchestra give he some superb support fire by response to he own high mood but he have in walter hendl a will conductor able only up to a point that be when mr milstein thrust straight to the core of the music spark fly bow shred violin sing glitter and sometimes spit mr hendl could go along but mr hendl do not go straight to any point he flounder and let music sprawl there be in the brahm none of the mysterious and marvelous alchemy by which a great conductor can bring soloist orchestra and music to ultimate fusion so we have some dazzle and memorable milstein but not great brahm the concert open with another big romantic score schumann s overture to manfred which suffer fate this time with orchestral thrust to the byronic point to keep it afloat hindemith s joust with weber tune be a considerably more serious misfortune for it demand transluscent texture buoyant rhythm and astringent

next season when san francisco use the dallas don giovanni design by franco zeffirelli h e bate have scribble a farce call hark hark the lark it be one of the most entertain and irresponsible novel of the season if there be a moral lurk among the shenanigans it be hard to find perhaps the lesson we should take from these page be that the welfare state in england still allow wild scope for all kind of rugged eccentric anyway a number of they meet here in devastate collision one be an imperial london stockbroker call jerebohm another be a wily countryman call larkin whose blandly boisterous progress have be chronicle i believe in early volume of mr bate comedie humaine what s up now well jerebohm and he wife pinkie have reach the stage of affluence that stir a long for the more atrociously expensive rustic simplicity they want to own a junior-grade castle or a manor house or some modest little place where shakespeare might once have stage a pageant for great elizabeth and all she bearded courtier they be will to settle however in anything that offer pheasant to shoot at and peasant to work at and of course larkin have just the thing they want splendor by sorcery it s a horror the name of it be gore court and it be surround by a wasteland that would impress ts eliot that s not precisely the way larkin urge they to look at it though he conjure herd of deer and wild bird crowd the air he suggest that gore court embody all the glory of tudor splendor the stained-glass window may have develop unpremeditated patina the paneling may be no more durable than the plank in a political platform the vast dungeon kitchen may seem hardly worth use except on occasion when one be face with a thousand unexpect guest for lunch larkin have an answer to all that the spaciousness of the tudor cook area for example will provide need space for the extra television set require by modern butler cook and maid also perhaps table-tennis and other indoor sport to keep they fit and content it s a wonder really to how much mendacious trouble larkin put himself to sell the jerebohms that preposterous manse he do nt really need the immense sum of money probably convert from american gold on the london exchange he make they pay for larkin be already wonderfully content with he lot he have a glorious wife and many child when he need money to buy something like say the rolls-royce he keep near he vegetable patch he take a flyer in the sale of surplus army supply one of those capital-gains venture in fact have saddle he with gore court he be will to sell it just to get it off he hand and the jerebohms be more than will to buy it they plan to become county people who know the proper way to terminate a fox s life on earth first one then the other if in larkin s eye they be nothing but piccadilly farmer he have a much to learn about they a they have to learn about the way of truly rural live mr bate show we how this mutual education spread it inevitable havoc oneupmanship be practice by both side in a total war first the larkins be ahead then the jerebohms after larkin have be persuade to restock he tangle acre with pheasant he poach only what he need for the nourishment of he family and local caller one of the local caller a retire brigadier apparently leave over from kipling s tale of india do not approve of the way larkin get he bird he do nt think that pot they from a deck chair on the south side of the house with a quart glass of beer for sustenance be entirely sport but the brigadier dine on the bird with relish it be truly odd and ironic that the most handsome and impressive film yet make from miguel de cervantes don quixote be the brilliant russian spectacle do in wide screen and color which open yesterday at the fifty-fifth street and sixty-eighth street playhouse more than a beautiful visualization of the illustrious adventure and escapade of the tragi-comic knight-errant and he squire sancho panza in seventeenth-century spain this inevitably abbreviate render of the classic satire on chivalry be an affectingly warm and human exposition of character nikolai cherkasov the russian actor who have play such heroic role a alexander nevsky and ivan the terrible perform the lanky don quixote and do so with a simple dignity that bridge the inner nobility and the surface absurdity of this poignant man he addle-brained knight-errant self-appointed to the ridiculous position in an age when armor have already be relegate to museum and the chivalrous code of knight-errantry have become a joke be a cervantes no doubt intend a gaunt but gracious symbol of good move soberly and sincerely in a world of cynic hypocrite and rogue cherkasov do not caricature he a some actor have be incline to do he treat this deep-eyed bearded bony crackpot with tangible affection and respect direct by grigory kozintsev in a tempo that be studiously slow he develop a sense of a high tradition shine brightly and pass gravely through an impious world the complexity of communication have be considerably abet in this case by appropriately stilt english language that have be excellently dub in place of the russian dialogue the voice of all the character include that of cherkasov have richness roughness or color to conform with the personality and the subtlety of the dialogue be most helpfully convey since russian be be speak instead of spanish there be no violation of artistry or logic here splendid too be the performance of yuri tolubeyev one of russia s lead comedian a sancho panza the fat grotesque squire though he character be broad and more comically round than the don he give it a firmness and toughness a sort of peasant dignity too it be really a though the russian have see in this character the oftentimes underlie vitality and courage of suppose buffoon the episode in which sancho panza conclude the joke that be play on he when he be facetiously put in command of an island be one of the good in the film true the pattern and flow of the drama have strong literary quality that be a bit wearisome in the first half before don quixote go to the duke s court but strength and poignancy develop thenceforth and the windmill and deathbed episode gather the thread of realization of the wonderfulness of the old boy there be other good representation of peasant and people of the court by actor who be finely costume and magnificently photograph in this last of the russian film to reach this country in the program of joint cultural exchange also on the bill at the fifty-fifth street be a nice ten-minute color film call sunday in greenwich village a tour of the haunt and joint
