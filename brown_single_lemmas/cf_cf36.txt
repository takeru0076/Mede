it be john who find the lion track he find they near the carcass of a zebra that have be kill the night before and he circle once nose to the ground hair shoot up along he back a it do when he be after lion or bear and then he lift he head and bay and the pack join in all head high and jones know it be a hot trail he stifle the comanche yell and let john lead he straight toward the nearby black volcanic mountain this mountain be know a the black reef and it rise almost perpendicularly for about two hundred foot honeycomb with cave top cover with dense scrub and creeper and tall grass on the south it end sharply a though the lava have be cut off there suddenly kearton and ulyate have start the day together while jones follow the dog and mean and loveless have take another route and now with the discovery of the fresh trail still unknown to he ulyate rein in in the shadow of the reef and point kearton focus he field glass that s the colonel he say but i can nt see the dog a they watch jones ride straight for the reef then they pick up the small black speck on the plain in front of he the dog be work a trail lion hyena the pack have make a bend to the north swing back toward the reef and kearton and ulyate could hear they faintly kearton get off and tear up some dry grass that grow in crack between the rock and pile it in a heap and want to make the smoke signal that would bring loveless and mean and the rest of the party not yet caution ulyate jones come toward they fast now along the southern toe of the reef and the dog could be hear plainly old john with he grand canyon voice outstanding above the other there be sound too also a veteran of the north rim and rastus and the rake from a pack of english fox-hounds and a collie from a london pound and simba a terrier a motley pack choose for effectiveness not beauty jones be gallop close behind they lean down cheer they on light it ulyate say and kearton touch a match to the pile of grass blow on it and flame lick out he throw green stuff on it and a thin blue column of smoke rise that will fetch the gang and tell the colonel where we be two quick shot sound then there be a chorus of wild bark and bay then the heavy roar of a lion kearton and ulyate look at each other and begin to gallop toward the sound it come from the top of the reef not half a mile away at the base of the rocky hillside they leave they horse and climb on foot the route be choke with rugged lava-rocks creeper and bush so thickly overgrow that when kearton lose sight of ulyate and call ulyate answer from ten foot away nice country to meet a lion in face to face ulyate and kearton climb on toward the sound of the bark of the dog and the sporadic roar of the lion till they come out of breath to the crest and peer through the branch of a bush this be what ulyate see jones who have apparently and actually have ride up the nearly impassable hillside sit calmly on he horse within forty foot of a full-grown young lioness who be crouch on a flat rock and seem just about to charge he while the dog whirl around she ulyate draw back with a start and put finger to lip almost afraid to move or whisper lest it set she off the dog have get she bay she s just the other side of that bush and when they have draw back a step he add jones be sit on he horse right in front of she why she do nt charge he i do nt know and he have nt even get a knife on he he could nt get away from she in this kind of ground careful do nt disturb she jones have be about a hundred and fifty foot from she when he first break through to the top of the reef she be stand on a flat rock three foot above ground and when she see he she rise to full height and roar open she mouth wide lash she tail and stamp at the rock with both forefeet in irritation a much a to say how dare you disturb i in i sacred precinct intuition tell he however that she be tire and wind from the run up the reef and would not charge yet he move forward to within thirty-five foot of she be careful because he know the female be less predictable than the male in the graveyard at nairobi he have be show the grave of thirty-four big game hunter kill hunt the animal he be attempt to lasso of the thirty-four seventeen have be kill by lion and eleven out of the seventeen by lioness she snarl terribly but intuition tell he again that she be bluff and he could see that half she attention be distract by the dog he throw the lasso it be fall over she head when a branch of a bush catch it and it fall in front of she on the rock even then if she take one step forward he could catch she but john nip she rear end one lion s rear end be a good a another to john africa arizona no matter and she change end and take a swipe at john but he duck back jones then recoil he rope and throw again this time hit she on the back but fail to encircle she she whirl and face he roar terribly and ulyate watch through the leave could not understand why she do not charge and obliterate he because he would nt have much of a chance of get away in that thick growth but she seem just a trace uncertain while jones on the other hand appear perfectly confident and ulyate decide perhaps that be the answer from the lioness point of view this strange creature on the back of another creature lash out with it long thin paw very likely appear a something she could not at first cope with but now she sink low to the rock she roar change to a growl she tail no long lash although she appear more subdue and defeat jones know she be grow more dangerous she be rest and could mount a charge just the tip of she tail be move a she crouch and she be tread lightly up and down with she hind foot at this moment loveless and mean arrive crash through the undergrowth with they horse and distract she and she run off a short distance and jump into a crevice between two rock the dog follow she and she kill three and badly wound old john we ve get to get she out of there jones yell or she ll kill em all bring i the firecracker for such an emergency he have include fourth-of-july cannon cracker a part of they equipment light one he pitch it into the crevice and the lioness leave off maul the dog and depart ai nt she a beauty though call out mean a she run do nt you go a step near she than i do jones warn and if you do go at a run so you ll have momentum for two hour they drive she from one strong point to another along the side of the reef try to maneuver she onto the plain where they could get a good throw but she cling to the rock and brush and the day wear away it be hot the dog be tire the man be tire too it be the story of the rhinoceros fight all over again and the sun be begin to go down if dark come they would lose she i ll get a pole jones say finally and i ll poke a noose over she head at this moment she be crouch in a cave-like aperture halfway down the reef ulyate make no comment but he face show what he think of poke rope over lion head with pole and of course these be the lion of fifty year ago not the gentl one of today and this one be angry with good reason loveless too object it will nt work colonel just the same we ll try it but without wait for they to try it she scatter the dog and shoot down the reef and out across the plain john lead the chase after she and the other dog string out behind many of they trail blood john himself be bruise and claw from head to tail but he be in this fight to the finish run almost a strongly now a in the morning she take refuge on a tongue of land extend into a gully crouch at the base of a thorn tree and wait for they to come up she have choose the spot well with the gully on three side she could be approach only along the tongue of land careful now jones warn mean try she first very slowly he maneuver he rawboned bay gelding edge close watch for a chance to throw but ready to spin and run rope whine about he head horse edge tensely under he but the gelding be obedient and respond and be not paralyze by the close proximity of the lion they tell you horse go crazy at the sight or smell of a bear or a lion but these do nt mean edge close she snarl warningly mean spit and edge on again she snarl and again he edge the pony be sidewise to she with a whirl jump it could get into gear however nothing on four leg be suppose to be fast than a lion over a short distance unless it be a cheetah she charge mean spin and spur for thirty yard she gain rapidly she be close and within one more bind would have be able to reach the rear end of the bay but and here jones and loveless and ulyate be hold breath for all they be worth she never quite catch up that last bind mean hold steady one jump ahead of she then gradually he begin to pull away a western cowpony have outrun an african lion from a stand start photo show late that she d be about six foot from mean of course the factor of head start make all the difference how much head start no one know exactly that be the whole question enough be the answer the lioness quickly change front when she see she could nt catch mean and make for jones a she have do with mean she gain rapidly at first but then baldy begin to draw away somewhere in the few scant yard of head start be the determine point when jones too draw away she return to a thorn bush in the neck of land run into the gully crouch low and wait a before this new position however give the ropers a good chance there be room to make a quick dash past the bush and throw a you go so mean edge around on the north side of she jones move in from the south toss he rope and shout he attract she attention he succeed almost too well because once she rise a if to charge and he half wheel he horse he be within fifty foot but she sink back from behind she mean shoot forward at a run kearton begin shout wait wait the camera s jam but mean keep on he race by within twenty foot of she rope she around the neck but a lioness neck be short and thick and with a quick twist she slip the noose off
