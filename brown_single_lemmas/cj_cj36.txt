doubtless it be inevitable that difference of opinion should arise about the method for apply these policy it be nevertheless almost incredible that four year after yalta there should be a complete split over germany with hot head on both side plan to use the german against they former ally and with nazi-minded german expect to recover they power by fight on one side or the other 5 poland frontier when the yalta conference open the american policy of postponing all discussion of russia s western boundary until the peace conference have break down start in great force late in december from a line stretch from east prussia to budapest the red army have sweep two hundred mile across poland to the od thirty mile from berlin and the upper danube region be be rapidly overrun while the western ally have not yet occupy all of the leave bank of the rhine the long delay in open the second front be now work to russia s advantage the west be now glad to propose the 1919 curzon line which be substantially russia s 1941 border a the boundary between russia and poland when this proposal be make stalin speak with strong emotion than at any other time during the conference he stand up to emphasize he strong feel on the subject the bitter memory of russia s exclusion from the paris peace conference and of the west s effort to stamp out bolshevism at it birth boil up within he you would drive we into shame he declare the white russian and the ukrainian would say that stalin and molotov be far less reliable defender of russia than curzon and clemenceau yet after long and earnest discussion stalin accept the curzon line and even agree voluntarily that there should be digression from that line of five to eight kilometer in favor of poland in some region he do not mind the line itself which churchill declare in the house of commons on february 27 1945 he have always believe to be just and right but he do not want it call by a hate name the west have long since forget the event of 1919 but it be not so easy for the red leader who feel that they have suffer great injustice in that period in the dunn-atherton memorandum of february 4 1942 the state department have expect to be able to hold russia in check by withhold agreement to she 1941 boundary now stalin make it clear that he mean to move poland s western border deep into germany back to the western neisse-oder river line take not only east prussia and all of silesia but pomerania and the tip of brandenburg back to and include stettin from six to nine million additional german would be evict though most would have flee and poland would receive far more from germany than the poor territory include the great pripet marsh which she lose to russia stalin declare that he prefer to continue the war a little long although it cost we blood in order to give poland compensation in the west at the expense of the german by this time churchill be not so cordial toward move poland westward a he have be at teheran where he and eden have both heartily approve the idea after a prolong study of the od line on a map at teheran churchill like the picture he would tell the pole he say that they have be give a fine place to live in more than three hundred mile each way at yalta he think more about the six million german who would have to leave try to find work in germany and roosevelt object to the western neisse river be choose in the south instead of the eastern neisse both of which flow into the od the issue be leave in abeyance presumably for the peace conference however there be no real question of the justice of create a strong poland both industrially and agriculturally and one unplagued by large minority of german or russian the move of millions of the german master-race from the very heart of junkerdom to make room for the polish slav whom they have enslave and openly plan to exterminate be a drastic operation but there be little doubt that it be historically justify government of more importance to the west than poland s boundary be the character of she government at yalta the west still believe that eastern europe could be keep in it orbit in spite of the onrush soviet army though little democracy have ever be practise in this region and much of it be still rule by feudalistic mean it be take for grant that at least the form of western democracy would be establish in this area and western capitalism preserve within it believe devoutly a they do in anglo-saxon institution it be important to both roosevelt and churchill that the pole should have they the issue be acute because the exile polish government in london support in the main by britain be still compete with the new lublin government form behind the red army more time be spend in try to marry these incompatible than over any subject discuss at yalta the result be an agreement that the lublin government should be reorganize on a broad democratic basis with the inclusion of democratic leader from poland itself and from the pole abroad and pledge to hold free and unfetter election a soon a possible on the basis of universal suffrage and secret ballot all democratic and anti-nazi party be to have the right to campaign roosevelt act a moderator of the long debate on this issue it be a matter of principle with churchill since britain have declare war in behalf of poland to stalin it be a matter of life and death he make this completely clear speak with great earnestness he say for the russian people the question of poland be not only a question of honor but also a question of security throughout history poland have be the corridor through which the enemy have pass into russia twice in the last thirty year we enemy the german have pass through this corridor it be in russia s interest that poland should be strong and powerful in a position to shut the door of this corridor by she own force it be necessary that poland should be free independent in power therefore it be not only a question of honor but of life and death for the soviet state in other word the soviet union be determine to create a poland so strong a to be a powerful bulwark against germany and so closely tie to russia that there would never be any question of she serve a a cordon sanitaire against the soviet or pose a an independent balance power in between russia and germany byrne say that invariably thereafter the soviet use the same security argument to justify they course in poland this reason be also a inevitable a anything could be any free election that be to be hold in poland would have to produce a government in which moscow have complete confidence and all pressure from the west for free vote by anti-soviet element in poland would be meet by restriction on vote by these element 6 liberate europe in even great degree the same rule apply to the remainder of eastern europe where the upper class have generally collaborate with the nazi even to the extent of send millions of they peasant into russia a a part of hitler s army but at yalta the conflict expectation of east and west be merge into an agreement by the big three to assist all liberate country in europe to create democratic institution of they own choice in any case here in they judgment condition require italic add they would form interim governmental authority broadly representative of all democratic element in the population and pledge to the early possible establishment through free election of government responsive to the will of the people other similar affirmation in the declaration on liberate europe seem to assure democratic institution on the western model late it develop that the soviet have a very different interpretation of democracy which will be discuss late and they judgment never tell they that the big three should unite in establish democratic condition a we understand they within they zone of influence professor mcneill think that at yalta stalin do not fully realize the dilemma which face he that he think the exclusion of the anti-soviet voter from east european election would not be greatly resent by he ally while neither roosevelt nor churchill frankly face the fact that in poland at least genuinely free democratic election would return government unfriendly to russia by any definition of international friendliness also war-time propaganda and cooperation have obscure the difference between russian and western idea of democracy and it seem good to have they cover by verbal formula than to imperil the military victory over germany and japan the application of these formula could not please both side for they really attempt to marry the impossible to the inevitable while oblige to concede government in east europe ally with the soviet union instead of oppose to it we think we have preserve we social and economic system in east europe this illusion be describe in a far-sighted editorial in the new york herald tribune on march 5 1947 in connection with the submission of the satellite peace treaty to the senate in do so marshall and byrne be ask for the ratification of a grim lesson in the fact of international life we have entertain exaggerate idea about we victory automatically establish we system throughout the world we be trouble about the fate of the baltic state yalta leave we with comfort illusion of a western capitalist-democratic political economy reign supreme up to the curzon line and the border of bessarabia italic add this be a penetrate description of we post-war illusion which apply to other area than east europe the same editorial continue that we expect to democratize japan and korea and to see a new china pattern itself easily on we institution we expect in short that most of the world would make itself over in we image and that it would be relatively simple from such a position to deal with the localize aberration of the soviet union yet actually the image correspond in no way to the actuality of the post-war world neither we military we economic nor we ideological power reach far enough to determine the fate of east europe then the editorial add prophetically how far they may reach in asia be yet undetermined but they fall far short of we dream of the war conference here be the good short explanation of the origin of the cold war that have be write fail to heed the lesson so clearly contain in the satellite treaty president truman re-declared the cold war on march 12 1947 in the truman doctrine exactly one week after the herald tribune editorial be write and a year after the cold war have be announce by churchill at fulton missouri in truman s presence then china promptly go communist and mr truman have to fight the interminable korean war for the democratization of korea before we learn how far we writ do reach in asia year of war strain and hatred of heavy arm expenditure and constant danger of another world war have to ensue before the unite state could bring itself to accept the two chief result of world war 2 communist control of east europe and china a new balance of power while the cold war rage it be easy to blame it all on yalta yet in summarize a series of careful essay on the yalta conference for pogue could find no basis for yalta become a symbol for betrayal and a shibboleth for the opponent of roosevelt and international cooperation when the yalta paper be finally publish with great fanfare they have reveal no betrayal by anyone
