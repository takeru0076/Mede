it be a good eight year now since each of we acquire a swim pool eight enlighten vigorous rigorous not wholly unrewarding year we have learn a lot a dash of hydrochemistry here a bit about plumbing and pump-priming there we have have sound ground in the principle of the mailed-fist-in-velvet-glove school of diplomacy we have become amateur insurance expert and fine-feathered yard bird true we problem have lessen a bit a more and more of we neighbor have build they own pool thereby dilute we spectacular attraction but problem cling to pool a any pool owner know so we innate generosity of spirit prompt we to share we trial error and solution with any who be take the pool plunge for the first time in the pious hope that some may profit from we experience where to put it position may not be everything but in the case of a pool it can certainly contribute difficulty social and physical we speak from vary viewpoint one of we have a pool set in a wooded area very near the house the other have he pool far away from the house in a field high on a hill if you be dream of a blue shimmer pool right outside you live room window close you eye firmly and fill in the picture with lot and lot of child damp towel squash tube of suntan oil and semi-inflated plastic toy you be likely to be near the truth you can also see that the great the proximity of the pool to you main live quarter the great the chance for violation of family privacy annoy noise and the lets-make-your-house-our-club attitude on the other hand out-of-sight do not lead to out-of-mind when child can not be easily observe and you have to make a long trek to reach the pool another dilemma a picturesque a a sylvan pond in the forest may be tree offer a leaf and root hazard to the well-being of a pool yet a grassy approach can turn a pool into a float lawn every time the grass be mow a in choose a wife it be only sensible to consider also how appeal a pool be likely to be in bad weather a well a in good in the cold clime for instance you will have to live through the many unglamorous winter month when you pool will hardly look it good it may be a big hole in the ground fill with salt hay or an ice floe stud with log even a neat plastic-covered plunge be not exactly a joy to behold we do however recommend those patent cover to prevent both people and junk flora and fauna generally from accidentally winter in the pool probably no location for a pool be perfect on all count naturally it will be dictate to a large extent by the shape and size of you land but if space and money be no problem and small child be not on hand every day it be certainly more restful to have you pool and entertainment area remove from the immediate environs of the house and a good several foot around the pool should be neither greensward nor wood but good hard pavement the placement of you pool however will not of itself solve the two major problem of pool own those that involve you social life and those pertain to safety cope with they demand stern discipline of yourself a well a of you family neighbor friend and anyone you ever talk to on a transoceanic jet eight year ago while we be go through the mud-sweat-and-tears construction period we be each solace by the vision of early morning dip and even home-comings to a cool family collect around the pool with a buffet table lay out nearby for the lord and master s delectation but not even we first pool-side gathering come anywhere near those rosy fantasy we seem to be witness the population explosion right in we own backyard we respective family look a if they have quadruple have we take a lien on a state park not at all we have merely be discover by the pool shark we be in business from proud pool-owner to perpetual host and handyman be a short step no more than the change from city clothe to trunk naive of we maybe but the result of we impulsive invitation to come over next summer and swim in we new pool be both unexpect and unsettle we book of etiquette after the first few week it be obvious that rule have to be make lay down and obey even if we popularity rating become subnormal a a result so rule we make in unabashed collusion since we viewpoint in this respect coincide precisely we present the fruit of we effort herewith a a single social code for pool owner first and foremost no one no not anyone in the family be allow to issue blanket invitation to he or she own circle just short of forty lash we finally manage to coerce we child to this view they friend and ours be welcome to share the pool but on we term and at we time no friend be to arrive without an invitation or without at least telephone beforehand no ringer either even if they be trail legitimate invitee we want to know when the potlatches telephone exactly how many they be plan to bring so that we will nt end up with a splash mob that look like coney island in august no young child may come without adult except for a specific organize chaperon party and accompany adult be urge to keep an alert and sensible eye on they responsibility a gaggle of gabble mother back to the pool be no safeguard no bottle pool be tolerate bottle pool be we lingo for those who come to swim and sink into we bar while protest that they can only dunk and run sanity solvency and relation with we wine merchant take a beat that first summer a we inadvertently become the neighborhood free-drink stop we designate one day a week a the time when neighborhood teen-agers might swim at definite hour this have save we from constant request seven day a week and make we feel less brutal to the young less fortunate than ours we also work out logistics for sunday afternoon swimmer who arrive two hour early with they weekend guest while we be still enjoy an alfresco lunch en famille we gently usher they to an island of table and chair strategically place on the far side of the pool where they can amuse each other until we get ready to merge side all dress undress to be more exact must be do in we small bath house or at the swimmer home to avoid any possible excuse for a drip parade through you house it be a good idea to have a telephone extension near the pool a well a a direct outdoor route between the pool and the park area we do however provide a limit number of extra suit mainly for child and we stock extra towel and a few inexpensive bathing convenience life-preservers the buckle-on kapok-filled kind be hold in readiness too for the very young preserve life and limb safety rule of course be more important than all the other put together in many locality now the law require all pool to be fence usually to a minimum height of 5 foot but fence or unfenced no pool-side be the place for run or horseplay we allow no underwater endurance contest either or inexpert version of water polo dive board must have non-skid surface coco mat take an awful beat from chlorine and rot quickly but grit-impregnated paint be excellent and diver must be enjoin to look before they leap either on top of someone else or onto a pool edge we pool also have wide shallow step for the benefit of the littl swimmer who can thus be introduce to the water with far great safety than a ladder afford all bottle must be keep a safe distance away from the pool and drink glass be ban in favor of plastic or metal cup when you first acquire a pool we earnestly recommend for you own mental health a good long chat with you insurance agent you should be prepare to cope with any pitfall such a plunge into empty pool or shallow end and all manner of winter a well a summer lawsuit soignee pool alas do not just happen they be the result of a constant and careful contest with the element unless you want to make you wife a pool widow and to spend a great many of you leisure hour nurse you pool s pristine purity it care and feed from ph content to filter and vacuume be good leave to a weekly or bi-monthly professional service of course if you pool be close to the house you wife can always add it to she housekeeping chore you hope or you can make pool care the price of swim for teen-agers even so every pool owner in case of emergency should have some idea of what make thing work a brief course in hydraulics from the pool builder may well be appreciate in a future crisis preserve the pool a sudden high rise in temperature will turn you pool poison green overnight you need more chlorine the wall feel slippery you need algaecide with or without professional help you will have to be able to do some of these job yourself unless you have a full-time pool nurse you should see to it that the trap the dirt-catcher in front of the filter be always clean a pool be no place for a shut trap you should firmly insist that no bobby pin or hair pin be wear in the water when shed they leave rust mark you can hope against hope that come spring clean you fair-weather friend will lend a hand at scrub and furbishing it have happen many hour of spring clean will be save however if you remove the main drain grate when you close the pool season in the fall a the pool be empty stand by to brush down the wall and bottom while they be still wet much of the dirt and leaf stain be easily remove when damp but require dynamite if allow to dry if you have a 6 - to 8-inch drain pipe you may easily wash out all the debris when the grate be out of course when you 6-inch torrent of water be release it may cause a lot of comment a it pass through or by neighboring property do not forget this possibility if you pool be locate on or near slope ground it may have natural drainage which be certainly more desirable than to be face with the annual expense and labor of first pump out the water and then scoop out all the debris it may be true that pool light dramatize an even scene but light also attract all the insect life for mile around once on the water these little visitor seldom leave and this add to you filter and vacuume problem a well a provide a slap good time for all those present often one floodlight high in a tree will provide all the light you need at much less expense we experience have teach we that it pay to buy the good equipment possible from pipe to brush follow pool-care instruction to the letter and be sure that one person in the family or not be regularly responsible for each aspect of the job with no chance for claim it be nt i turn never let anyone not in the know take a turn at the valve even if the little boy do want to play space ship you may find yourself hit bottom literally a you discover that water be run out even while you be put it in
