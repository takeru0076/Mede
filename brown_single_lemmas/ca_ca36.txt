sen john l mcclellan of arkansas and rep david martin of nebraska be again beat the drum to place the union under the anti-monopoly law once more the fallacious equation be advance to argue that since business be restrict under the anti-monopoly law there must be a correspond restriction against labor union the law must treat everybody equally or in the word of anatole france the law in it majestic equality must forbid the rich a well a the poor from beg in the street and sleep under bridge the public atmosphere that have be generate which make acceptance of this law a possibility stem from the disrepute into which the labor movement have fall a a result of mr mcclellan s hearing into corruption in labor-management relation and late into the jurisdictional squabble that plague industrial relation at the missile site the senator be shock by stoppage over allegedly trivial dispute that delay we missile program in addition disclosure that missile worker be earn sum far in excess of what be pay for equivalent work elsewhere provoke he indignation on behalf of the american taxpayer who be foot the bill it be now disclose that the taxpayer not only pay for high wage but he pay the employer strike expense when the latter undertake to fight a strike business week aug 9 1961 report that the unite aircraft company against which the international association of machinist have undertake a strike decide to keep it plant operate the company incur some $ 10 million of expense attributable to four factor advertise to attract new employee hire and train they extra overtime and defective work perform by the new worker the company have bill the unite state government for $ 7500000 of these expense under the defense department regulation allow cost of a type generally recognize a ordinary and necessary for the conduct of the contractor s business rep frank kowalski of connecticut have bring this problem to the attention of the arm service committee the committee remain unresponsive neither have congressman martin nor senator mcclellan be hear from on the matter they be preoccupy with end labor abuse by extend the anti-monopoly law to the union the recent publicity attend the successful federal prosecution of a conspiracy indictment against a number of electrical manufacturer have evoke a new respect for the anti-trust law that be justify neither by they rationale nor by the result they have obtain the anti-trust law inform a business that it must compete but along completely undefined line it must play a game in which there never be a winner the fact be that any business that want to operate successfully can not follow the law hypocrisy thus become the answer to a foolish public policy let we look at the heavy-electrical-goods industry in which general electric westinghouse and a number of other manufacturer be recently convict of engage in a conspiracy to rig price and allocate the market the industry be so structure that price-setting by a multi-product company will vary with the way overhead charge be allocate whether marginal or average price be apply the problem become even more complex where an enterprise be engage in the manufacture of a wide variety of other goods in addition to the heavy electrical equipment account procedure can be vary to provide a rationale for almost any price naturally enterprise of the size of general electric be in a position to structure they price in such a way that the relatively small competitor can be force to the wall in a very short time should these giant really flex they competitive muscle they would become the only survivor in the industry uncle sam would then accuse they of create a monopoly by unfair competition but if they show self-restraint they do nt get the order under the circumstance the only protection for the relatively small manufacturer be to engage in exactly the kind of conspiracy with the giant for which the latter be convict engage in such a conspiracy be an act of mercy by the giant the paradox implicit in the whole affair be show by the demand of the government after the conviction that general electric sign a wide-open consent decree that it would not reduce price so low a to compete seriously with it fellow in other word the anti-trust law design to reduce price to the consumer on monday wednesday and friday become a tool to protect the marginal manufacturer on tuesday thursday and saturday and which theory would govern the enforcer of the law on sunday the question might be ask do nt the management of the heavy-electrical-goods manufacturer know these fact why do they engage in a flood of mea culpas throw a few scapegoat to the dog and promise to be good boy thereafter express they complete confidence in the law the past usefulness of the anti-trust law to management be explain by thurman arnold in the folklore of capitalism back in 1937 he write p 211 the anti-trust law be the answer of a society which unconsciously feel the need of great organization and at the same time have to deny they a place in the moral and logical ideology of the social structure p 214 anti-trust law become the great protection to uncontrolled business dictatorship p 215 when corporate abuse be attack it be do on the theory that criminal penalty would be invoke rather than control in this manner every scheme for direct control break to piece on the great protective rock of the anti-trust law p 228-229 in any event it be obvious that the anti-trust law do not prevent the formation of some of the great financial empire the world have ever know hold together by some of the most fantastic idea all base on the fundamental notion that a corporation be an individual who can trade and exchange goods without control by the government this escape from control have lead to management s evaluate the risk of occasional irrational prosecution a worth while a plea of nolo contendere follow by a nominal fine after all be a small price to pay for this untrammeled license the penalty hand out in the electrical case which include jail sentence be unprecedented in anti-trust prosecution perhaps because the conspirator have display unusual ineptness in they price activity if a substitute mechanism be need for the control of a fictitious impersonal market quite obviously some method must be devise for represent the public interest a secret conspiracy of manufacturer be hardly such a vehicle however one can argue that no such control be necessary a long a one pretend that the anti-trust law be effective and rational quite clearly the anti-trust law be neither effective nor rational and yet the argument go that they should be extend to the labor union those who favor place trade union under anti-trust law imply that they be advocate a brand new reform before 1933 individual who oppose trade union and collective bargain say so in plain english the acceptance of collective bargain a a national policy in 1934 implicit in the write of section 7a of the national industrial recovery act have make it impolitic to oppose collective bargain in principle the wagner act the taft-hartley act and the landrum-griffin act all endorse the principle of collective bargain the basic purpose of an effective collective-bargaining system be the removal of wage from competition if a union can not perform this function then collective bargain be be palm off by organizer a a gigantic fraud the torture reason that union use to deny they ambition to exercise monopoly power over the supply and price of labor be one of the thing that create a legal profession the problem must be face squarely if laborer be merely commodity compete against each other in a market place like so many bag of wheat and corn unsupported by the way by any agricultural subsidy then they may be pardon for react with complete antagonism to a system that impose such status upon they human labor be exactly that a commodity in eighteenth - and nineteenth-century america a early a 1776 adam smith write in the wealth of nation we have no act of parliament against combine to low the price of work but many against combine to raise it eighteenth-century england upon whose custom we common law be build have outlaw union a monopoly and conspiracy in 1825 the boston house carpenter strike for a ten-hour day be denounce by the organize employer who declare it be consider that all combination by any class of citizen intend to effect the value of labor tend to convert all it branch into monopoly there be no pious hypocrisy then about be for collective bargain but against labor monopoly the court share the opinion of the employer in people vs fisher justice savage of the new york supreme court declare without any officious and improper interference on the subject the price of labor or the wage of mechanic will be regulate by the demand for the manufacture article and the value of that which be pay for it but the right do not exist to raise the wage of the mechanic by any force and artificial mean compare this statement of a nineteenth-century judge with how congressman martin accord to the daily labor report of sept 19 1961 defend the necessity of enact anti-trust legislation in the field of labor if we wish to prevent monopolistic fix of wage production or price and if we wish to preserve the freedom of the employer and he employee to contract on wage hour and condition of employment senator mcclellan be propose the application of anti-trust measure to union in transportation he bill allegedly aim at hoffa would amend the sherman clayton and norris-laguardia act to authorize the issuance of federal injunction in any transportation strike and would make it illegal for any union to act in concert with any other union even a sister local in the same international paradoxically the same week in which senator mcclellan be attempt to extend the anti-trust act to labor in transportation the civil aeronautics board be assure the airline that if they meet in concert to eliminate many costly feature of air travel the action would not be deem a violation of the anti-trust act indeed it be in the field of transportation that congress have most frequently grant employer exemption from the anti-trust law for example the organization of steamship conference to set freight rate and the encouragement of railroad to seek merger at the very moment that every attempt be be make to take management out from under the irrationality of anti-trust legislation a drive be on to abolish collective bargain under the guise of extend the anti-monopoly law to union who want no more than to continue to set wage in the same way that ship operator set freight rate the passage of the sherman act be aim at giant monopoly it be most effective against trade union in the famous danbury hatter case a suit be bring against the union by the loewe company for monopolistic practice eg try to persuade consumer not to purchase the product of the strike manufacturer the suit against the union be successful and many worker lose they home to pay off the judgment in 1914 the clayton act attempt to take labor out from under the anti-trust legislation by state that human labor be not to be consider a commodity the law could not suspend economics labor remain a commodity but presumably a privilege one grant immunization from the anti-trust law the court by interpretation emasculate the act in 1922 the unite i worker strike the coronado coal company the company sue under the anti-trust law allege that the union s activity interfere with the movement of interstate commerce what other purpose could a strike union have but to interrupt the flow of commerce from the strike enterprise the court first rule that the strike constitute only an indirect interference with commerce
