foreign policy in it total context with this enlarge role in mind i should like to make a few suggestion what we in the unite state do or do not do will make a very large difference in what happen in the rest of the world we in this department must think about foreign policy in it total context we can not regard foreign policy a something leave over after defense policy or trade policy or fiscal policy have be extract foreign policy be the total involvement of the american people with people and government abroad that mean that if we be to achieve a new standard of leadership we must think in term of the total context of we situation it be the concern of the department of state that the american people be safe and secure defense be not a monopoly concern of the department of defense it be also the concern of the department of state that we trade relationship with the rest of the world be vigorous profitable and active this be not just a pass interest or a matter of concern only to the department of commerce we can no long rely on interdepartmental machinery somewhere upstairs to resolve difference between this and other department assistant secretary of state will now carry an increase burden of active formulation and coordination of policy mean must be find to enable we to keep in touch a regularly and a efficiently a possible with we colleague in other department concern with foreign policy i think we need to concern ourselves also with the timeliness of action every policy officer can not help but be a plan officer unless we keep we eye on the horizon ahead we shall fail to bring ourselves on target with the present the movement of event be so fast the pace so severe that an attempt to peer into the future be essential if we be to think accurately about the present if there be anything which we can do in the executive branch of the government to speed up the process by which we come to decision on matter on which we must act promptly that in itself would be a major contribution to the conduct of we affair action take today be often far more valuable than action take several month late in response to a situation then out of control there will of course be time for delay and inaction what i be suggest be that when we delay or when we fail to act we do so intentionally and not through inadvertence or through bureaucratic or procedural difficulty i also hope that we can do something about reduce the infant mortality rate of idea an affliction of all bureaucracy we want to stimulate idea from the bottom to the top of the department we want to make sure that we junior colleague realize that idea be welcome that initiative go right down to the bottom and go all the way to the top i hope no one expect that only presidential appointee be look upon a source of idea the responsibility for take the initiative in generate idea be that of every officer in the department who have a policy function regardless of rank far i would hope that we could pay attention to little thing while observe the operation of we government in various part of the world i have feel that in many situation where we policy be good we have tend to ignore minor problem which spoil we main effort to cite only a few example the wrong man in the wrong position perhaps even in a junior position abroad can be a source of great harm to we policy the attitude of a un delegate who experience difficulty in find adequate house in new york city or of a foreign diplomat in similar circumstance in we capital can easily be direct against the unite state and all that it stand for dozens of seemingly small matter go wrong all over the world sometimes those who know about they be too far down the line to be able to do anything about they i would hope that we could create the recognition in the department and overseas that those who come across little thing go wrong have the responsibility for bring these to the attention of those who can do something about they if the department of state be to take primary responsibility for foreign policy in washington it follow that the ambassador be expect to take charge overseas this do not mean in a purely bureaucratic sense but in an active operational interest responsible fashion he be expect to know about what be go on among the representative of other agency who be station in he country he be expect to supervise to encourage to direct to assist in any way he can if any official operation abroad begin to go wrong we shall look to the ambassador to find out why and to get suggestion for remedial action the problem of a policy officer it occur to i that you might be interest in some thought which i express privately in recent year in the hope of clear up a certain confusion in the public mind about what foreign policy be all about and what it mean and of develop a certain compassion for those who be carry such responsibility inside government i try to do so by call to they attention some of the problem that a senior departmental policy officer face this mean practically everybody in this room whether it will strike home for you or not will be for you to determine the senior policy officer may be move to think hard about a problem by any of an infinite variety of stimulus an idea in he own head the suggestion of a colleague a question from the secretary or the president a proposal by another department a communication from a foreign government or an american ambassador abroad the file of an item for the agenda of the unite nation or of any other of dozens of international body a news item read at the breakfast table a question to the president or the secretary at a news conference a speech by a senator or congressman an article in a periodical a resolution from a national organization a request for assistance from some private american interest abroad et cetera ad infinitum the policy officer life with he antennae alert for the question which fall within he range of responsibility he first think be about the question itself be there a question here for american foreign policy and if so what be it for he know that the first and sometimes most difficult job be to know what the question be that when it be accurately identify it sometimes answer itself and that the way in which it be pose frequently shape the answer chew it over with he colleague and in he own mind he reach a tentative identification of the question tentative because it may change a he explore it far and because if no tolerable answer can be find it may have to be change into one which can be answer meanwhile he have be think about the fact surround the problem fact which he know can never be complete and the general background much of which have already be lose to history he be appreciative of the expert help available to he and draw these resource into play take care to examine at least some of the raw material which underly they frequently policy-oriented conclusion he know that he must give the expert he place but he know that he must also keep he in it he be already begin to box the compass of alternative line of action include do nothing he know that he be think about action in relation to a future which can be perceive but dimly through a merciful fog but he take he bearing from the great guideline of policy well-established precedent the commitment of the unite state under international charter and treaty basic statute and well-understood notion of the american people about how we be to conduct ourselves in policy literature such a country paper and national security council paper accumulate in the department he will not be surprise to find that general principle produce conflict result in the factual situation with which he be confront he must think about which of these principle must take precedence he will know that general policy paper write month before may not fit he problem because of crucial change in circumstance he be aware that every moderately important problem merge imperceptibly into every other problem he must deal with the question of how to manage a part when it can not be handle without relation to the whole when the whole be too large to grasp he must think of other who have a stake in the question and in it answer who should be consult among he colleague in the department or other department and agency of the government which american ambassador could provide helpful advice be private interest sufficiently involve to be consult what be the probable attitude of other government include those less directly involve how and at what stage and in what sequence be other government to be consult if action be indicate what kind of action be relevant to the problem the selection of the wrong tool can mean waste at good and at bad an unwanted inflammation of the problem itself can the president or the secretary act under exist authority or will new legislation and new money be require should the action be unilateral or multilateral be the matter one for the unite nation or some other international body for if so the path lead through a complex process of parliamentary diplomacy which add still another dimension to the problem respect for the opinion of mankind what type of action can hope to win public support first in this country and then abroad for the policy officer will know that action can almost never be secret and that in general the effectiveness of policy will be condition by the readiness of the country to sustain it he be interest in public opinion for two reason first because it be important in itself and second because he know that the american public care about a decent respect for the opinion of mankind and give probable public attitude about which reasonably good estimate can be make what action be call for to insure necessary support may i add a caution on this particular point we do not want policy officer below the level of presidential appointee to concern themselves too much with problem of domestic politics in recommend foreign policy action in the first place we business be foreign policy and it be the business of the presidential leadership and he appointee in the department to consider the domestic political aspect of a problem mr truman emphasize this point by say you fellow in the department of state do nt know much about domestic politics this be an important consideration if we sit here read editorial and look at public-opinion poll and other report that cross we desk we should realize that this be raw undigested opinion express in the absence of leadership what the american people will do turn in large degree on they leadership we can not test public opinion until the president and the leader of the country have go to the public to explain what be require and have ask they for support for the necessary action i doubt for example that 3 month before the leadership begin to talk about what come to be the marshall plan any public-opinion expert would have say that the country would have accept such proposal the problem in the policy officer s mind thus begin to take shape a a galaxy of utterly complicate factor political military economic financial legal legislative procedural administrative to be sort out and handle within a political system which move by consent in relation to an external environment which can not be under control and the policy officer have the hound of time snap at he heel
