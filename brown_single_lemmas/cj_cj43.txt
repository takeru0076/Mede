mr justice black be one of the minority that rest on the article 1 power in this view support by only three member of the court a power deny by the specific provision of article 3 be grant by the generality of article 1 if this seem arbitrary it effect be to treat citizen of the district of columbia equally with citizen of the state at the expense of expand a troublesome jurisdiction federal question jurisdiction for almost a hundred year we rely upon state court subject to review by the supreme court for the protection of most right arise under national law then in 1875 apparently in response to the nationalize influence of the civil war congress first give the low federal court general authority concurrently with state tribunal to decide case involve federal-right question one purpose of the change be to attain sympathetic enforcement of right insure by the civil war amendment against state interference serious difficulty arise with the advent of substantive due process an amendment presumably design to deal with the problem of newly free slave become a laissez-faire limitation upon state economic policy a flood of federal low court injunction seriously impede the process of local government congress react with a series of measure modify in various way what it have grant in 1875 in 1910 it require the conven of a special three-judge court for the issuance of certain injunction and allow direct appeal to the supreme court such legislation be clarify and extend from time to time thereafter in 1913 an abortive provision be make for the stay of federal injunction proceeding upon institution of state court test case the essential ineffectiveness of these measure result in 1934 in substantial elimination of federal jurisdiction to enjoin state public utility rate order three year late similar restraint be impose upon injunction against collection of state tax this save for state adjudication in the first instance the two major area where federal injunction have be most obnoxious but other area remain vulnerable meanwhile the supreme court like congress show misgiving concern this aspect of government by injunction draw upon the traditional discretion of the chancellor mr justice holmes introduce a series of self-imposed judicial restraint that culminate in mr justice frankfurter s famous doctrine of abstention whereas the early case turn rather narrowly upon the availability of adequate state remedy the new emphasis be upon the nature of the state policy at issue the classic case be railroad commission v pullman the commission have issue an administrative order which be challenge a discriminatory against negroes it enforcement be enjoin by a federal trial court on review the supreme court via mr justice frankfurter find southern racial problem a sensitive area of social policy on which the federal court ought not to enter unless no alternative to adjudication be open an alternative be find in the vagueness of state law a to whether the offend order have in fact be authorize reluctant a usual to interpret state legislation such interpretation can only be a forecast rather than a determination mr justice frankfurter lead a unanimous court to vacate the injunction but it be crucial that here unlike burford the trial court be order to retain the case until the state court have have a reasonable opportunity to settle the state-law question the resource of equity be equal to an adjustment that will avoid the waste of a tentative decision a well a the friction of a premature constitutional adjudication temporary abstention ie postponement be one thing refusal to adjudicate be another to the extent that the jurisdictional principle of 1875 stand unmodified by subsequent legislation federal equitable relief against state action must be available or so it seem to mr justice frankfurter in alabama public service commission v southern ry co the commission have refuse to permit abandonment of certain uneconomic train facility the railroad claim deprivation of property without due process of law seek injunctive relief the court hold that federal jurisdiction should not be exercise lest the domestic policy of the state be obstruct this in the name of equitable discretion justice frankfurter and jackson concur in the court s result for they find no merit in the railroad s claim but they object vigorously to the proposition that federal court may refuse to exercise jurisdiction confer in a valid act of congress by one fall swoop the court now find that congress indulge in needless legislation in the act of 1910 1913 1925 1934 and 1937 by these measure congress so the court in effect now decide give not only needless but inadequate relief since it now appear that the federal court have inherent power to sterilize the act of 1875 against all proceeding challenge local regulation a most reveal recent case be textile worker union v lincoln mill the taft-hartley act give the federal court jurisdiction over suit for violation of contract between an employer and a labor organization represent employee in an industry affect commerce on it face this merely provide a federal forum it do not establish any law right for the federal judge to enforce how can judge exercise jurisdiction to enforce national right when congress have create none the court hold that congress have intend the federal judiciary to fashion an appropriate law of labor-management contract in short congressional power to grant federal-question authority to federal court be now apparently so broad that congress need not create or specify the right to be enforce the lincoln mill decision authorize a whole new body of federal common law which a mr justice frankfurter point out in dissent lead to one of the follow incongruity 1 conflict in federal and state court interpretation of collective bargain agreement 2 displacement of state law by federal law in state court in all action regard collective bargain agreement or 3 exclusion of state court jurisdiction over these matter the justice s elaborate examination of the legislative history of the provision in question suggest that congress purpose be merely to make union suable with a few exception the lawmaker seem unaware of the technical problem of federal jurisdiction involve to say nothing of the delegation of lawmaking power to judge to avoid these constitutional difficulty mr justice frankfurter be prepare to read the taft-hartley provision a concern with diversity rather than federal question jurisdiction this would satisfy what presumably be congress major purpose the suability of union it would also leave intact the state traditional authority in the realm of contract law a we have see the erie and york decision require federal court in diversity case to follow state decisional rule here again mr justice frankfurter could not lightly accept the principle of wholesale judicial legislation if congress want to displace the state from area which they have customarily occupy let it do so knowingly and explicitly and let it do it own lawmaking and not leave that to federal judge do lincoln mill suggest that if congress grant jurisdiction over interstate divorce case the federal court would be authorize to fashion a national law for the dissolution of marriage there be a common problem behind most of these federal question and diversity case congress have not clearly define the bound between state and federal court competence it have the power to do so but for the most part have leave the matter for solution by judge on a case-by-case basis a careful student have suggest that in any new revision of the judicial code the legislator would do well to remember that the allocation of power to the federal court should be limit to those matter in which they expertise in federal law might be use leave to the state judiciary the primary obligation of pronounce state law obviously the goal here propose be the guide principle in mr justice frankfurter s opinion to the extent that congress leave the problem to judicial discretion the same rule of specialization and division of labor guide he in the fela certiorari case in the administrative law area and indeed in the whole realm of judicial review mr justice black no doubt concur in principle but be more apt to make exception to achieve a generous and just result he will not be fool by technicality federal review of state decision with few exception congress have not give federal court exclusive authority to enforce right arise under federal law to put it differently state and federal court have concurrent jurisdiction with respect to most claim of federal right to insure uniformity in the mean of national law however state interpretation be subject to supreme court review it may be note parenthetically that to evade desegregation an ex-justice and former southern governor have urge congress to abolish this review authority the result of course would be that federal law inevitably would mean different thing in different state it would also probably mean different thing within the same state depend upon what court state or federal render decision we consider here only a few of many problem involve in this crucial federal-state relationship the first be that enforcement of national law in state litigation raise in reverse the old diversity puzzle of the relation of procedure to substance subject to certain constitutional restraint in favor of fair trial each level of government be free to devise it own judicial procedure litigant who choose to assert federal claim in a state court go into that court subject to it rule of procedure a similar canon apply to those who press state claim in federal tribunal eg in diversity case in an fela controversy the state court follow establish state procedure by construe a vague complaint most strongly against the complainant in other word the burden of plead clearly rest upon the pleader by state law the result be that the plaintiff s case be dismiss mr justice black lead a reverse majority strict local rule of plead can not be use to impose unnecessary burden upon right of recovery authorize by federal law here a in the byrd case another element of state procedure be subsume to federal judge-made law justice frankfurter and jackson dissent one state may cherish formality more than another one state may be more responsive than another to procedural reform if a litigant choose to enforce a federal right in a state court he can not be hear to object if he be treat exactly a be plaintiff who press like claim arise under state law with regard to the form in which the claim must be state the particularity for instance with which a cause of action must be describe federal law though invoke in a state court delimit the federal claim define what give a right to recovery and what go to prove it but the form in which the claim must be state need not be different from what the state exact in the enforcement of like obligation create by it so long a a requirement do not add to or diminish the right a define by federal law nor burden the realization of this right in the actuality of litigation another problem in the area of federal-state relationship be this what constitute reversible error in a state decision terminiello v chicago involve a conviction for disorderly conduct under a local ordinance the conduct in question be a speech the accuse do not object to the trial court s charge to the jury that discourse may constitute a breach of the peace if it stir the public to anger invite dispute bring about a condition of unrest for present purpose it may be assume that this charge so narrowly limit speech a to violate the federal constitution though the accuse raise many other objection he do not object on this crucial point at any stage of the proceeding that be he do not claim in any of the four court through which he case progress that the jury charge have deny he any federal right
