for by now the original cause of the quarrel philip s seizure of gascony be only one strand in the spider web of french interest that overlay all western europe and that have be so well and closely spin that the light movement could set it tremble from one end to the other even so edward s ambassador can scarcely have foresee that five year of unremitting work lie ahead of they before peace be finally make and that when it do come the countless embassy that leave england for rome during that period have very little to do with it it be hard not to lie most of the blame for they failure on the pope nogaret be hardly an impartial witness and even he do not make he charge against boniface until the latter be dead but there be some truth in what he say and more in what he do not say it be not merely a hunger for money gold and precious object that delay the papal pronouncement that could have bring the war to an end the pope be play a dangerous game with so many ball in the air at once that a misstep would bring they all about he ear and he only hope be to temporize so that he could take advantage of every change in the delicate balance of european affair when the negotiation begin he quarrel with the king of france be temporarily in abeyance and he have no intention of revive it so long a there be hope that french money would come to pay the troop who under charles of valois the papal vicar of tuscany be so valuable in the crusade against the colonna cardinal and they sicilian ally if he circumspection in regard to philip s sensibility go so far that he even refuse to grant a dispensation for the marriage of amadee s daughter agnes to the son of the dauphin of vienne a truly peacemaking move accord to thirteenth-century idea for savoy and dauphine be a usual fight on opposite side for fear that he might seem to be favore the anti-french coalition he would certainly never take the far more drastic step of order the return of gascony to edward even though a he admit to the english ambassador he have be advise that the original cession be invalid on the other hand he do not want to offend edward either and he find himself in a very difficult position on the surface the whole question be purely feudal the french be now occupy gascony and flanders on the technical ground that they ruler have forfeit they by a breach of the feudal contract but edward be invade scotland for precisely the same reason and he insubordinate vassal be the ally of the king of france boniface have to uphold the sacredness of the feudal contract at all cost for it be only a suzerain of sicily and of the patrimony of peter that he have any justification for he italian war but in the english-scottish-french triangle it be almost impossible for he to recognize the claim of any one of the contestant without seem to invalidate those of the other two because of these involvement in the matter at stake boniface lack the impartiality that be suppose to be an essential qualification for the position of arbiter and in retrospect that would seem to be sufficient reason why the english embassy to the curia prove so fruitless but when the situation be so complicate that even nogaret one of the principal actor in the drama could misinterpret the pope s motive it be possible that othon and he companion equally baffle attribute they difficulty to a more immediate cause this be boniface s monumental tactlessness tact by it very derivation imply that it possessor keep in touch with other people but the author of clericis laicos and unam sanctam the wielder of the two sword the papal sun of which the imperial moon be but a dim reflection the peer of caesar and vice-regent of christ be so high above other human being that he have forget what they be like he be a learn and brilliant man one of the good jurist in europe and with flash of penetrate insight and yet in he dealing with other people particularly when he try to be ingratiate he be capable of an abysmal stupidity that can have come only from a complete incomprehension of human nature and human motive this lofty disregard for other be not share by such man a pierre flotte and he associate that brilliant group of mediocre man a powicke call they who provide the brain for the french embassy that come to rome under the nominal leadership of the archbishop of narbonne the duke of burgundy and the count of st-pol they have rise from humble beginning by they own diligence and astuteness they be unfetter by the code that bind noble like othon or even the old generation of clerk like hotham and they be work for an end that they opponent have never even visualize boniface be late to explain to the english that robert of burgundy and guy de st-pol be easy enough to do business with it be the clerk who cause the mischief and who make he say that the rule passion of they race be covetousness and that in deal with they he never know whether he have to do with a frenchman or with a devil to the pope head of the universal church to the duke of burgundy take full advantage of he position on the border of france and of the empire or to othon who find it quite natural that he should do homage to edward for tipperary and to the count of savoy for grandson flotte s outspoken nationalism be completely incomprehensible and yet he make no pretense about it when the pope try no doubt to appeal to he good nature say to he you have already take normandy do you want to drive the king of england from all he overseas possession the frenchman s answer be a terse vous dites vrai loyal and unscrupulous with a single-minded ambition to which he devote all he energy he outmatch the english diplomat time and time again until by a kind of poetic justice he fall at the battle of courtrai the victim of the equally nationalistic if less articulate flemings the english rely on a prejudice arbiter and confront with superior diplomatic skill be also hamper in they negotiation by the event that be take place at home the scot have find a new leader in william wallace and edward s yearly expedition across the border call for evermounting tax which only increase he difficulty with the baron and the clergy he be unable to send any more help to he ally on the continent and during the next few year many of they leave to resist french pressure unaided surrender to the inevitable and make they peace with philip the defeat and death of adolf of nassau at the hand of albert of habsburg also work to the disadvantage of the english for all the effort to revive the anti-french coalition come to nothing when philip make an alliance with the new king of the roman these shift in alliance and allegiance not only increase the difficulty confront the english embassy a a whole but also directly involve the two savoyards amadee and othon in spite of the armistice negotiate by amadee two year early the war between bishop guillaume of lausanne and louis of savoy be still go on and although little be know about it that little prove that it be yet another phase of the struggle against french expansion and be closely interwoven with the large conflict a second truce have be arbitrate in april 1298 by jeans darlay lord of chalon-sur-saone the most staunch of edward s burgundian ally and these last be represent in the discussion at the curia by gautier de montfaucon othon s neighbor and a member of the vaudois coalition but although in many of these discussion othon and amadee might have be tempt to consider they own interest a well a those of the king edward s confidence in they be so absolute that they be make the acknowledge leader of the embassy amadee may have owe this partly to he relationship with the king but othon who at sixty seem still to have be a simple knight merit he position solely by he own character and ability the young man vere and pembroke who be also edward s cousin and whose lusignan blood give he the swarthy complexion that cause edward of carnarvon s irreverent friend pier gaveston to nickname he joseph the jew be relatively new to the game of diplomacy but pontissara have be on mission to rome before and hotham a man of great learn jocund in speech agreeable to meet of honest religion and please in the eye of all and an archbishop to boot be a reliable and experience a othon himself but all the report of this first embassy show that the two savoyards be the head of it for they be the only one who be empower to swear for the king that he would abide by the pope s decision and who be allow to appoint deputy in the event that one be unavoidably absent this also give they the unpleasant duty of be spokesman for the mission and they could foresee that that would not be easy underneath all the high-sounding phrase of royal and papal letter and behind the more down-to-earth instruction to the envoy be the inescapable fact that edward would have to desert he flemish ally and leave they to the vengeance of they indignant suzerain the king of france in return for be give an equally free hand with the insubordinate scot this be a doubly bitter blow to the king in the eye of those who still care for such thing it be a reflection on he honor and it give far ground for complaint to he overtax subject who be already grumble although probably not in latin non est lex sana quod regi sit mea lana bad relation between england and flanders bring hard time to the shepherd scatter over the dale and down a well a to the crowd flemish city and while the english so far have do no more than grumble othon have see what the discontent might lead to for before he leave the low country the citizen of ghent have rise in protest against the expense of support edward and he troop and the regular soldier have find it unexpectedly difficult to put down the nasty little riot that ensue in all the talk of feudal right the knight and bishop must never forget the woolworkers nor be it easy to do so for all along the road to italy they pass the florentine pack train go home with they load of raw wool from england and rough flemish cloth the former to be spin and weave by the arte della lana and the latter to be refine and dye by the arte della calimala with the pigment recently discover in asia minor by one of they member bernardo rucellai the secret of which they jealously keep for themselves these chatty merchant make amuse and instructive travel companion for they business take they to all four corner of the globe and florentine gossip have already reach a high stage of development a even a cursory glance at the inferno will prove a northern ambassador will to keep he mouth shut and he ear open could learn a lot that would stand he in good stead at the curia they have other topic of conversation besides they news from court and fair which be of interest to othon the builder of castle in wale and church in he native country behind he lie the low country where man be still complete the cathedral that a late florentine would describe a a malediction of little tabernacle one on top of the other with so many pyramid and spire and leave that it be a wonder they stand up at all for they look a though they be make of paper instead of stone or marble the low country where the middle age be to last for another two century and die out only when charles the bold of burgundy meet he first
