most recreation work call for a good deal of pre-plan this be particularly true in site selection you must know before you start what the need and objective of you organization be you must have a list of requirement on where how many and what type site be need with such a program you can make constructive selection of the good site available begin the examination of a site with a good map and aerial photo if possible these be become more and more available through the work of county and other government agency the new edition of topographic map be make by the federal government be excellent for orient yourself to the natural feature of the site these be inexpensive and available from the we geological society washington 25 d c in recent year many county and the we forest service have take aerial photo which show feature in detail and be very good for plan use most county also have map available from the county engineer show road and other feature and from the assessor s office show ownership of land inspect the site in the field during the time of the year when the area will be most heavily use for recreation this give you a good opportunity to get the feel of the climate condition the exposure to the sun and wind the water interest etcetera which vary greatly with the season it be usually helpful to make a sketch map in the field show the size and location of the feature of interest and to take photograph at the site these be a great aid for plan use back at the office for site plan work it be good to have a qualify and experience park planner to carry through the study however there be also much to be gain by make use of the ability of the local people who be available and interest in recreation county judge commissioner engineer assessor and other who have live in the area for a long time may have valuable knowledge regard the site or opinion to offer from they vary professional experience a visit to the site by a group of several person can usually bring out new idea or verify opinion most helpful to the plan study of any recreation area how much study be require this of course depend on the character of the site itself the previous experience of the investigator and the number of factor need to arrive at a good decision it be too easy for the inexperience person to make a quick judgment of a few value of the area and base a decision on these alone usually there be more factor to good site plan than first impression a site may be a rundown slum or a desolate piece of desert in appearance today but have excellent potential for the future with a little development or water the same be true of area which at first look good because of a few exist recreation feature but may actually be poor area to develop for general public use in look for the good site available that meet the requirement you need information to compare the site with other you need answer to four important question what be the exist recreation feature how well can the site be develop how useful will it be to the public be this site available check the quantity and quality of all of the recreation interest already exist at the site naturally a park site with scenic view a good lake tree and sand dune will attract more people than a nearby area with only tree and dune quality be vitally important frontage on a body of clear clean water will be vastly different from the same amount of frontage on pollute water some recreation feature such a scenic value and water interest also have great overall value than other interest one of the most desirable feature for a park be beautiful view or scenery it may be distant view of a valley or the mountain or natural feature such a a small lake colorful rock formation or unusual tree a site which overlook a harbor or river may offer interest in the activity of boat traffic an area on the coast may have relax view of the surf roll in on a beach a site may also be attractive just through the beauty of it tree and shrub note extent of these interest and how available they will be for the public to enjoy water interest be one of the most valuable factor you can find for a recreation site most park planner look to water frontage for basic park area this follow naturally since frontage on an ocean stream or lake provide scenic value and opportunity for the very popular recreation activity of bathing fish boat and other water sport a body of water be usually the center of interest at park which attract the great picnic and camp use it also cool the air in summer and nourish the tree and wild life the amount of water frontage the quantity and quality of the water and the recreation afford by it be important a restrict frontage may be too crowd an area for public use the quantity of water flow may be critical a stream or pond which be attractive in the springtime may become stagnant or dry in late summer if the site be on a reservoir the level of the water at various season a it affect recreation should be study check the quality of the water a stream which have all of it watershed within a national forest or other land under good conservation practice be less likely to be affect by pollution than one pass through unrestricted log or past an industrial area other factor such a water temperature depth of water the fish life it support wave action flood etcetera will affect it recreation value other natural feature which can be of high interest be the forest canyon mountain desert seacoast beach sand dune waterfall spring etcetera with which the area be bless just a the national and state park place emphasis on feature which be of national or state significance county should seek out these feature which be distinctive of they area although the site may not contain the feature themselves there be often opportunity to include they a additional interest to the site the route to the park may lead people past they or display view of they a group of native tree or plant which be outstanding in a particular county can be feature at the site the fish animal and bird which may be find at the site be another interest fish interest call for a check of the species find quantity and size the season they be available and the stock program of the fish commission animal may be present at the site or provide hunt in nearby area the site may be on one of the major flyway of migratory bird or have it own resident bird life clam crab and other marine life may add interest at coastal area each area have it own historical interest with which much can be do park visitor be always eager to learn more about the area they be in the historical sign tell it story but nothing get interest across a well a some of the original historical item or place themselves which still have the character of the period cover notice should be take of unusual rock formation deposit or shape of the earth s crust in you region those which tell a story of the earth s formation in each area can add geological interest to the recreation site an old shipwreck a high dam an old cover bridge a place to find agate or other semi-precious stone or a place to pan gold etcetera may be of interest some area may provide archeological value such a ancient indian village site or hunt area cave artifact etcetera how well can the site be develop look at the physical feature of the land to determine how desirable it be for use what can be do to correct the fault and what it will cost to make the area meet you need in comparison to other site many thing need to be check size and shape the size of the area alone can be a determine factor an area may be too small for the need of the project area should be large enough to include the attraction have ample space for the use of facility need and have room around the edge to protect the value of the area from encroachment by private development acreage in excess of the minimum be good practice a recreation area be never too large for the future and it be often more economical to operate one large area than several small one shape of the area be also relate to the use attraction and need of the development a large picnic area or camp development be most efficient in shape a a square or rectangle several hundred foot in width in preference to a long narrow area less than one hundred foot wide this be true because of saving in utility line and the fact that you building have a useful radius equal in all direction however a narrow strip may be very practical for small development or to provide additional stream frontage for a fisherman s trail or include scenic strip within the park unit adjoin area the value of the site may be affect by the appearance of the adjoin land ownership and use of the land and the utility available there for instance a site adjoin other publicly own land such a a national forest or a public road may be desirable whereas a site next to an industrial plant might not the utility available nearby may provide a saving in the cost of extend electricity or water to the site topography topography be very important check the elevation of the ground degree and direction of slope drainage rock outcrop topsoil type and quality a well a subsoil nearly level area be require for park area beach camp area ballfields etcetera determine how much topography limit useful area or what the cost of earth move or grade might be water in addition to it recreation interest water be need for drink sanitation and irrigation the quantity and quality of water source be often a big factor in site selection the area may provide good spring or opportunity for a well or be near to municipal water line figure the cost of provide water to the use area plant the exist plant growth call for thorough check look at the tree a to size and interest the amount of shade they provide how healthy they be the problem of maintenance fire hazard wind throw etcetera an area may have be partially log and require removal of stump or clean-up some shrub may be of good landscape value other area of brush may need to be clear the extent and location of open area be note exposure how much will wind rain sun and temperature affect the use an area shelter from strong wind may be highly desirable for recreation use the direction velocity and season of these wind should be note a to just how they will affect the recreation use and you maintenance and operation of the area lack of rainfall and extreme temperature may call for the development of shade and irrigation of a site to make it useable sometimes you have a choice of exposure for site where the topography or tree of the area will provide afternoon shade morning sun or whatever may be most desirable for the use intend improvement some area may already have be improve and contain building road utility clear land etcetera which may raise the cost of the site
