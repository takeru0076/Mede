the bishop look at he coldly and say take it or leave it literally there be nothing else to do he be catch in a machine but sojourner be not easily excite or upset and say quite calmly let s go and see what it s like annisberg be about seventy-five mile west of birmingham near the georgia border and on the tallahoosa river a small and dirty stream the city be a center of manufacture especially in textile and also because of the beauty of some of it surroundings a residence for many owner of the great industry in north alabama but it have a be usual in southern city of this sort a black bottom a low region near the river where the negroes live servant and laborer huddle together in a region with no sewage save the river where street and sidewalk be neglect and where there be much poverty and crime wilson come by train from birmingham and look the city over the rather pleasant white city be on the hill where the chief store be beyond be industry and factory then they go down to black bottom in the midst of this crowd region be the allen african methodist episcopal church it be an old and dirty wooden structure sadly in need of repair but it be a landmark it have be there 50 year or more and everybody in town black and white know of it it have just suffer a calamity the final crisis in a long series of calamity for the old preacher who have be there twenty-five year be dead and the city mourn he he be a loud-voiced man once vigorous but for many year now decline in strength and ability he be stern and overbearing with he flock but obsequious and conciliatory with the white especially the rich who partly support the church the deacon board head by a black man name carlson have practically take over a the pastor grow old and have it way with the support of the amen corner the characteristic thing about this church be it amen corner and the weekly religious orgy a knot of old worshipper chiefly woman listen weekly to a sermon it begin invariably in low tone almost conversational and then gradually work up to high shrill appeal to god and man and then the amen corner take hold re-enact a form of group participation in worship that stem from year before the greek chorus spread down through the african forest overseas to the west indies and then here in alabama with shout and slow dance with tear and song with scream and contortion the corner group be beset by hysteria and shiver wail shout possession of something that seem like an alien and outside force it spread to most of the audience and be often view by visit white who snicker behind handkerchief and afterward discuss negro religion it sometimes end in death-like trance with many lie exhaust and pant on chair and floor to most of those who compose the amen corner it be a magnificent and beautiful experience something for which they live from week to week it be often re-enact in less wild form at the wednesday night prayer meet wilson on he first sunday witness this with something like disgust he have preach a short sermon try to talk man-to-man to the audience to tell they who he be what he have do in macon and birmingham and what he propose to do here he sympathize with they on the loss of they old pastor but then at mention of that name the amen corner break loose he have no chance to say another word at the very end when the audience be silent and breathless a collection be take and then slowly everyone file out the audience do not think much of the new pastor and what the new pastor think of the audience he do not dare at the time to say during the next week he look over the situation first of all there be the parsonage an utterly impossible place for civilize people to live in originally poorly conceive apparently not repair for year with no plumbing or sewage with rat-hole and rot it be arrange that he would board in the home of one of the old member of the church a woman name catt who a wilson afterward find be briefly refer to a the cat because of she sharp tongue and fierce initiative ann catt be a lonely devote soul never marry conduct a spotless home and devote to she church but a perpetual dissenter and bear critic she soar over the new pastor like an avenging angel lest he stray from the path and not know all the truth and gossip of which she be chief repository then wilson look over the church and study it condition the salary of the pastor have for year be $ 500 annually and even this be in arrears wilson make up he mind that he must receive at least $ 2500 but when he mention this to the deacon they say nothing the church itself must be repair it be dirty and neglect it really ought to be rebuild and he determine to go up and talk to the city bank about this meanwhile the city itself should be talk to the street in the colore section be dirty there be typhoid and malaria the child have nowhere to go and no place to play not even sidewalk the school be small dark and ill-equipped the teacher be a pliant fool there be two liquor saloon not very far from the church one white that be conduct for white people with a side entrance for negroes the other exclusively negro undoubtedly there be a good deal of gamble in both on the other side of the church be a quiet well-kept house with shutter and recently paint wilson inquire about it it be call kent house the deacon of the church carlson be it janitor one of the lead member of the amen corner be cook there be two or three colore maid employ there wilson be tell that it be a sort of hotel for white people which seem to he rather queer why should a white hotel be set down in the center of black bottom but nevertheless it look respectable he be glad to have it there the rest of black bottom be a rabbit warren of home in every condition of neglect disrepair and careful upkeep dive carefully repair hut and nicely paint and ornament cottage be jumble together cheek by jowl with little distinction the good could not escape from the bad and the bad nestle cosily beside the good the yard front and back be narrow some be trash dump some have flower garden behind be privy for there be no sewage system after look about a bit wilson discover beyond black bottom across the river and far remove from the white city a considerable tract of land and it occur to he that the church and the good negro home might gradually be move to this plot he talk about it to the preside elder the preside elder look he over rather carefully he be not sure what kind of a man he have in hand but there be one thing that he have to stress and that be that the contribution to the general church expense the dollar money have be seriously fall behind in this church and that must be look after immediately in fact he intimate clearly that that be the reason that wilson have be send here to make a large contribution of dollar money wilson stress the fact that clear a this be they must have a good church a more business-like conduct of the church organization and an effort to get this religious center out of it rut of wild worship into a modern church organization he emphasize to the preside elder the plan of give up the old church and move across the river the preside elder be sure that that would be impossible but he tell wilson to go ahead and try and wilson try it do seem impossible the bank which hold the mortgage on the old church declare that the interest be considerably in arrears and the real estate people say flatly that the land across the river be be hold for an eventual development for white work people who be come in and that none would be sell to colore folk when it be propose to rebuild the church wilson find that the term for a new mortgage be very high he be sure that he could do good if he go to atlanta to get the deal finance but when this proposal be make to he deacon board he meet unanimous opposition the church certainly would not be remove the very proposition be sacrilege it have be here fifty year it be go to stay forever it be hardly possible to get any argument on the subject a for rebuild well that might be look into but there be no hurry no hurry at all wilson again go downtown to a different banker an intelligent young white man who seem rather sympathetic but he shake he head reverend he say i think you do nt quite understand the situation here do nt you see the amount of money that have be invest by white around that church tenement store saloon some gamble i hope not too much the colore people be get employment at kent house and other place and they be near they place of employment when a city have arrange thing like this you can not easily change they now if i be you i would just plan to repair the old church so it would last for five or ten year by that time perhaps something good can be do then wilson ask what about this kent house which you mention i do nt understand why a white hotel should be down here the young banker look at he with a certain surprise and then he say flatly i m afraid i can nt tell you anything in particular about kent house you ll have to find out about it on you own hope to see you again and he dismiss the colore pastor it be next day that sojourner come and sit beside he and take he hand she say i dear do you know what kent house be no say wilson i do nt i be just ask about it what be it it s a house of prostitution for white man with white girl a inmate they hire a good deal of local labor include two member of we trustee board they buy some supply from we colore grocer and they be patronize by some of the good white gentleman in town wilson stare at she i dear you must be mistake talk to mrs catt she say and after wilson have talk to mrs catt and to other he be absolutely amaze this of course be the sort of thing that use to take place in southern city put white house of prostitution with colore girl in colore neighborhood and carry they on openly but it have largely disappear on account of protest by the white and through grow resentment on the part of the negroes a they become more educate and get good wage but this situation of kent house be more subtle the wage involve be large and more regular the inmate be white and from out of town avoid local friction the back from the white town be great and there be little publicity good wage patronage and subscription of various kind stop open protest from negroes and yet wilson know that this place must go or he must go and for he to leave this job now without accomplish anything would mean practically the end of he career in the methodist church if not in all church
