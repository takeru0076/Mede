there be more stem per item in athabascan which express the fact that the athabascan language have undergo somewhat more change in diverge from proto-athabascan than the yokuts language from proto-yokuts this may be because the athabascan divergence begin early or again because the athabascan language spread over a very much large territory include three wholly separate area or both the differentiation however be not very much great a show by the fact that athabascan show 346 stem per mean slot a against 275 for yokuts with a slightly great number of language represent in we sample 24 a against 21 on deduction of one-eighth from 346 the stem item rate become 303 against 275 in equivalent number of language these general fact be mention to make clear that the total situation in the two family be similar enough to warrant comparison the great difference in the two set of figure be due to difference in the two set of list use these difference in turn result from the fact that i yokuts vocabulary be build up of term select mainly to insure unambiguity of english mean between illiterate informant and myself within a compact and uniform territorial area but that hoijer s vocabulary be base on swadesh s second glottochronological list which aim at eliminate all item which might be culturally or geographically determine swadesh in short be try to develop a basic list that be universal i one that be specifically adapt to the san joaquin valley the result be that i include 70 animal name but swadesh only 4 and somewhat similarly for plant 16 a against 4 swadesh and therefore hoijer feel compel to omit all term denote species or even genus ox vulture salmon yellow pine manzanita they class of animal and plant term be restrict to generalization or recurrent part fish bird tree grass horn tail bark root the group be therefore really non-comparable in content a well a in size other class be include only by myself interrogative adverb or only by swadesh and hoijer pronoun demonstrative what we have leave a reasonably comparable be four class 1 body part and product which with a proportionally nearly even representation 51 term out of 253 25 out of 100 come out with nearly even ratio 26 and 27 2 nature 29 term against 17 ratio 33 versus 41 3 adjective 16 15 term ratio 39 versus 47 4 verb 9 22 term ratio 40 versus 34 it will be see that where the scope be similar the athabascan ratio come out somewhat high a indeed they ought to with a total ratio of 28 a against 35 or 4 5 except for verb where alone the athabascan ratio be low this exception may be connect with hoijer s use of a much high percentage of verb 22 % of he total list a against 35 % in i or the exception may be due to a particular durability peculiar to the athabascan verb more word class ratio determine in more language will no doubt ultimately answer the question 5 if word class differ in they resistance or liability to stem replacement within mean slot it be conceivable that individual meaning also differ with fair consistence trans-lingually hoijer s athabascan and i yokuts share 71 identical meaning with allowance for several near-synonym like stomach-belly big-large long-far many-much die-dead say-speak for yokuts i tabulate these 71 item in five column accord a they be express by 1 2 3 4 and more than 4 stem the total for these five category be not too uneven namely 20 15 11 16 9 respectively for athabascan with a great range of stem the first two of five correspond column be identical 1 and 2 stem the three other have to be spread somewhat and be head respectively afj afj and afj stem while the particular limit of these grouping may seem artificially arbitrary they do fairly express a correspond group of more variable material and they eventuate also in five class along a similar scale contain approximately equal number of case namely 19 14 15 11 12 in athabascan when now we count the frequency of the 71 item in the two language family appear in the same column or grade or one column or grade apart or two or three or four we find these difference afj this distribution can be summarize by average the distance in grade apart afj which divide by afj give a mean of 107 grade apart if the distribution of the 71 item be wholly concordant in the two family the distance would of course be 0 if it be wholly random and unrelated it would be 20 assume the five class be equal in n which approximately they be the actual mean of 107 be about halfway between 0 of complete correlation and 20 of no correlation it be evident that there be a pretty fair degree of similarity in the behavior even of particular individual item of mean a regard long-term stem displacement 6 in 1960 david d thoma publish basic vocabulary in some mon-khmer language al 2 no 3 p 7 - 11 which compare 8 mon-khmer language with the i-e language data on which swadesh base the revise retention rate afj in place of original afj and he revise 100 word basic glottochronological list in towards great accuracy ijal 21 121 - 137 thoma finding be first that the individual item vary greatly and unpredictably in they persistence but second that the semantic group be surprisingly unvarying in they average persistence a between m-k and i-e he first conclusion on behavior of individual item be negative whereas i on ath and yok be partially positive he second conclusion on semantic word class agree with i this second conclusion independently arrive at by independent study of material from two pair of language family a different and remote from one another a these four be can not be ignore thoma also present a simple equation for derive an index of persistence which weight not only the number of stem root per mean but they relative frequency thus he persistence value for some stem frequency per mean be stem identical in 8 language 100 % stem frequency 7 and 1 86 % stem frequency 4 and 4 64 % stem frequency 4 3 and 1 57 % he formula will have to be weigh may be alter or improve and it should be test on additional body of material but consideration of the frequency of stem per constant mean seem to be establish a have significance in comparative situation with diachronic and classificatory relevance and gleason presumably be on the way with a far contribution in this area a to relative frequency of compete root 7 - 1 vs 4 - 4 etc thoma with he weight seem to be the first to have consider the significance this might have the problem need far exploration i be at least conscious of the distinction in i full yokuts presentation that await publication in which in list two-stem meaning i set off by asterisk those form in which n of stem b be afj of stem a3 the unasterisked one stand for afj or under four stem i set off by asterisk case where the combine n of stem afj be af 7 these finding and other which will in time be develop will affect the method of glottochronological inquiry if adjectival meaning show relatively low retentiveness of stem a i be confident will prove to be the case in most language of the world why should we basic list include 15 per cent of these unstable form but only 8 per cent of animal and plant which replace much more slowly have hoijer substitute for he 15 adjectival slot 15 good animal and plant item he rate of stem replacement would have be low and the age of athabascan language separation small and irrespective of the outcome in century elapse since split calculation obviously carry more concordant and comparable mean if they deal with the most stable unit than with variously unstable one it be evident that swadesh have not only have much experience with basic vocabulary in many language but have acquire great tact and feel for the expectable behavior of lexical item why then this urge to include unstable item in he basic list it be the urge to obtain a list a free of geographical and cultural condition a possible and why that insistence it be the hope of attain a list of item of universal occurrence but it be become increasingly evident that such a hope be a snare not that such a list can not be construct but the near it come to attain universality the less significant will it be linguistically it term will tend to be labile or vague and they will fit actual language more and more badly the practical operational problem of lexicostatistics be the establishment of a basic list of item of mean against which the particular form or term of language can be match a the medium of comparison the most important quality of the meaning be that they should be a definable a possible in proportion a meaning be concrete we can good rely on they be insulate and distinctive an elephant or a fox or a swan or a cocopalm or a banana possess in unusually high degree this quality of obvious common-sense indubitable identity a do an eye or tooth or nail they isolate out easily naturally and unambiguously from the continuum of nature and existence and they should be give priority in the basic list a long a they continue to show these quality with the universal list a he weapon swadesh have extend he march of conquest far and far into the past eight ten twelve millennia back and he have proclaim great or less affiliation between all western hemisphere language some of this may prove to be true or even considerable of it whether by genetic ramification or by diffusion and coalescence but the far out he move the thin will be he hold on conclusive evidence and the large the speculative component in he inference he have traverse province and kingdom but he have not consolidate they behind he nor do he control they he have announce result on hokan penutian uto-aztecan and almost all other american family and phyla and have diagram they degree of interrelation but he have not work out by lexicostatistics one comprehensively complete classification of even a single family other than salish that be he privilege the remote cloudy possible have value of it own value of scope stimulus potential and imagination but there be also a firm aspect to lexicostatistics the aspect of learn the internal organization of obvious natural genetic group of language a well a they more remote and elusive external link of classification first with elapse age merely a by-product of acquire evidential knowledge of what happen in athabascan in yokuts in uto-aztecan in the last few thousand year a well a forecast what more anciently may have happen between they this involve step-by-step progress and such will have to be the day-by-day work of lexicostatistics a a grow body of scientific inquiry if of the founder of glottochronology swadesh have escape we steady plod and lee have repudiate he own share in the found that be no reason why we should swerve 8 there be no apparent reason why we should feel bind by swadesh s rule and procedure since he predilection and aim have grow so vast it seem time to consider a revision of operational procedure for lexicostatistic study on a more humble solid and limit basis i would propose first an abandonment of attempt at a universal lexical list a intrinsically unachievable and operationally inadequate in proportion a it be achieve i would propose next a the prime requirement for constitution of new basic list item whose form show a high an empirical retention rate a possible there would be no conceivable sense in go to the opposite extreme of select item whose form be the most unstable an attempt middle course might lead to device like a 5000-word alphabetized dictionary from which every fiftieth word be select
