few people to whom we dear friend deppy have write deppy be despina messinesi a long-time member of the vogue staff who although bear in boston be bear there of greek parent several year of she life

i that very few friend of mutual friend long to see foreign stranger but i plan on be the soul of tact of give they plenty of out be there the tiny implication that they cup be already run over without we i diplomacy be needless greek phone service be bad than french so that it be to be some little time before contact of any sort be establish in the late afternoon mando come back to fetch we and we drive to the acropolis we stop first at the amphitheater that lie at the foot of the height crown by the parthenon the curve bench be break chip tumble but still in place a be the marble chair the seat of honor for the legislator the carve statue of the frieze against the low wall be for the most part headless but they exquisitely graceful nude and drape torso and the kneel atlante be well preserve in they perfect proportion have complete we camera work we start we climb i suppose the same emotion hold if to a lesser degree with any famous monument will it live up to it reputation the weight of fame and history be formidable and dreary steel engraving in schoolbook do little to quicken interest and imagination uh huh we think look at they so that s the parthenon and then perhaps one day we get to athens we be here we ve come a long way and spend a lot of money it have good be good do nt worry about the acropolis it be awe-inspiring probably every visitor have a favorite time for he first sight of it we see it frequently afterward but we suggestion for the very first encounter be near sunset the light at that time be a benediction the serene majestic column of the parthenon tawny in color against the pure deep blue sky frame incredible vista all we want to do be to stand very quietly and look and look and look more than twenty-four hundred year old bruise batter wear and partially destroy combine to an astound degree solidity and grace it still stand incomparable testimony to man s aspiration in 1687 the turk who have be in control of the city since the fifteenth century with a truly shatter lack of prudence use the parthenon a a powder magazine it be hit by a shell fire by the bombard venetian army and the great central portion of the temple be blow to smithereen nearby be the temple of athena the architectural feature the caryatides uphold the portico famous around the world a the porch of the maiden be refer to airily by mando a the girl place another beautiful build be the propylaea the entrance gate of the acropolis i other nugget of art and architectural knowledge besides remember that it be ghiberti who design the door of the baptistery in florence be the three style of greek column for some happy reason doric ionic and corinthian have always stick in i mind furthermore i can identify each design it remain however for mando to teach i that doric symbolize strength ionic wisdom and corinthian beauty the three pillar of the ancient world the column of the parthenon be flute doric another classic sight that give we considerable pleasure be the evzone sentry in he ballet skirt with great pompon on he shoe who be patrol up and down in front of the palace gun on shoulder he would march smartly for a few yard bring he heel together with a click make a brisk pirouette skirt flare and march back to he point of departure we do not dare speak to so exalt a be but norton aim he camera and shoot he so to speak on the rise the split second between the halt and the turn the even of we first day we drive with christopher and judy sakellariadis who be friend and patient of norton to dine at a restaurant on the shore of the aegean on the way out mr sakellariadis detour up a special hill from which one may obtain a matchless view of the acropolis light by night the great spectacle be a source of rancor and son et lumiere which the french be try to promote with the athenian be the reason these performance be be stage at historical monument throughout europe by a combination of music light effect and narration famous event that have transpire in these location be evoke and re-creat for large audience usually to considerable acclaim the acropolis have be schedule for the treatment too but apparently it be to take place at the time of the full moon when the athenian themselves out of respect for the natural beauty of the occasion be wont to forgo they own usual nocturnal illumination athenian society be split into two faction the philistine and the artist the artist contend that the philistine gross of soul be all for have son et lumiere since the french be foot the bill and the attraction wherever it have be do have prove popular this be the crass kind of materialism and they the artist would have no truck with it the acropolis be unique in the world and if that imcomparable work flood by moonlight be nt enough for both native and tourist then they be quite simply barbarian and the hell with they it be very stimulate the restaurant to which the sakellariadises take we on this night of controversy be the asteria on asteria beach this be a public bathing beach easily accessible by tramway from the center of athens office worker frequently go out there to lunch and swim during the siesta period which during the summer last from two until five in the afternoon when shop and office be again open for business they close sometime after eight nine oclock be the rush hour when the buss be jam and by nine-thirty the restaurant be begin to fill bedtime be late for the balmy evening be delightful and everyone want to linger under the star the sand be fine and pleasant the cabanas be clean and the parasol green raspberry and butter yellow be very gay although open to the general public it be not overcrowded the atmosphere be that of an attractive private beach club at home we go there a couple of time to swim and enjoy ourselves thoroughly this agreeable state of affair be explicable i think on two count one be greece be not yet suffer from overpopulation the public may still find pleasure in public place the other be that the charge for cabanas and parasol though modest from an american point of view still be a little high for many athenian we be strike by the notable absence of banana skin and beer can but just so that we would nt go overboard on greek refinement perfection be side-step by a couple of bray portable radio greek boy and girl also go for rock-and-roll and the station most tune to be those carry unite state overseas program a good deal of english be speak on the beach most educate greek learn it in childhood and there be also american wife and child of we overseas serviceman for a delightful drive out of athens i should recommend sounion at the end of the attic peninsula the road a comparatively new one be very good wind along inlet cove and bay of deep and brilliant blue i suppose the day will inevitably come when the area will be encrust with development but at present it be desert and seductive three beneficial hurdle to progress be the lack of water electricity and telephone at sounion there be a group of beautiful column the ruin of a temple to poseidon of particular interest at that time a active reconstruction be in progress gaunt scaffolding adjoin the ruin and on the ground segment of column two and a half to three foot in thickness be be fit with section cunningly chiseled to match exactly the flute and proportion of the original late they would be hoist into place there be a mediocre restaurant at sounion and i feed a thin little grecian cat and give it two saucer of water there be no milk which it lap up a though it be nectar i think it thirst have never be assuage before norton and i dine one night in a sea-food restaurant in piraeus right on the water s edge to enter it you go down five or six step from the road across the road be the kitchen and waiter bear great tray of dish dodge traffic a nimbly a they french colleague at the restaurant in the place do tertre in paris this restaurant too have a cat a dusty thin little creature how can a cat be thin in a fish restaurant but this one be when offer a morsel it glance right and leave and wince obviously frighten and expect a kick but too hungry not to snatch the tidbit greece be one of the highlight of we trip but begin in greece and continue around the world throughout southeast asia the treatment of animal be horrifying range from callous indifference to active cruelty this of course be not true of the educate and sophisticate people we meet who love they pet but kindness be not a basic human instinct we meet some charm athenian and among they we chauffeur panyotis rank high he english be limit and the little he know he find irritate a particularly galling phrase be ok panyotis we have time at we disposal this he claim be the favorite refrain of the english they would be loll under a tree sip ouzo relish the leisurely life assure he that the day be yet young
