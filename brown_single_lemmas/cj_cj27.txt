with this evidence in mind the writer begin to plan how he might more effectively educate the marry student in he functional class toward the end of the semester s work he interview every marry class member at great length he find a he have suspect a general consensus that perhaps over half of the present functionally design course be not really functional for these student however all admit that the hindsight be not altogether lose in they own word it have aid they to get a clear picture of how they have get into they marriage and perhaps they have obtain some insight on why certain trouble appear from time to time in fact they go so far a to caution the writer that if he attempt to design a section exclusively for marry student there should be at the begin some hindsight study but they all hasten to add that certainly less time be need on it than presently spend all of they feel a compel need for more coverage on area that could be only lightly touch upon in a general survey functional course a few be doubtful about the merit of an exclusive section for marry student a one of they express it it have do i a world of good to listen to the naive question and comment of these not-yet-married people i can now good see just what process provoke certain action from i in the past have i be in an all-married section i would have miss this and i believe that this single aspect have be of great personal value to i this comment and other similar to it would seem to indicate a possible justification for continue the status quo but the weight of feel be heavily in the opposite direction thus the writer decide to hold one experimental section of the functional preparation for marriage course in the spring semester of 1960 exclusively for person already marry that be prerequisite marriage this do not mean that marry student could not enroll in other mix section and some of they largely because of schedule difficulty do but only those already marry could enroll in this one section in addition two other difference in the two type of section must be note 1 the regular section do not allow freshman this one do this action be rationalize on the basis of a small survey which indicate that a high percentage of marry freshman woman on we campus never become sophomores many of they appear to drop out for one reason or another by permit freshman student we might extend the opportunity for such a course to some individual who otherwise might never get to take it this have subsequently be verify by the experience 2 auditor be encourage in the regular section they have always be more or less discourage the philosophy have be that if they could find the time to attend class why not encourage they to get the credit and perhaps provide an incentive to do the work more effectively besides auditor do not count on faculty load with the same weight a regularly enrol student but in this one section we welcome auditor why for no particular reason other than that the writer feel it might just might encourage both mate to be in attendance many of the man on we campus have a pretty set curriculum especially in the various engineering field with few elective till the senior year incidentally it need to be note that because auditor be permit the section begin increase in number each week until at last it swell to such proportion that this free audit policy have to be retract after that we begin to get visitor to class this experimental class represent quite a variety of student it range from a freshman woman just marry through the various academic growth stage include one senior-graduate student to a young faculty member recently marry to a senior man who also attend it range from those with no child through student in various stage of pregnancy to one 44-year-old male with four child three of whom be teenager it range from two woman member who have experience premarital pregnancy to one couple twelve year marry and seemingly unable to conceive one might digress at this point and speculate that if it be wise to create special section for special status then why not a special section for woman pregnant before marriage and one for 44-year-old man with teenage child and so on some of these speculation may have some merit other be somewhat ambiguous but few who have experience marriage can dispute the fact that the focus of interpersonal relationship be different in marriage than in a pre-marital situation the writer begin this special class by explain he background think for create such a section in the first place he make it clear from the begin that this be the student opportunity and that the future destiny of such group depend on favorable result from this one he do build a framework of academic respectability and one which do not encroach upon the sacred sovereignty of any other exist campus course this be to say that this be not a course in wise buy or money spend method nor a course in how to raise child we already have course cover those problem and so on but within that framework he allow for a much flexibility a possible a steer committee of student be organize on the first day whose duty it be to be alert and constantly evaluate and re-evaluate the direction and pace the class be take the writer be cognizant through he interview of the reaction of previous marry student do insist on there be include some hindsight material but the great part of semester time be actually center around the attitude so we be marry now how do we make the good of it or how do we enrich we already fine marriage film be use a with all section but with one big difference we campus unfortunately own no film since they be all either rent or borrow the request date for they use have to be far in advance the writer never know from week to week just where the section might be for example the steer committee might announce that the group feel a topic under study should not be drop for an additional week a there be still too much of it untouched since the writer have establish this democratic procedure in the begin he have to go along with they decision after of course point out whether he think they decision be a wise or an unwise one thus the film see a they come in coordinate for the regular section be often out of context nevertheless the writer have never experience such spontaneity of discussion after film showing though it do not become know to the writer for some time a nucleus group have spring up within the class they begin to meet in the evening and carry forward various discussion they feel not fully enough cover in class from a few student this group gradually increase to include over three-fourths of those officially enrol in the class and many outsider a well also although only a few of the student be intimately acquaint with each other in the begin most report that when the semester end they dear and close campus friendship be with member of that class in fact they often revamp they social activity to include class member previously unknown supplemental outside read report be handle just a in the other section the major difference be that there be a noticeably deep level in the report outside read by the marry group these student although they might read various article in popular magazine more often choose to report on article find in the journal in addition to the noticeable difference in outside article there be a considerable difference in the outside book they read whereas a high percentage of the regular student can be expect to read other text which more or less plow the same ground in a little different direction the marry student choose whole book on specific area and go into much great detail in they area of interest since the writer have not notice this characteristic in marry student scatter throughout the various section previous to this experiment nor a a matter of fact in those who be continue in single section he can only conclude that there must have be something contagious within the specific group which cause this to occur in the main this course take the follow directional high road 1 a great deal of time be spend on process for solve marital difference this be not a search for a magic formula but rather an examination of basic principle pertain especially to all type of communication in marriage in short it be center around learn how to develop a more sensitive empathy not until the group be satisfy in this area be they will to venture far to 2 specific adjustment area such a sex in-law religion finance and so on from here they proceed to 3 these same area in relation to they own future family life stage develop these to the extent of examine various crisis which could be expect to confront they at some time or other a an example of this last facet there be some lengthy discussion center around bereavement mainly these be concern with the possibility of the death of one parent and the complication of live with the survivor afterward but the possible death of one s own spouse be not overlook since the course one member have lose she husband this be not a particularly shock or unexpect thing it be previously know to she that it might happen but just when be an unknown and of course the long it do not happen the strong she wish and belief that it might not since she bereavement this individual have report to the writer on numerous occasion about how helpful the class discussion be to she in this adjustment crisis quite frequently class member bring question from they mate at home these be often carefully write out with a great deal of think behind they this add a personal zest to class discussion and participation both sex report that the discussion on sex adjustment within marriage be extremely enlighten the writer sense a much free and more frank discussion especially of this one area than ever before he feel certain for the first time in he teach experience that the man in the class understand that orgasm a a criterion be not nearly so essential for a satisfy female sexual experience a most male might think this be probably much more meaningful because all the woman in the class emphasize it time and again on the other hand the woman class member appear to reach a far great understand than have woman member in other section that it be more natural for male a a group to view sex a sex rather than always associate it with love a most woman seem to do in the reproductive area it could be readily observe that all feel free to discuss thing than student have previously in mix marital status section perhaps this be relate to the fact that all be in on it to some extent never in other section have there be the opportunity for the genuine down-to-earth discussion about the feeling of both spouse during various stage of pregnancy there be a particularly marvelous opportunity for study in this area since almost every stage of pregnancy be represent from a childless couple to and include every trimester in fact we have one birth before the end of the course and another student have to take the final examiantion a week early just to be on the safe side there be also one spontaneous abortion during the semester
