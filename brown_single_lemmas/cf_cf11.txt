parent tell he they want to take he to an orthodontist a dentist who specialize in realign tooth and jaw they young son be interest during the year that follow dick co-operate whole-heartedly with the dentist and be delight with the final result achieve an upper row of strong straight tooth that completely change he facial appearance richard stewart be no special case the majority of child in the unite state could benefit by some form of orthodontic treatment say dr allan g brodie professor and head of the department of orthodontic at the university of illinois and a nationally recognize authority in he field what do parent need to know about those year of the brace in order not to waste a child s time and they money how can they tell whether a child need orthodontic treatment why and when should tooth-straightening be undertake what be it likely to cost tooth fit explain occlusion be the dentist s expression for the way tooth fit together when the jaw be close malocclusion or a bad fit be what parent need to look out for one main type of malocclusion be characterize by a recede chin and protrude upper front tooth a chin too prominent in relation to the rest of the face a thrust forward of the low front tooth an overdeveloped low jawbone and an underdeveloped upper jaw indicate the opposite type of malocclusion these two basic malformation have of course many variation a child probably require some form of treatment if he have any of the follow condition a noticeable protrusion of the upper or low jaw crook overlap twist or widely space tooth front tooth not meet when the back tooth close upper tooth completely cover the lower when the back tooth close the eyeteeth third from the middle on top count each front tooth a the first begin to protrude like fang second tooth that have come in before the first one have fall out make a double row contrary to the think of 30 to 40 year ago when all malocclusion be blame on some unfortunate habit recent study show that most tooth irregularity have at least it begin in hereditary predisposition however this do not mean that a child s tooth or jaw must necessarily resemble those of someone in he family tooth deformity may be the result of excessive thumb - or finger-sucking tongue-thrusting or lip-sucking but it s important to remember that there s a difference between normal and excessive suck habit it s perfectly normal for baby to suck they thumb and no mother need worry if a child continue this habit until he be two or three year old occasional suck up to the fifth year may not affect a youngster s tooth but after that if thumb-sucking pressure be frequent it will have an effect malocclusion can also result if baby tooth be lose too soon or retain too long if a child lose a molar at the age of two the adjoin tooth may shift toward the empty space thus narrow the place intend for the permanent one and produce a jumble if baby tooth be retain too long the income second tooth may be prevent from emerge at the normal time or may have to erupt in the wrong place correction can save tooth every orthodontist see child who be embarrass by they malformed tooth some such youngster rarely smile or they try to speak with the mouth close in certain case a in dick stewart s a child s personality be affect yet from the dentist s point of view bad-fitting tooth should be correct for physical reason bad alignment may result in early loss of tooth through a breakdown of the bony structure that support they root this serious condition popularly know a pyorrhea be one of the chief cause of tooth loss in adult then too misplace or jammed-together tooth be prone to trap food particle increase the likelihood of rapid decay for these and other reason say dr brodie orthodontic can prolong the life of tooth the failure of tooth to fit together when close interfere with normal chew so that a child may swallow food whole and put a burden on he digestive system because of these chew trouble a child may avoid certain food he need for adequate nutrition badly place tooth can also cause such a speech handicap a lisp the when and how of straighten most orthodontic work be do on child between the age of 10 and 14 though there have be patient a young a two and a old a 55 say dr brodie in the period from 10 to 14 the permanent set of tooth be usually complete yet the continue growth of bony tissue make move badly place tooth comparatively easy orthodontic work be possible because tooth be hold firmly but not rigidly by a system of peridontal membrane with an involve nerve network to the bone in the jaw they be not anchored directly to the bone abnormal pressure apply over a period of time produce a change in the bony deposit so a tooth function normally in the new position into which it have be guide what can 10-year-old susan expect when she enter the orthodontist s office on she first visit the orthodontist will take x-ray photograph tooth measurement and tooth print an impression of the mouth that permit he to study she tooth and jaw if he decide to proceed he will custom-make for susie an appliance consist of band plastic plate fine wire and tiny spring this appliance will exert a gentle and continuous or intermittent pressure on the bone a the tooth move bone cell on the pressure side of it will dissolve and new one will form on the side from which the tooth have move this must be do at the rate at which new bony tissue grow and no fast if tooth be move too rapidly serious injury can be do to they root a well a to the surround bone hold they in place explain dr brodie move one or two tooth can affect the whole system and an ill-conceived plan of treatment can disrupt the growth pattern of a child s face during the first few day of wear the appliance and immediately follow each adjustment susan may have a slight discomfort or soreness but after a short time this will disappear parent be often concern that orthodontic appliance may cause tooth to decay when in place a well-cemented band actually protect the part of the tooth that be cover next susie will enter the treatment stage and visit the orthodontist once or twice a month depend on the severity of she condition during these visit the dentist will adjust the brace to increase the pressure on she tooth last come the retention stage susie s tooth have now be guide into a desirable new position but because tooth sometimes may drift back to they original position a retain appliance be use to lock they in place usually this be a thin band of wire attach to the molar and stretch across the tooth susie may wear this only at night or for a few hour during the day then come the time when the last wire be remove and susie walk out a healthy and more attractive girl than when she first go to the orthodontist how long will this take straighten one tooth that have come in wrong may take only a few month align all the tooth may take a year or more an add complication such a a malformed jaw may take two or three year to correct what be the cost the charge for a complete full-banded job differ in various part of the country work that might cost $ 500 to $ 750 in the south could cost $ 750 to $ 1200 in new york city or chicago an average national figure for two to three year of treatment would be $ 650 to $ 1000 factor in the cost of treatment be the length of time involve and the skill and education of the practitioner say dr brodie to become an orthodontist a man must first be license by he state a a dentist then he must spend at least two year in additional train to acquire a license a a specialist cost may seem high but they use to be even high say dr brodie fee be about half to a third of what they be 25 year ago the reason people today be aware of the value of orthodontic and a a result there be more practitioner in the field most orthodontists require an initial payment to cover the cost of diagnostic material and construction of the appliance but usually the remainder of the cost may be spread over a period of month or year in many city in the unite state clinic associate with dental school will take patient at a nominal fee some municipal agency will pay for orthodontic treatment for child of needy parent research help family growth study have be carry on consistently by orthodontists dr brodie have 30-year record of head growth start 20 minute after child s birth in the past anyone who say that 90 % of all malocclusion be hereditary be scoff at now we know that family characteristic do affect tooth formation to a large extent he say fortunately through we growth study we have be able to see what nature do and that help we know what we can do this knowledge both modify and dictate diagnosis and treatment for example a boy may inherit a small jaw from one ancestor and large tooth from another in the past an orthodontist might have try over four or five year to straighten and fit the boy s large tooth into a jaw that despite some growth would never accommodate they now a dentist can recommend extraction immediately in other case in view of present-day knowledge of head growth orthodontists will recommend wait four or five year before treatment the child be keep on call and the orthodontist watch the growth nature often take care of the problem say dr brodie a child with a certain type of head and tooth will outgrow tooth deformity that be why dr brodie ask parent not to insist against they dentist s advice that they child have orthodontic work do too early both because of we culture s stress on beauty and we improve economic condition some parent demand that the dentist try to correct a problem before it be wise to do so let the orthodontist decide the proper time to start treatment he urge superior new material for orthodontic work be another result of research plastic be easy to handle than the vulcanized rubber formerly use and they save time and money plaster of paris once utilize in make impression of tooth have be replace by alginate gelatin-like material that work quickly and accurately and with least discomfort to a child prevention be good a a rule the early general dental treatment be start the less expensive and more satisfactory it be likely to be after you child s baby tooth be all in usually at the age of two and one half to three it s time for that first dental appointment dr brodie advise then see that you youngster have a routine checkup once a year to help prevent orthodontic problem from arise you dentist can do these thing he can correct decay thus prevent early loss of tooth if a child do lose he first tooth prematurely because of decay and if no preventive step be take the other tooth may shift out of position become overcrowded and malformed in turn the other tooth be likely to decay because food particle may become impact in they
