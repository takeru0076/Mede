unfortunately however and for reason to be discuss in the follow chapter no rate relationship can be make completely nondiscriminatory a long a all or some of the rate must be set above marginal cost in order to yield adequate revenue and this fact may explain some of the disagreement among the expert a to the more rational formula for the apportionment of total cost among different unit of service one such disagreement which will receive attention in this next chapter concern the question whether rate for different kind of service in order to avoid the attribute of discrimination must be make directly proportional to marginal cost or whether they should be base instead on difference in marginal cost here the choice be that between the horn of a dilemma two major type of fully distribute cost analysis 1 the double-step type despite an ambiguity due to it failure clearly to define relative cost the above exposition of fully distribute cost go about a far a one can go toward express the basic philosophy of the practice for more explicit exposition one must distinguish different type of analysis by all mean the most important distinction be that between those total-cost apportionment which superimpose a distribution of admittedly unallocable cost residue on estimate of incremental or marginal cost and those other apportionment which recognize no difference between true cost allocation and mere total-cost distribution the first or double-step type might also be call the railroad type because of it application to railroad and other transportation agency by the cost section of the interstate commerce commission the cost section distinguish between directly variable cost and constant cost in a manner note in the precede chapter the variable cost alone be assign to the different unit of freight traffic a represent long-run out-of-pocket cost a term with a mean here not distinctly different from that of the economist s long-run marginal cost there remain a residue of total cost or total revenue requirement which since it be find to behave a if it be constant over substantial variation in traffic density be strictly unallocable on a cost-finding basis nevertheless because the cost section have feel impel to make some kind of a distribution of total cost it have apportion this residue which it sometimes call burden among the unit of carload traffic on a basis partly ton partly ton-mile which be concededly quite arbitrary from the standpoint of cost determination in recent year this burden which include allowance for revenue deficiency in the passenger business and in less-than-carload freight traffic have amount to about one third of those total revenue requirement which the carload freight business be suppose to be call upon to meet since this book be concern only incidentally with railroad rate it will not attempt to analyze the method by which the staff of the interstate commerce commission have estimate out-of-pocket cost and apportion residue cost suffice it to say that the usefulness of the latter apportionment be questionable but in any event full credit should be give to the cost section for it express and overt recognition of a vital distinction too often ignore in utility-cost analysis namely that between a cost allocation design to reflect the actual behavior of cost in response to change in rate of output of different class of utility service and a mere cost apportionment which somehow spread among the class and unit of service even those cost that be strictly unallocable from the standpoint of specific cost determination 2 the single-step type we turn now to a type of fully distribute cost analysis which unlike the railroad type draw no distinction between cost allocation and cost apportionment the single-step type it might be call the public utility type because of the considerable use to which it have be put in gas and electric utility rate case here no attempt be make first to determine out-of-pocket or marginal cost and then to superimpose on these cost reasonably distribute residue of total cost instead all of the total cost be treat a variable cost although these cost be divide into cost that be deem to be function of different variable moreover whereas in interstate commerce commission parlance variable cost mean a cost deem to vary in direct proportion to change in rate of output in the type of analysis now under review variable cost have be use more broadly so a to cover cost which while a function of some one variable such a output of energy or number of customer be not necessarily a linear function a already note in an early paragraph the more familiar cost analysis of utility enterprise or utility system divide the total cost among a number of major class of service such a residential commercial industrial power street light etc this grand division permit many cost to be assign in they entirety to some one class such a street light or at least to be exclude completely from some important class or class high-tension industrial power service for example would not be charge with any share of the maintenance cost or capital cost of the low-tension distribution line but the major portion of the total cost of a utility business be common or joint to all or nearly all class of customer and these cost must somehow be apportion among the various class and then must somehow be reapportion among the unit of service in order to report unit cost that can serve a tentative measure of reasonable rate the general basis on which these common cost be assign to differently measure unit of service will be illustrate by the follow highly simplify problem of an electric-utility cost analysis but before turn to this example we must distinguish two subtype of analysis both of which belong to the single-step type rather than to the double-step type in the first subtype the analyst follow the practice of railroad analysis in this particular respect distribute both total operate cost and total annual capital cost include an allowance for cost of capital or fair rate of return among the different class and unit of service here an apportionment say of $ 5000000 of the total cost to residential service a a class would include an allowance of perhaps 6 per cent a the cost of whatever capital be deem to have be devote to the service of the residential consumer but in the second subtype which i take to be the one more frequently apply only the operate expense and not the cost of capital or fair return be apportion directly among the various class of service to be sure the capital investment in or alternatively the estimate fair value of the plant and equipment be apportion among the different class a be also the gross revenue receive from the sales of the different service but any result excess of revenue receive from a give class of service over the operate cost impute to this class be report a a return realize on the capital investment attribute to the same service thus during any give year a if the revenue from the residential service be $ 7000000 b if the operate expense impute to this class of service come to $ 5000000 and c if the net investment in or value of the plant and equipment deem devote to this service amount to $ 30000000 the cost analyst will report that residential service in the aggregate have yield a return of $ 2000000 or 6-23 per cent other service will show different rate of return some probably much low and some high there be obvious reason of convenience for this practice of exclude cost of capital from the direct apportionment of annual cost among the different class of service notably the avoidance of the controversial question what rate of return should be hold to constitute cost of capital or fair rate of return but the practice be likely to be mislead since it may seem to support a conclusion that a long a the revenue from any class of service cover the impute operate expense plus some return on capital investment however low the rate of charge for this service be compensatory needless to say any such inference would be quite unwarranted for the reason just suggest i shall assume the use of the first subtype of fully distribute cost apportionment in the follow simplify example that be to say an allowance for cost of capital will be assume to be include directly in the cost apportionment three-part analysis of the cost of an electric utility business in order to simplify the exposition of a typical fully apportion cost analysis let we assume the application of the analysis to an electric utility company supply a single city with power generate by it own steam-generation plant let we also assume the existence of only one class or type of service all of which be supply at the same voltage phase etc to residential commercial and industrial customer this latter assumption will permit we to center attention on the most controversial aspect of modern public utility cost analysis the distinction among cost that be function of output of the same service measure along different dimension since the company under review be supply what we be here regard a only one kind of service we might suppose that the problem of total cost apportionment would be very simple indeed that it would be limit to a find of the total annual operate and capital cost of the business follow by a calculation of this total in term of annual cost per kilowatt-hour of consumption in fact however the problem be not so simple for a statement of cost per kilowatt-hour would ignore the fact that many of these cost be not a function of kilowatt-hour output or consumption of energy a recognition of multiple cost function be therefore require the simple division and the one most frequently use with subdivision in gas and electric rate case be a threefold division of the total operate and capital cost into customer cost energy or volumetric cost and demand or capacity cost if this threefold division of cost be to have it counterpart in the actual rate of charge for service a it actually do have in some rate there would result a three-part rate for any one class of service for example the monthly bill of a residential consumer might be the sum of a $ 1 customer charge a $ 5 charge for 250 kilowatt-hour of energy at per kilowatt-hour and a $ 2 charge for a maximum demand of 2 kilowatt during the month at the rate of $ 1 per kilowatt a total bill of $ 8 for that month but we present interest lie in the measurement of cost of service and only indirectly in rate that may or may not be design to cover these cost let we therefore consider each of the three type of cost in turn recognize that this simplify classification be use only for illustrative purpose cost actually vary in much more complex way 1 the customer cost these be those operate and capital cost find to vary with number of customer regardless or almost regardless of power consumption include a a minimum be the cost of meter and bill along with whatever other expense the company must incur in take on another consumer these minimum cost may come to $ 1 per month more or less for residential and small commercial customer although they be substantially high for large industrial user who require more costly connection and meter device while cost on this order be sometimes separately charge for in residential and commercial rate in the form of a mere service charge they be more frequently wholly or partly cover by a minimum charge which entitle the consumer to a very small amount of gas or electricity with no far payment but the really controversial aspect of customer-cost imputation arise because of the cost analyst s frequent practice of include not just those cost that can be definitely earmark a incur for the benefit of specific customer but also a substantial fraction of the annual maintenance and capital cost of the secondary low-voltage distribution system a fraction equal to the estimate annual cost of a hypothetical system of minimum capacity
