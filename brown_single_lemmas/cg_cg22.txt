do we society have a runaway uncontrollable growth of technology which may end we civilization or a normal healthy growth here there may be an analogy with cancer we can detect cancer by they rapidly accelerate growth determinable only when relate to the more normal rate of healthy growth should the accelerate growth of technology then warn we note such evidence be the first step and almost the only cure be early detection and removal one way to determine whether we have so dangerous a technology would be to check the strength of we society s organ to see if they function be a healthy a before so an objective look at we present procedure may move we to consider seriously this possibly analogous situation in any event whether society may have cancer or merely a virus infection the disease we shall find be political economical social and even medical have not we physical ability already deteriorate because of the more sedentary life we be now live hence the prime issue a i see it be whether a democratic or free society can master technology for the benefit of mankind or whether technology will rule and develop it own society compatible with it own need a a force of nature we be already commit to establish man s supremacy over nature and everywhere on earth not merely in the limit social-political-economical context we be fond of today otherwise we go on endlessly try to draw the line color and other a to which kind of man we wish to see dominate we have prove so able to solve technological problem that to contend we can not realize a universal goal in the immediate future be to be extremely shortsighted if nothing else we must believe we have the ability to affect we own destiny otherwise why try anything so in these page the term technology be use to include any and all mean which could amplify project or augment man s control over himself and over other man naturally this include all communication form eg language or any social political economic or religious structure employ for such control properly mindful of all the culture in existence today throughout the world we must employ these resource without war or violent revolution if we be create a wholly new society we could insist that we social political economic and philosophic institution foster rather than hamper man good growth but we can not start off with a clean slate so we must first analyze we present institution with respect to the effect of each on man s major need ask which institution most need correction i would say the corporation a it exist in america today at first glance this appear strange of all people be not america found by rugged individualist who establish a new way of life still inspire undeveloped society abroad but hear harrison e salisbury former moscow correspondent of the new york time and author of to moscow and beyond in a book review of the soviet cultural offensive he say long before the state department organize it bureaucracy into an east-west contact staff in order to wage a cultural counter-offensive within soviet border the sharp cutting-edge of american culture have carve it mark across the russian steppe a when the enterprising promoter of porgy and bess overrode the state department to carry the contemporary cultural warfare behind the enemy line they be not diplomat or jazz musician or even organizer of reading-room and photo-montage display but rugged capitalist entrepreneur like henry ford hugh cooper thoma campbell the international harvester co and david w griffith they kind create an american culture superior to any in the world an industrial and technological culture which penetrate russia a it do almost every corner of the earth without a nickel from the federal treasury or a single governmental specialist to contrive directive or program a series of consultation of interest agency this favorable image of america in the mind of russian man and woman be still there despite year of energetic anti-american propaganda corporation now outmoded perhaps the public s present attitude toward business stem from the fact that the rugged capitalist entrepreneur no more exist in america in he stead be a milquetoast version know a the corporation but even if we can not see the repulsive characteristic in this new image of america foreigner can and we loss of prestige abroad be the direct result no amount of ballyhoo will cover up the sordid fact if we want respect from ourselves or other we will have to earn it first let we realize that whatever good this set-up achieve in early time now the corporation per se can not take economic leadership business must develop a a result of the idea energy and ambition of an individual have purpose and comprehensive ability within one mind when we force individual to assume the corporate structure by mean of tax and other legal statute we adopt what i would term pseudo-capitalism and so take a major step toward socialism the big loss of course be the individual s lessen desire and ability to give he service to the growth of he company and we economy socialism i grant have a definite place in we society but let we not complain of the evil of capitalism by refer to a form that be not truly capitalistic some form of capitalism do indeed work superb organization a credit to any society but the pseudo-capitalism which dictate we whole economy a well a we politics and social life will not stand close scrutiny it pretense to operate in the public interest be little more than a sham it serve only it own stockholder and poorly at that a a creative enterprise it ability be primarily in swallow creative enterprise develop outside it own organization an ability make possible by we and almost mandatory a to benefit to employee it be notorious for it callous disregard except where it depend on they for service the corporation in america be in reality we form of socialism vie in a sense with the other socialistic form that have emerge within governmental bureaucracy but while the corporation have all the disadvantage of the socialist form of organization so cumbersome it can not constructively do much of anything not compatible with it need to perpetuate itself and maintain it status quo unluckily it do not have the desirable aspect of socialism the motivation to operate for the benefit of society a a whole so we be face with a vast network of amorphous entity perpetuate themselves in whatever manner they can without regard to the need of society control society and force upon it a regime represent only the corporation s need for survival the corporation have a limit specific place in we society ideally speak it should be allow to operate only where the public have a great stake in the continuity of supply or service and where the action of a single proprietor be secondary to the need of society example be in public utility make military aircraft and accessory or where the investment and risk for a proprietorship would be too great for a much need project impossible to achieve by any mean other than the corporate form eg construct major airport or dam thus if corporation be not to run away with we they must become quasi-governmental institution subject to public control and need in all other area private initiative of the proprietorship type should be urge to produce the desire goods and service proprietorship avoid runaway technology can be do only by assure a humane society and for this human being must be firmly in control of the economics on which we society rest such genuine human leadership the proprietorship can offer corporation can not it can project long-range goal for itself corporation react violently to short-range stimulus eg quarterly and annual dividend report proprietorship can establish a unity and integrity of control corporation be more amorphous can not proprietorship can establish a meaningful identity represent a human personality and thus establish sincere relationship with customer and community corporation be apt by nature to be impersonal inhumane shortsighted and almost exclusively profit-motivated a picture they could scarcely afford to present to the public the proprietor be able to create a leadership impossible in the corporate structure with it board of director and stockholder leadership be lack in we society because it have no legitimate place to develop man continuously at the head of grow enterprise can acquire experience of the most vary complicate and try type so that at maturation they have develop the competence and willingness to accept the personal responsibility so sorely need now hence government must establish great control upon corporation so that they activity promote what be deem essential to the national interest proprietorship should get the tax advantage now accrue to corporation eg the chance to accumulate capital so vital for growth corporation should pay add tax to be use for educational purpose not necessarily of the formal type the right to leave legacy should be substantially reduce and ultimately eliminate to perpetuate wealth control lead by small group of individual who play no role in it creation prevent those with real initiative from come to the fore and be basically anti-democratic when the proprietor die the establishment should become a corporation until it be either acquire by another proprietor or the government decide to drop it strike should be declare illegal against corporation because disagreement would have to be settle by government representative act a controller of the corporation whose responsibility to the state would now be define against proprietorship because employee and proprietor must be completely interdependent a they be each a part of the whole strike threaten the security of the proprietorship if internally motivate prevent a healthy relationship certainly external force should not be apply arbitrarily out of mere power available to do so if we can not stop warfare in we own economic system how can we expect to abolish it internationally one kind of proprietorship these proposal would go far toward create the economic atmosphere favore growth of the individual who in turn would help we to cope with runaway technology individual human strength be need to pit against an inhuman condition the battle be not easy we be tempt to blame other for we problem rather than look they straight in the face and realize they be of we own make and possible of solution only by ourselves with the help of desperately need enlighten competent leader person develop in today s corporation can not hope to serve here a judgment base on experience of i own in business and in activity outside in i own company in effect a partnership although legally a corporation i have be able to do many thing for i employee which normal corporation of comparable size and nature would have be unable to do also i be convince that if i company be a sole proprietorship instead of a partnership i would have be even abl to solve long-range problem for myself and i fellow-employees any ability i may have be achieve in they present shape from experience in share in the growth and control of i business couple with raise i family this combine experience on a foundation of very average i assure you intelligence and background have help i do thing many well-informed people would bet heavily against perhaps a list of some of the practice of i company will help here the company grow out of effort by two completely inexperience man in they late twenties neither have a formal education applicable to or experience in manufacture or sell we type of article from an initial investment of $ 1200 in 1943 it have grow with no additional capital investment to a present value estimate by some a exceed $ 10000000 we do nt disclose financial figure to the public it growth continue steadily on a par with past growth and no limitation be in evidence we pin-curl clip and self-locking nut achieve dominance in just a few year time despite substantial well establish competition
