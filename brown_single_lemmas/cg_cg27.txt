in recollection he have say natural or man-made object keep come into i head but i would suppress they sternly moreover he organize the movement of he form within he rigorously shape space into highly complex equilibriums and use gradation of color value a well a sharply contrast elementary color the worthy mondrian see these picture say in a tone of kindly reproof but you be really an artist of the naturalistic tradition helion do not realize it at the time but it be true he monumental abstraction make up of smooth metallic non-objects act upon each other with great tension win helion much acclaim during the thirties the play of novel light effect also enter into these composition whose control power and vary activity make they well worth meditate a helion s work show more and more nostalgia for the world of man and nature the pure abstractionist express some disapproval but leger arp lipchitz and alexander calder at the time give he they bless he canvas nowadays bear title frankly declare they to be figure in space or blue figure or pink figure and they have vaguely head and foot exhibit in show in london in 1935 and in new york the follow year the new more elaborate abstract be much favore in the circle of the modernist a three-dimentional drama of great intellectual coherence at this period the thirty-year old helion be rank a one of the mature leader of the modern movement accord to herbert read and in the direct line of descent from cezanne seurat gris and leger in america meyer schapiro observe that unlike the mondrian school helion seek a return path to the fullness of nature within the framework of abstract art it be notable that at this time he be write with admiration of cimabue s and poussin s way of fill space abstract art be still the right path for he but he hold instead of continue a an art of reduction it must grow must make a place for the contribution of the raphaels and poussin a well a for those of the early cubist and mondrian late helion write of this phase for year i build for myself a subtle instrument of relationship color and form without a name i play on it i secret song unexplained passionate and peaceful but he own work be evolve far the extreme limitation he sense in all current abstract art make that seem to he increasingly arid and cold he be engage in constant experiment that search for new direction where would it all lead he himself do not know a he say in 1935 but he be afraid of the future he would in fact welcome a way back to social integration a functional art of some kind during the 1920 s the abstractionist the german bauhaus group of industrial designer and the new architect all have the dream of some well order utopia or welfare state in which they neat and logical construction might find they proper place but whereas the postwar american abstractionist seem to helion to be determine to escape from the real world or simply to rebel against it the order abstraction which he and he associate of the 1930 s be painting embody the hope of improve thing we be possess by vision of a new civilization to come very pure and elevate he have say in fact some ideal form of socialism such a we have dream of since the war of 1914-1918 instead of this the 1930 s witness a tragic economic depression the rise of fascist dictator in europe the waste civil war in spain very much the political man helion feel himself deeply affect by the increasingly pessimistic atmosphere of france and all europe whose foundation seem to he more and more shaky in 1936 he decide to migrate to america the rooseveltian america be a haven of liberalism and progress and seem to he to constitute the last good hope for civilization helion also hope that america s mastery of technology and industrial efficiency would be accompany by the production of new and beautiful art work i arrive in the unite state with the idea of establish myself there more or less permanently and find inspiration for new composition in new york he be well receive by what be then only a small brave band of non-figurative artist include alexander calder george kl morris de koon holty and a few other after a year in a studio on sheridan square have marry an american girl who be a native of virginia helion move to a village in the blue ridge mountain where he produce some of the most impose of he abstract canvas the darken world scene at the time of the munich pact continue to trouble he mind even in he remote virginia studio fear possess i and the certainty of war he have relate i truly smell blood death heap of corpse everywhere in haste he labored to finish some last abstract painting a three-panel frieze with a fly figure and a fall figure a double-figure which go to the chicago art institute and be consider by he the most successful of he abstract and in early 1939 a fall figure of very ominous character which conclude he abstract phase i know i be carry on with abstraction to it very end for i he say of the two year output in virginia with those painting of big construction crash down he feel he could stop they be in effect he last testament to non-objective art he have take out first paper for american citizenship but after war come to europe he decide to return to france arrive there in january 1940 i hate the war he say but think i ought to go because i be perhaps one of those who have nt do enough to prevent it in june 1940 sergeant helion with a company of reserve troop wait to go into battle be sketch the hill south of the loire river when the war suddenly roll in upon he it first apparition be a long gloomy column of refugee ride in farm wagon or push pram he company then carry out a confuse retreat movement until it be surround by the german a few day before france capitulate after a sort of death march during four day without food helion and he comrade be ship by cattle-car to a labor camp at an estate farm in east germany a year late they be remove to a stalag in the harbor of stettin at the time of he capture helion have on he person a sketchbook he have buy at woolworth s in new york when he be strip deloused and number by he guard he much-thumbed sketchbook be seize and throw on a pile of prisoner goods to be confiscate it be then i know that they be make war against man the individual within who question thing when give order at stettin the university-educated artist who have study german be choose to serve a interpreter and clerk in the office of the stalag commander in secret he also act a a member of the prisoner central committee which plot sabotage plan a few escape and maintain a hide control over the wretched french slave-laborers in the stalag helion come to know and love he comrade most of they plain folk who in they extremity show true courage and run great risk to help each other how much they esteem he be show by the fact that they underground committee select he a one of the few who would be help to escape in the prison camp s black market civilian clothe be quietly buy and forge paper be devise for he during long week the plan for he flight be rehearse every morning contingent of prisoner would be send out to labor in nearby factory one even while a volley-ball game be be play in the yard among the prisoner remain there a simulate melee be stage just a the gate be open to admit other prisoner return from work a helion write afterward they sentry follow four hand be stretch toward i by i comrade behind i marquet hold i briefcase finot hold a wallet with i money and paper moineau and david hold

secret guide he eventually reach vichy france and by the winter of 1943 be back in virginia he write to escape from a prison camp require a very special state of mind not only loathing of captivity but a faith a hope that be even strong i leave behind i brave man whom captivity have rob of all hope they too love they family long for they village yet lack the faith that drive one to dare the fearful chance of escape it be a time of revelation for he even the most rational of man under great stress may be transport by a new faith and behave like mystic helion know that he owe he freedom a much to the self-sacrifice of he fellow-man in arbeitskommando 13 stettin a to he own fierce will and love of life after that he declare to return to freedom be to fall to one s knee before the real world and adore it in prison he have be able to sketch nothing but figure from life he guard he companion in misery now all he desire center on rediscover and sing of the prosaic and yet beautiful world of man and object so long bar from i by a barbed wire fence and he add during the many month in prison camp all abstract image vanish from i mind before leave for america he happen to see he old friend jeans arp and confide to he he new resolution arp protest but it be impossible everything in the way of representation have already be do by the old master helion however cling to the belief that in escape from the stalag i have also escape from abstraction while convalesce in he virginia home he write a book record he prison experience and escape entitle they shall not have i publish originally in helion s english by dutton & co of new york in 1943 the book be receive by the press a a work of astonish literary power and one of the most realistic account of world war 2 from the french side it be very widely read too and the author who seem the embodiment of france s rise spirit of resistance to she conqueror be much compliment for he dare military action but when he show he new figurative picture to he artist friend of the abstract camp they pay he no compliment and draw long face between 1944 and 1947 helion have a series of one-man show at the paul rosenberg gallery in
