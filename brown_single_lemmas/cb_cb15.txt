the providence journal editorial jan 25 entitle east greenwich face a house development problem point to a dilemma that face community such a ours you suggest solution it seem to i be grossly oversimplify and be inconsistent with you generally realistic attitude toward and endorsement of sound plan first of all there be ample area in east greenwich already zon in the classification similar to that which petitioner request this land be in various stage of development in several location throughout the town the demand for these lot can be meet for some time to come this would seem to indicate that we be try neither to halt an influx of migrant nor be we set up such standard for development that only the well-to-do could afford to buy land and build in the new site what we be attempt to do be achieve and maintain a balance between medium density and low density residential area and industrial and commercial development it be in fact entirely consistent with you suggestion of modest industrial development to help pay governmental cost bostitch inc be approximately half way through a 10-year exemption of they real estate tax the wisdom of grant such tax exemption be another matter but this particular instance be in i opinion completely satisfactory the 1960 tax book for east greenwich indicate a valuation for this property in excess of two million dollar with we current $ 3 per hundred tax rate it be safe to assume that this will qualify when you suggest a community should try to develop a modest industrial plant a the good way to meet these problem in order to attract additional industry that be compatible with this community it be all the more important to present to the industrial prospect an orderly balance in the tax structure a this tax base grow so then can you medium and low density residential area grow mr richard preston executive director of the new hampshire state plan and development commission in he remark to the governor conference on industrial development at providence on october 8 1960 warn against the fallacy of attempt to attract industry solely to reduce the tax rate or to underwrite municipal service such a school when he say if this be the fundamental reason for a community s interest or if this be the basic approach success if any will be difficult to obtain he go on to say in the first place industry per se be not dedicate to the role of savior of founder municipality it be not in business for the purpose of absorb increase municipal cost no matter how high a purpose that may be while councilman olson cite the anticipate increase in school cost in answer to a direct question from a taxpayer the impact upon a school system do not have to be measure only in increase tax to find alarm in uncontrolled growth we in east greenwich have the example of two neighboring community one currently utilize double session in they school and the other face this prospect next year it have already be report in you newspaper that the east greenwich school committee be consider addition to at least one elementary school and to the high school to insure future accommodation for a school population that we know will increase if they be to be commend for foresight in they plan what then be the judgment of a town council that compound this problem during the plan stage where then be the sound plan and cooperation between agency within the community that you have call for in other editorial i submit that it can not be dismiss simply by say we be not face the fact of life the fruitful course of metropolitanization that you recommend be currently practice by the town of east greenwich and have it inception long before we learn what it be call for example 1 the east greenwich police department utilize the radio transmission facility of the warwick police department thereby eliminate duplication of facility and ensure police coordination in the cowessett-east greenwich-potowomut area of the two community 2 the east greenwich fire district service part of warwick a well a east greenwich 3 the taxpayer of east greenwich appropriate sum of money a do other kent county community for the support of the kent county memorial hospital a regional facility 4 the east greenwich free library receive financial support from the town of east greenwich and the city of warwick to supplement it endowment 5 feeler be put out last year to the city of warwick a report in you newspaper suggest investigation of a common rubbish disposal area to service the potowomut and cowessett area of warwick along with east greenwich 6 east greenwich be one of the first rhode island town to enter into contract agreement with the rhode island development council for plan service we could not provide for ourselves 7 the education program for retard child conduct by the east greenwich school system have pupil from at least one neighboring community i feel compel to write this because i be greatly concern with the problem of community growth rate and the relation between type of growth in a town such a east greenwich i believe it be an area in which professional planner have fail to set adequate guide post and yet they can not ignore this problem because it concern the implementation of nearly all the plan program they have devise these program be volume of waste paper and lose hour if the citizen of a community must stand aside while land developer tell they when where and in what manner the community shall grow we have far less to fear in the migrant family than we have in the migrant developer under these condition until professional planner meet this situation squarely and update the concept of zoning in a manner acceptable to the court i hope we in east greenwich can continue to shape we own destiny i would like very much on behalf of i husband and myself to send we eternal thank to all the wonderful people responsible for the gabrielle fund it be indeed true a

the fine work they do in all kind of weather have they not get i to the hospital when they do perhaps i would not be here to commend they at this time many thank for a job well do the providence sunday journal article jan 29 ask whether american taxpayer be be victimize by a gigantic giveaway to pay for the care of war veteran who have non-service-connected disability sound a though the providence journal be desperate for news usually a veteran have to hang himself to get space on the front page on the question of admission to veteran administration hospital of service-connected and non-service-connected disable veteran it must be recognize that there be many man who be greatly affect by war service it can manifest itself before discharge from service or it can come out year late there be one other point we should never lose sight of many veteran who enter va hospital a non-service case late qualify a service-connected no psychiatrist could tell i that the experience in a war can not have it effect in the ensue year the argument advance by those individual and group who oppose the system in force and who would drastically curtail or do away entirely with hospital care for the non-service-connected case seem to be coldly impractical and out-of-step with the wish of the general public i believe in priority for service-connected disable veteran in admission to va hospital but i do nt believe we should close the door on non-service-connected patient this matter be of great importance and the outcome may mean the difference between life or death or at least serious injury for many veteran some critic say that the length of stay in a hospital be too long there s a reason for this length of stay first of all the admit physician in the va hospital get the patient a a new patient he have no experience with this veteran s previous medical record if the doctor be conscientious he want to study the patient a a result it take a little long than it would on the outside where the family physician know about the patient secondly the va physician know that when the patient leave the hospital he be no long go to have a chance to visit he patient so he keep the veteran in until he can observe the effect of treatment or surgery the american public must be present with the fact concern va hospitalization the public should understand that whether they support a state hospital or a va hospital the tax dollar have to be pay one way or the other the responsibility be still go to be there whether they pay for a va hospital or the tax dollar be spend for the state hospital an adequate system of va hospital be good equip to care for the veteran than any 50 state hospital it seem that open season upon veteran hospitalization be once more upon we the american medical association be once again grind out it tear-soaked propaganda base upon the high cost of the veteran administration medical program to the american taxpayer do they the ama offer any solution other than outright abolition of a medical system unsurpassed anywhere in the world we veteran acknowledge the fact that a time pass the demand for medical care at va hospital will grow proportionately a age foster illness nevertheless we wonder at the stand of the ama on the health problem confront the age they oppose the forand bill which would have place the major burden of financial support upon the individual himself through compulsory payroll deduction yet they support the eisenhower administration which will cost a small state like ours approximately five million dollar match incidentally by a federal grant to initiate
