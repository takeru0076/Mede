germanium have show that these glass be probably produce from terrestrial or less likely from lunar matter by impact of a celestial body the gallium germanium ratio be high than that for ordinary igneous metamorphic or sedimentary matter a a result of selective volatilization of the component of the tektite gallium oxide be less volatile than silica the main constituent of tektites and germanium oxide be more volatile australites tektites from australia give the appearance of a second melt in conformity with this conclusion a high trace gallium content be find in the portion flange

libyan desert silica-glass another natural glass be compose of nearly pure silica and have the same trace germanium content a sand in the area the gallium content however have be enhance five-fold this glass be probably form from libyan desert sand by comet or stony-meteorite impact nickel-iron meteorite with sufficient kinetic energy to produce large terrestrial explosion crater may nevertheless melt only small quantity of material most of the impact energy be spend in crush and fragmentation when rapid quench follow melt impact glass may result these always contain metallic
