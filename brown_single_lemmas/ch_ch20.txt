wildlife habitat resource in 1960 one-quarter of the 925 million recreation visit to the national forest and grassland be for the primary purpose of hunt and fish hunter and fisherman visit since 1949 have increase 8 time fast than the nationwide sale of hunt and fish license this use be expect to increase to about 50 million visit by 1972 the long-range objective of habitat management be to make it fully productive so a to support fish and game population to contribute to the need for public use and enjoyment the wildlife habitat management proposal for the 10-year period be 1 revise and complete wildlife habitat management and improvement plan for all administrative unit assure proper coordination between wildlife habitat management and other resource 2 inventory and evaluate wildlife habitat resource in cooperation with other federal agency and with the state in which national forest and grassland be locate a a basis for orderly development of wildlife habitat improvement and coordination program include a big-game gamebird and small-game habitat survey and investigation on the 186 million acre of national forest and grassland b fishery habitat survey and investigation on the 81000 mile of national forest fish stream and nearly 3 million acre of lake and impoundment and c participation in plan inspection and control phase of all habitat improvement land and water use project conduct on national forest land by state other federal agency and private group to assure that project will benefit wildlife and be in harmony with other resource value 3 improve food and cover on 15 million acre of key wildlife area 4 develop wildlife opening food patch and game way in dense vegetation by clear or control burn on 400000 acre 5 improve 7000 mile of fish stream and 56000 acre of lake by stabilize bank plant streamside cover and construct channel improvement protection the total adverse impact of disease insect fire weather destructive animal and other force on the use and value of forest resource be not generally recognize they kill and destroy retard or prevent reproduction and growth impair and damage value and disrupt use the loss in growth of sawtimber because of damage by destructive agency in the unite state in 1952 be estimate to be about 44 billion board foot if it be not for the effect of destructive agency sawtimber growth would have be nearly twice a great a the 47 billion board foot in 1952 about 45 percent of the loss in growth be attributable to disease 20 percent to insect 17 percent to fire and 18 percent to weather animal and various other cause these destructive force also have a seriously adverse effect upon the watershed and they life-supporting waterflows and upon the other renewable forest resource the long-range objective be to hold the damage from destructive agency below the level which would seriously interfere with intensive management of the national forest system under principle of multiple use and high-level sustain yield of product and service this can be accomplish substantially by a continue trend toward good facility and technique for fire control and more resource to cope with critical fire period and a more intensive application of a program of prevention detection and control of insect and disease infestation in addition to direct protection measure more intensive management of timber resource will assist in reduction of loss from insect and disease protection from insect and disease in the 10-year period it be propose that insect and disease control on the national forest system be step up to a level of prevention detection and control of insect and disease infestation that will substantially reduce the occurrence of large infestation toward the end of the initial period this will require about a 40 percent increase over the present level of protection the work will consist of 1 intensification of present activity through a quick more extensive and more thorough survey to detect incipient outbreak b more reliable evaluation of the potential of initial outbreak to cause widespread damage c quick and more effective control action in the initial stage to prevent a large-scale epidemic the initial suppression activity would cover about twice the acreage currently be treat 2 continuation of present blister rust control work plus extension of control to 250000 acre not now protect but which should be manage for white pine production the objective be to achieve sufficient effectiveness of control on all of the area now under treatment plus the additional acre so that after the initial period only maintenance control will be need 3 initiate a program to control dwarf mistletoe on several hundred thousand acre of select good stand of young softwood sawtimber on good grow site 4 coordination of pest control objective with timber management activity to reduce loss protection from fire it be propose that in 10 year all commercial timberland all critical watershed and other land in the national forest system develop or propose for intensive use will be give protection from fire adequate to meet the fire situation in the bad year and under serious peak load this will include 125 million acre compare with 23 million acre now receive such protection an additional 15 million acre will be give a lesser degree of protection but adequate to meet the average fire situation meet these level of protection from fire call for 1 expansion modernization and development of fire control to a proficiency and strength of force which will prevent a many fire a possible and suppress fire before they spread beyond permit standard this be to be accomplish by nearly double the present level of preventive effort detection skilled fire-fighting crew and equipment use this will include a stepped-up program of train and development of personnel 2 adoption and use of new and modern technique be develop for prevention for suppression of fire while small and for stop large fire while run and burn intensely 3 reduction of hazardous fuel condition to minimize the chance of large fire develop and spread to high-value area this work will cover the most serious one-fourth of all land need such treatment and will consist of burn 250000 acre of highly hazardous debris concentration fell snag on 350000 acre of high lightning-occurrence area prescribe burn on 35 million acre remove roadside fuel on 39000 acre and clear and maintain 11000 mile of firebreak protection from other damage rodent control work for the 10-year period will be aim at control of the most serious infestation of harmful rodent such a porcupine and mouse on high-value area of forage and commercial timberland these area comprise about half of the total area of rodent infestation on the national forest approximately 18 million acre of rangeland and 94 million acre of timberland would be treat in this period control would be limit to those rodent for which economical mean of control be know road and trail the transportation system which serve the national forest be a complex of highway and access road and trail under various ownership and jurisdiction this system be divide into a forest highway system administer by the secretary of commerce and a forest development road and trail system administer by the secretary of agriculture both of these system be essential for the production development and use of the national forest in the forest highway system there be now 24400 mile of public road these be mostly through highway that carry traffic go from one destination to another because administration of the forest highway system be a responsibility of the secretary of commerce with maintenance provide by the state and county this development program for the national forest do not include estimate of the fund need to maintain the forest highway system nor to construct the addition to it that be need it be estimate that about 70000 mile of forest highway will eventually be need to fully serve the national forest in the forest development road and trail system there be now 162400 mile of road and 106500 mile of supplemental foot and horse trail these road be largely of less than highway standard and usually carry traffic which be relate to use of the national forest construction and maintenance of this system be a responsibility of the secretary of agriculture it be estimate that about 542250 mile of forest development road and 80000 mile of trail constitute the system that will eventually be need to obtain the maximum practicable yield and use of the wood water forage and wildlife and recreation resource of the national forest on a continue basis the ultimate trail system will be of value primarily for recreation and wildlife utilization and fire protection it will be carefully plan to maintain optimum service to these important resource and watershed the presence or lack of access by road or trail have a direct and control influence on all phase of forest management and utilization such a a the protection of forage timber and wildlife resource from fire insect and disease b the balance use of recreation hunt and fish area c the volume of timber that can be market especially for small sales and the support of dependent community and small business enterprise d the level of salvage cut in dead and die timber stand and the opportunity to promptly salvage loss result from fire windstorm insect and disease e the protection of watershed land from erosion and overgraze by animal the existence of road system permit an intensity of management and use for all national forest purpose that be not otherwise possible furthermore road that give access to national forest timber be investment which pay they own way over a period of year use of these road by the public result in substantial benefit to the locality the road serve the long-range objective of this department be to provide and maintain a system of forest development road and trail which will adequately service the national forest system at the level need to meet expect need and optimum production of product and service for the year 2000 this mean service a the protection requirement of a watershed produce at least 200 million acre-feet of water each year b recreation and wildlife resource use each year by 635 million visitor c a timber resource support an annual cut of 21 billion board foot and d 60 million acre of rangeland service at these level of production and utilization will eventually require the construction of about 379900 mile of new road and 6000 mile of new trail along with the reconstruction to high standard of about 105000 mile of road and 10500 mile of trail about 26500 mile of exist trail will be replace in service by the construction of new road about 80 percent of these long-range requirement should be meet by the year 2000 program proposal for forest development road and trail for the 10-year period 1963-1972 be a follow 1 complete the construction and reconstruction of about 79400 mile of multiple-purpose road and 8000 mile of trail this constitute about 17 percent of the long-range requirement for these facility approximately 40 percent of the value of the work on road for access to timber which be plan for this period will be construct by purchaser of national forest timber but pay for by the government through adjustment of stumpage price 2 provide maintenance to full standard on the 268900 mile of exist access road and trail and on the new road and trail construct during the period land adjustment land purchase land use within the unit in the national forest system the pattern of land ownership be quite irregular in some unit national forest ownership be well block together in many other the previous patent of land under the public land law or the way in which land be available for purchase result in a scatter pattern of ownership within exterior boundary of national forest and national grassland there be about 40000000 acre in non-federal ownership one consequence be the occurrence of occasional conflict because private owner of some inholdings object to public program of use on neighboring national forest or other federal land or because such ownership be develop for use that be not compatible with use for the public of neighboring national forest land some privately hold inholdings be a source of direct damage to these federal land and some which be suitable for tree grow and for other national forest purpose be unmanaged or in need of expensive rehabilitation and be contribute nothing to the economy there be no reasonable prospect that these condition will be correct or change land in this last category be situate largely in the mountainous portion of the eastern state the long-range objective be to bring about consolidation of ownership through use of land exchange authority and through purchase on a moderate scale of inholdings which comprise key tract for recognize national forest program such a recreation development or which be a source of damage to land in national forest and national grassland
