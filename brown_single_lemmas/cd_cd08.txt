but again we have no real evidence on this from that quarter until the close of the ninth century ad when an arabic scholar tabit ibn korra 836-901 be say to have discuss the magic square of three thus while it remain possible that the babylonian and the pythagorean may perhaps have have the magic square of three before the chinese do more definite evidence will have to turn up from the middle east or the classical world before china can lose she claim to the early know magic square by more than a thousand year 2 the lo shu square a an expression of centrality the concept of the middle kingdom at peace strong and unite under a forceful ruler which have be only a longed-for ideal in the time of the war state be finally realize by the establishment of a chinese empire under the chin dynasty 221-207 bc but this be only accomplish by excessive cruelty and extreme of totalitarian despotism among the many severe measure take by the first emperor shih huang-ti in he effort to insure the continuation of this hard-won national unity be the burn of the book in 213 bc with the express intention of remove possible source for divergent think but a he have a special fondness for magic and divination he order that book on these subject should be spare many of the latter be destroy in they turn during the burn of the vast chin palace some ten year late yet some must have survive because the old interest in number symbolism divination and magic persist on into the han dynasty which succeed in reuniting china and keep it together for a long period from 202 bc to ad 220 in fact during the first century bc an extensive literature spring up devote to these subject find it typical expression in the so-called wei book a number of which be specifically devote to the lo shu and relate numerical diagram especially in connection with divination however the wei book be also destroy in a series of orthodox confucian purge which culminate in a final proscription in 605 after all this destruction of old literature it should be obvious why we have so little information about the early history and development of the lo shu which be already semisecret anyhow but in spite of all this enough evidence remain to show that the magic square of three must indeed have be the object of a rather extensive cult or series of cult reach full expression in the han period although modern scholar have express surprise that the simple magic square of three a mere mathematical puzzle be able to exert a considerable influence on the mind and imagination of the culture chinese for so many century they could have find most of the answer right within the square itself but up to now no one have attempt to analyze it inherent mathematical property or the numerical significance of it number singly or in combination and then try to consider these in the light of old chinese cosmological concept such an analysis speedily reveal why the middle number of the lo shu 5 be so vitally significant for the chinese ever since the early hint that they have a knowledge of this diagram the importance of this 5 can largely be explain by the natural mathematical property of the middle number and it special relationship to all the rest of the number quite apart from any numerological consideration which be to say any symbolic mean arbitrarily assign to it indeed mathematically speak it be both functionally and symbolically the most important number in the entire diagram if one take the middle number 5 and multiply it by 3 the base number of the magic square of three the result be 15 which be also the constant sum of all the row column and two main diagonal then if the middle number be activate to it great potential in term of this square through multiply it by the high number 9 which be the square of the base number the result be 45 and the latter be the total sum of all the number in the square by which all the other number be overshadow and in which they may be say to be absorb furthermore the middle number of the lo shu be not only the physical mean between every oppose pair of the other number by reason of it central position it be also they mathematical mean since it be equal to half the sum of every oppose pair all of which equal 10 in fact the neat balance of these pair and they subtle equilibrium would have have special mean in the mind of the old chinese for they consider the odd number a male and the even one a female equate the two group with the yang and yin principle in nature and in this square the respective pair make up of large and small odd yang number and those compose of large and small even yin number be all equal to each other thus all difference be leveled and all contrast erase in a realm of no distinction and the harmonious balance of the lo shu square could effectively symbolize the world in balance harmony around a powerful central axis the tremendous emphasis on the 5 in the lo shu square for purely mathematical reason and the fact that this number so neatly symbolize the heart and center of the universe could well explain why the old chinese seem to have so rever the number 5 and why they put so much stress on the concept of centrality these twin tendency seem to have reach they height in the han dynasty the exist reverence for centrality must have be still far stimulate toward the close of the second century bc when the han emperor wu ti order the dynastic color change to yellow which symbolize the center among the traditional five direction and take 5 a the dynastic number believe that he would thus place himself he imperial family and the nation under the most auspicious influence he immediate motive for do this may not have be directly inspire by the lo shu but this measure must inevitably have increase the exist belief in the latter s efficacy after this time inscription on the han bronze mirror a well a other writing emphasize the desirability of keep one s self at the center of the universe where cosmic force be strong late we shall see what happen when an emperor take this idea too literally all this emphasis on centrality and on the number 5 a a symbolic expression of the center which seem to have begin a far back a 400 bc also may conceivably have lead to the development of the five-elements school and the subsequent effort to fit everything into numerical category of five we find for example such grouping a the five ancient ruler the five sacred mountain the five direction with center the five metal five color five taste five odor five musical note five bodily function five viscera and many other this trend have often be ascribe to the cult of the five element itself a though they have serve a the base for all the rest but why do the old chinese postulate five element when the ancient near east which may have initiate the idea that natural element exert influence in human life and activity recognize only four and why do the chinese suddenly begin to talk about the five direction when the animal they use a symbol of the direction designate only the usual four obviously something suddenly cause they to start think in term of fives and that may have be the working of the lo shu this whole tendency have an unfortunate effect on chinese think whereas the primary meaning of the lo shu diagram seem to have be base on it inner mathematical property and we shall see that even it secondary meaning rest on some mathematical base the urgent desire to place everything into category of fives lead to other grouping base on other number until an exaggerate emphasis on mere numerology pervade chinese think scholar make number set of a many thing a possible in nature or assign arbitrary number to individual thing in a fashion that seem to the modern scientific mind a downright nonsensical and philosophical idea base upon all this tend to stifle speculative think in china for many century 3 yin and yang in the lo shu square although the primary mathematical property of the middle number at the center of the lo shu and the interrelation of all the other number to it might seem enough to account for the deep fascination which the lo shu hold for the old chinese philosopher this be actually only a begin of wonder for the lo shu square be a remarkably complete compendium of most of the chief religious and philosophical idea of it time a such one can not fully understand the think of the pre-han and han period without know the meaning inherent in the lo shu but conversely one can not begin to understand the lo shu without know something about the world view of the old chinese which they feel they see express in it the chinese world view during the han dynasty when the lo shu seem to have be at the height of it popularity be base in large part on the teaching of the yin-yang and five-elements school which be traditionally found by tsou yen accord to this doctrine the universe be rule by heaven tien a a natural force or in the personification of a supreme sky-god govern all thing by mean of a process call the tao which can be roughly interpret a the order of the universe or the universal way heaven act through the tao express itself by mean of the working of two basic principle the yin and the yang the yang or male principle be the source of light heat and dynamic vitality associate with the sun while the yin or female principle flourish in darkness cold and quiet inactivity and be associate with the moon together these two principle influence all thing and in vary combination they be present in everything we have already see that odd number be consider a be yang while the even number be yin so that the eight outer number of the lo shu represent these two principle in balance equilibrium around the axial center during the han dynasty another yin-yang conception be apply to the lo shu consider the latter a a plan of ancient china instead of link the nine number of this diagram with the traditional nine province a be usually do this equate the odd yang number with mountain firm and resistant hence yang and the even number with river sinuous and yield hence yin take the former from the five sacred mountain of the han period and the latter from the principal river system of old china thus the middle number 5 represent sung-shan in honan central china the 3 tai-shan in shantung east china the 7 hwa-shan in shensi west china the 1 heng-shan in hopei north china or the mountain with the same name in neighboring shansi and the 9 huo-shan in anhwei which be then the south sacred mountain for the river the 4 represent the huai to the then southeast the 2 the san kiang three river in the then southwest the 8 the chi in the northeast and the 6 the upper yellow river in the northwest note that by western standard this plan be upside down a it put north at the bottom and south at the top with the other direction correspondingly alter but in this respect it be merely follow the accept chinese convention for all map the same arrangement be use when the lo shu be equate with the nine province and whenever the lo shu involve directional symbolism it be orient in this same fashion
