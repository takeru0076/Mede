two facet of this aspect of the literary process have special significance for we time one a reservation on the point i have just make be the phenomenon of pseudo-thinking pseudo-feeling and pseudo-willing which fromm discuss in the escape from freedom in essence this involve ground one s think and emotion in the value and experience of other rather than in one s own value and experience there be a risk that instead of teach a person how to be himself read fiction and drama may teach he how to be somebody else clearly what the person bring to the read be important moreover if the critic instruct he audience in what to see in a work he be contribute to this pseudo-thinking if he instruct they in how to evaluate a work he be help they to achieve they own identity the second timely part of this sketch of literature and the search for identity have to do with the difference between good and endure literary work and the ephemeral mass culture product of today in the range and variety of character who in they literary life get along all right with life style one never imagine possible there be an implicit lesson in differentiation the reader observe this process might ask why not be different and find in the answer a license to be a variant of the human species the observer of television or other product for a mass audience have only a permit to be like the model he see even more like everybody else and this i think hold for value a well a life style one would need to test this proposition carefully after all the large and probably unreliable reader s digest literature on the most unforgettable character i ever meet deal with village grocer country doctor favorite if illiterate aunt and so forth scientist often turn out to be idiosyncratic too but still the proposition be worth examination it be possible that the study of literature affect the conscience the morality the sensitivity to some code of right and wrong i do not know that this be true both flugel and ranyard west deal with the development and nature of conscience a do such theologian a niebuhr and buber it form the core of many perhaps most problem of psychotherapy i be not aware of great attention by any of these author or by the psychotherapeutic profession to the role of literary study in the development of conscience most of they attention be to a pre-literate period of life or for the theologian of course to the influence of religion still it would be surprise if what one read do not contribute to one s idea of right and wrong certainly the awaken alarm over the comic book and the continuous concern over prurient literature indicate some peripheral aspect of this influence probably the most important thing to focus on be not the development of conscience which may well be almost beyond the reach of literature but the content of conscience the code which be impart to the develop or immature conscience available this be in large part a code of behavior and a glossary of value what be it that people do and should do and how one should regard it in a small way this be illustrate by the nineteenth-century novelist who argue for the powerful influence of literature a a teacher of society and who illustrate this with the way a girl learn to meet she lover how to behave how to think about this new experience how to exercise restraint literature may be say to give people a sense of purpose dedication mission significance this no doubt be part of what gilbert selde imply when he say of the art they give form and mean to life which might otherwise seem shapeless and without sense man seem almost universally to want a sense of function that be a feel that they existence make a difference to someone live or unborn close and immediate or generalize feel useless seem generally to be an unpleasant sensation a need so deeply plant ask for direction so to speak be likely to be gratify by the vivid example and heroic proportion of literature the term renewal and refresh which often come up in aesthetic discussion seem partly to derive they import from the renewal of purpose and a refresh sense of significance a person may receive from poetry drama and fiction the notion of inspiration be somehow cognate to this feel how literature do this or for whom be certainly not clear but the content form and language of the message a well a the source would all play differentiate part in give and molding a sense of purpose one of the most salient feature of literary value have be deem to be it influence upon and organization of emotion let we differentiate a few of these idea the aristotelian notion of catharsis the purge of emotion be a persistent and viable one the idea here be one of discharge but this must stand in opposition to a second view plato s notion of the arousal of emotion a third idea be that artistic literature serve to reduce emotional conflict give a sense of serenity and calm to individual this be give some expression in beardsley s notion of harmony and the resolution of indecision a fourth view be the transformation of emotion a in housman s fine phrase on the art they transform and beautify we inner nature it be possible that the idea of enrichment of emotion be a fifth idea fsc northrop in he discussion of the function and future of poetry suggest this one of the thing which make we life drab and empty and which leave we at the end of the day fatigue and deflate spiritually be the pressure of the tax practical utilitarian concern of common-sense object if art be to release we from these postulate thing thing we must think symbolically about and bring we back to the ineffable beauty and richness of the aesthetic component of reality in it immediacy it must sever it connection with these common sense entity i take the central mean here to be the contrast between the drab empty quality of life without literature and a life enrich by it richards view of the aesthetic experience might constitute a sixth variety for he it constitute in part the organization of impulse a sketch of the emotional value of the study of literature would have to take account of all of these but there be one in particular which it seem to i deserve special attention in the wide range of experience common to we earth-bound race none be more difficult to manage more troublesome and more endure in it effect than the control of love and hate the study of literature contribute to this control in a curious way william wimsatt and cleanth brook it seem to i have a penetrate insight into the way in which this control be effect for if we say poetry be to talk of beauty and love and yet not aim at exciting erotic emotion or even an emotion of platonic esteem and if it be to talk of anger and murder and yet not aim at arouse anger and indignation then it may be that the poetic way of deal with these emotion will not be any kind of intensification compound or magnification or any direct assault upon the affection at all something indirect mix reconcile tensional might well be the stratagem the devious technique by which a poet indulge in all kind of talk about love and anger and even in something like expression of these emotion without aim at they incitement or even utter anything that essentially involve they incitement the rehearsal through literature of emotional life under control condition may be a most valuable human experience here i do not mean catharsis the discharge of emotion i mean something more like freud s concept of the utility of play to a small child he play house or doctor or fireman a a way of master slightly frighten experience relive they imaginatively until they be under control there be a second feature of the influence of literature good literature on emotional life which may have some special value for we time in bm spinley s portrayal of the underprivileged and undereducated youth of london a salient find be the inability to postpone gratification a need to satisfy impulse immediately without the pleasure of anticipation or of savoring the experience perhaps it be only an analogy but one of the most obvious difference between cheap fiction and fiction of an endure quality be the development of a theme or story with leisure and anticipation anyone who have watch child develop a taste for literature will understand what i mean it be at least possible that the capacity to postpone gratification be develop a well a express in a continuous and guide exposure to great literature in any inquiry into the way in which great literature affect the emotion particularly with respect to the sense of harmony or relief of tension or sense of a transform inner nature which may occur a most careful exploration of the particular feature of the experience which produce the effect would be require in the calm which follow the read of a poem for example be the effect produce by the enforce quiet by the musical quality of word and rhythm by the sentiment or sense of the poem by the association with early reading if it be familiar by the boost to the self-esteem for the semi-literate by the diversion of attention by the sense of security in a legitimize withdrawal by a kind license for some variety of fantasy life regard a forbid or by half-conscious idea about the magical power of word these be if the research be do with subtlety and skill researchable topic but the research be miss one of the most frequent view of the value of literature be the education of sensibility that it be think to provide sensibility be a vague word cover an area of mean rather than any precise talent quality or skill among other thing it mean perception discrimination sensitivity to subtle difference both the extent to which this be true and the limit of the field of perceptual skill involve should be acknowledge it truth be illustrate by the skill sensitivity and general expertise of the english professor with whom one attend the theatre the limit be suggest by an imaginary experiment contrast the perceptual skill of english professor with that of they colleague in discriminate among motor car political candidate or female beauty along these line the particular point that sensitivity in literature lead to sensitivity in human relation would require more proof than i have see in a symposium and general exploration of the field of personal perception and interpersonal behavior the discussion do not touch upon this aspect of the subject with one possible exception solomon asch show the transcultural stability of metaphor base on sensation hot sweet bitter etc deal with personal quality of human being and event but to go from here to the belief that those more sensitive to metaphor and language will also be more sensitive to personal difference be too great an inferential leap i would say too that the study of literature tend to give a person what i shall call depth i use this term to mean three thing a search for the human significance of an event or state of affair a tendency to look at whole rather than part and a tendency to respond to these event and whole with feel it be the obverse of triviality shallowness emotional anaesthesia i think these attribute cluster but i have no evidence in fact i can only say this seem to i to follow from a wide continuous and properly guide exposure to literary art
