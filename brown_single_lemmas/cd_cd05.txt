furthermore a an encouragement to revisionist think it manifestly be fair to admit that any fraternity have a constitutional right to refuse to accept person it dislike the unitarian clergy be an exclusive club of cultivate gentleman a the term be then understand in the back bay and parker be definitely not a gentleman either in theology or in manner ezra stile gannett an honorable representative of the sanhedrin address himself frankly to the issue in 1845 insist that parker should not be persecute or calumniated and that in this republic no power to restrain he by force could exist even so gannett judiciously argue the association could legitimately decide that parker should not be encourage nor assist in diffuse he opinion by those who differ from he in regard to they correctness we today be not entitle to excoriate honest man who believe parker to be downright pernicious and who bar they pulpit against he demand to poison the mind of they congregation one can even argue though this be a delicate matter that every justification exist for they return the public lecture to the first church and so to suppress it rather than let parker use it a a sound board for he propaganda when he turn should come to occupy it finally it do seem clear a day to these clergyman a gannett s son explain in the biography of he father they have always contend for the propriety of they claim to the title of christian they demand against the calvinist orthodoxy for intellectual liberty have never mean that they would follow free inquiry to the extreme of proclaim christianity a natural religion grant all this still when modern unitarianism and the harvard divinity school recall with humorous affection the insult parker lavish upon they or else argue that after all parker receive the treatment he invite they betray an uneasy conscience whenever new england liberalism be remind of the dramatic confrontation of parker and the fraternity on january 23 1843 while it may defend the privilege of chandler robbins to demand that parker leave the association while it may plead that dr nl frothingham have every warrant for state the difference between trinitarians and unitarian be a difference in christianity the difference between mr parker and the association be a difference between no christianity and christianity despite these suppose conclusive assurance the modern liberal heave repeatedly a sigh of relief of positive thanksgiving that the association never quite bring itself officially to expel parker have it do so the blot on it escutcheon would have remain indelible nor could the harvard divinity school assemble today to honor parker s insurgence other than by get down on it collective knee and cry peccavi happily for posterity then the boston association do not actually command parker to leave the room though it come too close for comfort to what would have be an unforgivable brutality fortunately the honor of the denomination can attest that cyrus bartol defend parker s sincerity a do also gannett and chandler robbins whereupon parker break down into convulsion of weep and rush out of the room though not out of the fellowship in the hall after adjournment dr frothingham take he warmly by the hand and request parker to visit he whereupon we burly theodore again burst into tear all this near tragedy which to we border on comedy enable we to tell the story over and over again always warm ourselves with a glow of complacency it be indeed a near thing but somehow the inherent decency of new england which we inherit do triumph parker be never excommunicate to the extent that he be ostracize or even revile we solace ourselves by say he ask for it yet even after all these stratagem the conscience of christian liberality be still not lay to rest any more than be the conscience of harvard university for have do the abject penance for it rejection of ralph waldo emerson s the divinity school address of name it hall of philosophy after he in both case the stubborn fact remain liberalism give birth to two brilliant apostate both legitimate offspring of it loin and when bring to the test it behave shabbily suppose they both have venture into realm which they colleague think infidel be this the way gentleman settle frank difference of opinion be it after all possible that no matter how the liberal trumpet they confidence in human dignity they be expose to a contagion of fear more insidious than any conservative have ever to worry about however there be a crucial difference between the two history emerson evade the problem by shove it aside or rather by leave it behind he he walk out of the unitarian communion so that it could lick the wind of he departure preserve it self-respect and eventually accord he pious veneration parker insist upon not resign even when the majority want he to depart upon dare the fellowship to throw he out hence he be in he lifetime a be the memory of he afterwards a canker within the liberal sensitivity he still point an accuse finger at all of we tell we we have neither the courage to support he nor the energy to cut he throat actually the dispute between parker and the society of he time both ecclesiastical and social be a real one a bitter one it can not be smooth over by now cherish he sarcasm a delightful bit of self-deprecation or by solemnly call for a reconsideration of the justice of the objection to he the fact be incontestable that liberal world of unitarian boston be narrow-minded intellectually sterile smug afraid of the logical consequence of it own mild venture into iconoclasm and quite prepare to resort to hysterical repression when it brittle foundation be threaten parker along with garrison and charles sumner show a magnificent moral bravery when face mob mobilize in defense of the mexican war and slavery nevertheless we can find reason for respect even the bigotry of the populace they passion be genuine and the division between they and the abolitionist be clear-cut but parker a the ultra-liberal minister within the pale of a church which have proclaim itself the repository of liberality pose a different problem which be not to be resolve by hold he up a the champion of freedom even though he theological thesis have become to we commonplace the fundamental interrogation he phrase be very much with we it have be endlessly rephrase but i may here put it thus at what point do the tolerant find themselves oblige to become intolerant and then a they become aware that they have reach the end of they patience what do they to they dismay learn for the first time about themselves there can be no doubt the boston of that era could be exquisitely cruel in enforce it canon of behavior the gentle chan rever by all bostonians orthodox or unitarian write to a friend in louisville that among it many virtue boston do not abound in a tolerant spirit that the yoke of opinion crush individuality of judgment and action no city in the world be govern so little by a police and so much by mutual inspection and what be call public sentiment we stand more in awe of one another than most people opinion be less individual or run more into mass and often rule with a rod of iron even more poignantly and with the insight of a genius chan add remember this be chan not parker that should a minister in boston trust himself to he heart should he speak without book and consequently break some law of speech or be hurry into some dare hyperbole he should find little mercy chan write this in a letter i think it fair to say that he never quite reach such candor in he sermon but theodore parker commence he mission to the world-at-large disguise a the minister of a twenty-eighth congregational church which bear no resemblance to the congregational polity descend from the founder among which be still the unitarian church make explicit from the begin that the conflict between he and the hunkerish society be not something which could be evaporate into a genteel difference about clerical decorum because he speak openly with what chan have prophesy someone might with dare hyperbole parker vindicate chan s far prophecy that he who commit this infraction of taste would promptly discover how little mercy liberal be dispose to allow to libertarian who appear to they libertine an institutionalize liberalism prove itself fundamentally an institution and only within those define limit a license by remind ourselves of these factor in the situation we should i be sure come to a fresh realization however painful it be that the battle between parker and he neighbor be fight in earnest he arraign the citizen in language of so little courtesy that they have to respond with at the least resentment what otherwise could the lawyer doctor minister the man of science and letter do when tell that they have become the cherub and seraph and the three archangel who stand before the golden throne of the merchant and continually cry holy holy holy be the almighty dollar nor when we recollect how sensitive be the emotion of the old puritan stock in regard to the recent tide of immigration should we be astonish that they thin lip be compress into a white line of rage a parker snarl at they thus talk about the catholic vote a the bishop tell reproach the catholic for it you and i do the same thing there be a great many bishop who have never have a cross on they bosom nor a mitre on they head who appeal not to the authority of the pope at rome but to the almighty dollar a pope much near home boston have be control by a few capitalist lawyer and other manager who tell the editor what to say and the preacher what to think this be war parker mean business and he take repeat care to let he colleague know that he intend they even the unitarian church have catch the malaria and be bad than those who deceive they which imply that they be very bad indeed it be duty he say that he parent have give he a a rule beyond even the love that suffuse he be and the sense of humor with which he be largely supply and it be duty he would perform though it cost he acute pain and exhaust he by the age of fifty parker could weep and he weep astonishingly often and on the slight provocation but the psychology of those tear be entirely compatible with a remorseless readiness to massacre he opponent if it give i pleasure to say hard thing he write i would shut up forever we have to tell ourselves that when parker speak in this vein he believe what he say because he could continue but the truth which cost i bitter tear to say i must speak though it cost other tear hot than fire because he copiously shed he own tear and yield himself up a a live sacrifice to the impersonalized conscience of new england he be not disturb by the havoc he work in other people s conscience we endeavor to capture even a faint sense of how strenuous be the fight be muffle by we indifference to the very issue which in the boston of 1848 seem to be the central hope of it christian survival that of the literal factual historicity of the miracle a report in the four gospel it be idle to ask why we be no long disturb if somebody profess the deep piety decide anew that it be of no importance whether or not christ transform the water into wine at eleven be on the third of august ad 32 we have no answer a to why we be not alarm so we be the more prepare to give parker the credit for have take the right side in an unnecessary controversy to salute he courage and to pass on happily forget both he and the entire episode we have not the leisure or the patience or the skill to comprehend what be work in the mind and heart of a then recent graduate from the harvard divinity school who would muster the audacity to contradict he most formidable instructor the majesterial andrew norton by say that while he believe jesus like other religious teacher work miracle i see not how a miracle prove a doctrine
