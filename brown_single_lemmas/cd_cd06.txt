i have within the past fifty year come out of all uncertainty into a faith which be a dominate conviction of the truth and about which i have not a shadow of doubt it have be i lot all through life to associate with eminent scientist and at time to discuss with they the deep and most vital of all question the nature of the hope of a life beyond this i have also constantly engage in scientific work and be fully aware of the value of opinion form in science a well a in the religion in the world in an amateurish yet in a very real sense i have follow the development of archaeology geology astronomy herpetology and mycology with a hearty appreciation of the advance be make in these field at one time i become disturb in the faith in which i have grow up by the apparent inroad be make upon both old and new testament by a high criticism of the bible to refute which i feel the need of a good knowledge of hebrew and of archaeology for it seem to i that to pull out some of the prop of we faith be to weaken the entire structure doubt thus inculcate leave i flounder for a while and like some high critical friend try to continue to use the bible a the word of god while at the same time hold it to have be subject to a vast number of redactions and interpolation attempt to bridge the chasm between an old reverent bible-loving generation and a critical doubt bible-emancipated race although still aware of a great light and glow of warmth in the book i stand outside shiver in the cold in one thing the high critic like the modernist however overreach themselves in claim that the gospel of john be not write in john s time but well after the first century perhaps a late a 150 ad now if any part of the bible be assuredly the very word of god speak through he servant it be john s gospel to ask i to believe that so inexpressibly marvelous a book be write long after all the event by some admire follower and be not inspire directly by the spirit of god be ask i to accept a miracle far great than any of those record in the bible here i take i leave of i learn friend to step out on another path to which we might give the modern name of pragmatism or the thing that work test it try it and if it work accept it a a guide principle so i put i bible to the practical test of note what it say about itself and then test it to see how it work a a short possibly not the good method i look up word in the concordance and note that the bible claim from genesis 1 to revelation 22 to be god s personal message to man the next traditional step then be to accept it a the authoritative textbook of the christian faith just a one would accept a treatise on any earthly science and i submit to it condition accord to christ s invitation and promise that if any man will do he will he shall know of the doctrine whether it be of god or whether i speak of myself john 7 17 the outcome of such an experiment have be in due time the acceptance of the bible a the word of god inspire in a sense utterly different from any merely human book and with it the acceptance of we lord jesus christ a the only begotten son of god son of man by the virgin mary the saviour of the world i believe therefore that we be without exception sinner by nature alienate from god and that jesus christ the son of god come to earth the representative head of a new race to die upon the cross and pay the penalty of the sin of the world and that he who thus receive christ a he personal saviour be bear again spiritually with new privilege appetite and affection destined to live and grow in he likeness forever nor can any man save himself by good work or by a commendable moral life although such work be the natural fruit and evidence of a save faith already receive and naturally express itself through such avenue i now ever look for christ accord to he promise and those of the old testament a well to appear again in glory to put away all sin and to reign in righteousness over the whole earth to state fully what the bible mean a i daily spiritual food be a intimate and difficult a to formulate the reason for love i near and dear relative and friend the bible be a obviously and truly food for the spirit a bread be food for the body again a faith reveal god i father and christ i saviour i follow without question where he lead i daily by he spirit of love wisdom power and prayer i place he precept and he leading above every seem probability dismiss cherish conviction and hold the wisdom of man a folly when oppose to he i discern no limit to a faith vest in god and christ who be the sum of all wisdom and knowledge and dare to trust he even though call to stand alone before the world we lord s invitation with it imply promise to all be come and see i stand at the bedside of i patient one day and beheld a very sick man in terrible pain a i minister to he need i notice that he face be radiant in spite of he suffer and i learn that he be trust not only in the skill of he doctor and nurse but also the lord in he heart he have that peace of which the lord speak when he say peace i leave with you i peace i give unto you not a the world give give i unto you
