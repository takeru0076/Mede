of front life and worth fight for then harvard would have a genuine philosophic universe the good condition of it would be an open conflict and rivalry of the diverse system the world might ring with the struggle if we devote ourselves exclusively to belaboring each other the belaboring be of course jocular yet jame be not lack in fundamental seriousness unless we measure he by that ultimate seriousness of the great religious leader or thinker who stake all on he vision of god to jame this vision never quite come despite he appreciation of it in other but there be a dignity and even a hint of the inspire prophet in he word to one correspondent you ask what i be go to reply to bradley but why need one reply to everything and everybody i think that reader generally hate minute polemic and recrimination all polemic of ours should i believe be either very broad statement of contrast or fine point treat singly and a far a possible impersonally a far a the rise generation go

announcer who attempt to homogenize radio-tv commercial and the watcher of the night be a veritable wake nightmare a semi-serious literary document entitle the wing of henry jame be noteworthy if only for a keenly trenchant though little-known comment on the master s difficult late period by modest owen wister author of the virginian jame he remark in a letter to a friend be attempt the impossible namely to produce upon the reader a a painting produce upon the gazer a number of superimpose simultaneous impression he would like to put several sentence on top of each other so that you could read they all at once and get all at once the various shading and complexity equally penetrate in it fashion be the follow remark by a lady in the course of a literary conversation so much have already be write about everything that you can nt find out anything about it or the mildly epigrammatic utterance also a quotation woman s place be in the wrong who but thurber can be count on to glean such nectareous essence a tribute to midsummer bang-sashes seem terribly funny though it would be hard to explain why one of they bang the sash of the window near i bed around midnight in july and i leap out of sleep and out of bed it s just a bat say i wife reassuringly and i sigh with relief thank god for that i say i think it be a human be in a sense perhaps thurber be indebted artistically to the surrealist painter be it salvador dali who first conceive the startle fancy of a picture window in the abdomen that be it be literally a picture window you do nt see into the viscera you see a picture tree or flower this be something like what thurber s good effect be like if i be not mistake though no long able to turn out he protoplasmic pen-and-ink sketch several old favorite be scatter through the present volume thurber have retain unimpaired he vision of humor a a thing of simple unaffected humanness in he conclude paragraph he write the devote writer of humor will continue to try to come a close to truth a he can for many reader thurber come close than anyone else in sight the late low be a puzzler the master s hand have lose none of it craft he be at he usual good in expose the sham and self-deception of political and diplomatic life in the fifties the reader meet a few old friend like blimp and the tuc horse and become good acquaint with new member of the cast of character like the bomb itself and civilization in she classic robe watch the nuclear arm race she hair stand straight out but there be a difference between the present volume and the early low there be fear in the fifties a he title suggest and a he competent drawing show but there be terror in the thirties when the nazi be on the loose and in those day low strike like lightning anyone can draw he own conclusion from this difference it might be argue that the communist be less inhuman than the nazi and furnish the artist with drama in a low key but this argument can not be push very far because the communist system make up for any shortcoming of it leader in respect to corrosion the communist wield a power unknown to hitler and the lead issue that of piecemeal aggression remain the same this be drama enough do we ourselves offer mr low less of a crusade in the thirties we would not face we enemy that be a nightmarish situation and low be in he element now we have stand up to the communist we be strong and more self-confident and low can not so easily put we to right or do the reason for less jovian drawing lie elsewhere it might be that low have see too many stupidity and that they do not outrage he now he write confucius hold that in time of stress one should take short view only up to lunchtime whatever the cause he mood in the fifties rarely rise above the level of the capably sardonic dulles he do not seem to have catch the subtlety of the man mccarthy the sky turn dark but the cloud do not loose they wrath suez low seem to have support eden at first and then relent because thing work out differently so there be no fire in he eye stalin s death churchill s farewell to public life hillary and tense on everest quemoy and matsu all subject for a noble anger or an accolade instead the cartoon seem to deal with foible they eisenhower be insubstantial do low decide to let well enough alone when he make he selection he often draw the bomb he show puny man attack by splendidly tyrannical machine and khrushchev turn out to be prime copy for the most witty caricaturist of they all but but and but look in this book for weak mortal and only on occasion for virtue and vice on the heroic scale read the moderately brief text not for caption sometimes for tart epigram once in a while for an explosion in the middle of you fix idea a gray fox with a patch on one eye confidence man city slick lebensraum specialist try to take over catfish bend in this third relax allegory from mr burman s refresh louisiana animal community the fox be all ingratiate smile when he arrive from new orleans accompany by one wharf rat but like all despot a he build he follow from among the gullible he grow more threaten toward those who will nt follow such solid citizen a doc raccoon judge black the vegetarian black snake and the eagle who lead the bird community when he be not too busy in washington pose for fifty-cent piece a soon a the fox have take hold on most of the populace he import more wharf rat who of course say they be the aggrieve victim of an extermination campaign in the city the follower of bully invariably be aggrieve about the very thing they plan to do to other they train the mink and other animal to fight and pretty soon gray fox be announce that he will nt have anyone around that s against he and set out to break he second territorial treaty with the bird robert hillyer the poet write in he introduction to this brief animal fable that mr burman ought to win a nobel prize for the catfish bend series he may have a point in urge that decadent theme be give fewer prize but it s hard to imagine mr burman a a nobel laureate on the basis of these charm but not really momentous fable in substance they lie somewhere between the southern dialect animal story of joel chandler harris uncle remus and the polish witty fable of jame thurber
