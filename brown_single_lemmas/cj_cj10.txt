apart from the honeybee practically all bee and bumblebee hibernate in a state of torpor occasionally you may come across one or two bumblebee in the cold season when you be turn over sod in you garden but you have to be a really keen observer to see they at all they keep they wing and foot press tightly against they body and in spite of they often colorful attire you may very well mistake they for lump of dirt i must add at once that these animal be what we call queen young female that have mate in the previous summer or autumn it be on they alone that the future of they race depend for all they relative mother husband brother and unmated sister have perish with the arrival of the cold weather even some of the queen will die before the winter be over fall prey to enemy or disease the survivor emerge on some nice sunny day in march or april when the temperature be close to 50-degrees and there be not too much wind now the thing for we to do be to find ourselves a couple of those wonderful flower currant such a the red ribes sanguineum of we pacific northwest or otherwise a good sloe tree or perhaps some nice pussy willow in bloom preferably one with male or staminate catkin the bloom of ribes and of the willow and sloe be the place where large number of we early insect will assemble honeybee bumblebee and other wild bee and also various kind of fly it be a happy buz crowd each male willow catkin be compose of a large number of small flower it be not difficult to see that the stamens of the catkin be always arrange in pair and that each individual flower be nothing but one such pair stand on a green black-tipped little scale by scrutinize the flower one can also notice that the scale bear one or two tiny wart those be the nectary or honey gland fig 26 page 74 the staminate willow catkin then provide they visitor with both nectar and pollen a marvelous arrangement for it provide exactly what the bee queen need to make they beebread a combination of honey and pollen with which the young of all species be feed the only exception to this be certain bee that have become parasite i will deal with these late on quite often honeybee form a majority on the willow catkin a we have already see in the first chapter bumblebee be big hairy and much more colorful than honeybee exhibit various combination of black yellow white and orange let we not try to key they out at this stage of the game and let we just call they bombus there must be several dozen species in the unite state alone if you really insist on know they name an excellent book on the north american species be bumblebee and they way by oe plath if we manage to keep track of a bombus queen after she have leave she feed place we may discover the snug little hideout which she have fix up for herself when she wake up from she winter sleep a befit a queen a bumblebee female be rather choosy and may spend considerable time search for a suitable nest place most species seem to prefer a ready-made hollow such a a desert mouse nest a bird house or the hole make by a woodpecker some show a definite like for make they nest in moss once she have make up she mind the queen start out by construct in she choose abode a small floor of dry grass or some woolly material on this she build an egg compartment or egg cell which be fill with that famous pollen-and-nectar mixture call beebread she also build one or two waxen cup which she fill with honey then a group of egg be deposit in a cavity in the beebread loaf and the egg compartment be close the queen afterward keep incubate and guard she egg like a mother hen take a sip from time to time from the rather liquid honey in she honey pot when the larva hatch they feed on the beebread although they also receive extra honey meal from they mother she continue to add to the pollen supply a need the larva keep warm by the queen be full grow in about ten day each now make a tough papery cocoon and pupate after another two week the first young emerge four to eight small daughter that begin to play the role of worker bee collect pollen and nectar in the field and care for the new young generation while the queen retire to a life of egg lay the first worker bee do not mate or lie egg male and mate female do not emerge until late in the season the brood of worker that appear late tend to be big than the first one probably because they be good feed by the middle of the summer many of the larva apparently receive such a good diet that it be optimal and it be then that young queen begin to appear simultaneously male or drone be produce mostly from the unfertilized egg of worker although a few may be produce by the queen the young queen and drone leave the nest and mate and after a short period of freedom the fertilize young queen will begin to dig in for the winter it be an amaze fact that in some species this will happen while the summer be still in full swing for instance in august the temperature then be still very high at the old nest the queen will in the early fall cease to lie the fertilize egg that will produce female a a result the proportion of male which leave the nest increase and eventually the old colony will die out completely the nest itself the structure that in some case house about 2000 individual when the season be at it peak be now rapidly destroy by the scavenging larva of certain beetle and moth not always though do the development of a bumblebee colony take place in the smooth fashion we have just describe some member of the bee family have become idler social parasite that live at the expense of they hardworking relative bumblebee can thus suffer severely from the onslaught of psithyrus the cuckoo-bumblebee a it be call in some european country female individual of psithyrus look deceptively like the worker and queen of the bumblebee they victimize the one sure way to tell victim and villain apart be to examine the hind leg which in the case of the idler psithyrus lack the pollen basket naturally the female parasite spend much time in she effort to find a nest of she host when she succeed she usually manage to slip in unobtrusively to deposit an egg on a complete loaf of beebread before the bumblebee seal the egg compartment the host never seem to recognize that something be amiss so that the compartment afterward be seal normally thus the larva of the intruder can develop at the expense of the rightful inhabitant and the store of beebread late on they and the mother psithyrus be feed by the bombus worker bad still in a number of case it have be claim that the psithyrus female kill the bombus queen but let we return after this gruesome interlude to we willow catkin in the spring there be other wild bee that command we attention it be almost certain that some of these usually a trifle small than the honeybee be andrenas or mine bee there be about 200 different kind of andrena in europe alone one of i favorite be a armata a species very common in england where it be sometimes refer to a the lawn bee the female like to burrow in the short turf of well-kept lawn where they little mound of earth often appear by the hundreds almost equal in size to a honeybee a armata be much more beautiful in color at least in the female of the species a rich velvety rusty red the male be much dull after have mate an andrena female dig a hole straight down into the ground form a burrow about the size of a lead pencil the bottom part of a burrow have a number of side tunnel or cell each of which be provide with an egg plus a store of beebread the development of the andrena larva be very rapid so that by the end of spring they have already pupate and become adult but they be still enclose in they larval cell and remain there throughout the summer fall and winter they appearance next spring coincide in an almost uncanny way with the flower of they host plant in the sacramento valley in california for instance it have be observe that there be not one day s difference between the emergence of the andrenas and the open of the willow catkin this must be due to a completely identical response to the weather in the plant and the animal after the male and female andrenas have mate the cycle be repeat although andrena be gregarious so that we may find hundreds and hundreds of burrow together we must still call it a solitary bee it life history be much simple than that of the truly colonial bumblebee and can serve a an example of the life cycle of many other species after all social life in the group of the bee be by no mean general although it certainly be a strike feature on the basis of it life history we like to think that andrena be more primitive than the bumblebee the way in which it transport it pollen be not so perfect either it lack pollen basket and possess only a large number of long branch hair on it leg on which the pollen grain will collect still andrena will do a reasonably good job so that an animal with a full pollen load look like a gay little piece of yellow down float in the wind closely relate to the andrenas be the nomias or alkali bee nomia melanderi can be find in tremendous number in certain part of the unite state west of the great plain for example in utah and central washington in the unite state department of agriculture s yearbook of agriculture 1952 which be devote entirely to insect george e bohart mention a site in utah which be estimate to contain 200000 nest female often the burrow be only an inch or two apart and the bee city cover several acre the life history of the alkali bee be similar to that of andrena but the first activity of the adult do not take place until summer and the individual hibernate in the prepupal stage in most place there be two generation a year a second brood of adult appear late in the summer i must plead guilty to a special sympathy for nomias this may just be pride in i adopt state of washington but certainly i love to visit they mound city near yakima and prosser in july or august when the bee be in they most active period the name alkali bee indicate that one have to look for they in rather inhospitable place sometimes although by no mean always these be indeed alkaline the thing be that these bee love a fine-grained soil that be moist yet the water in the ground should not be stagnant either they dislike dense vegetation where do one find such condition the good chance of course be offer by gently slope terrain where the water remain close to the surface and where the air be dry so that a high evaporation leave salty deposit which permit only sparse plant growth
