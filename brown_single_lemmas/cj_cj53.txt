the injure german veteran be a former miner twenty-four year old who have be wound by shrapnel in the back of the head this result in damage to the occipital lobe and very probably to the leave side of the cerebellum also in any event the extraordinary result of this injury be that he become psychically blind while at the same time apparently the sense of touch remain essentially intact psychical blindness be a condition in which there be a total absence of visual memory-images a condition in which for example one be unable to remember something just see or to conjure up a memory-picture of the visible appearance of a well-known friend in he absence this circumstance in the patient s case plus the fact that he tactual capacity remain basically in sound work order constitute it exceptional value for the problem at hand since the evidence present by the author be overwhelming that when the patient close he eye he have absolutely no spatial that be third-dimensional awareness whatsoever the necessary inference a the author themselves interpret it would seem to be this 1 spatial quality be not among those grasp by the sense of touch a such we do not arrive at spatial image by mean of the sense of touch by itself 2 spatiality become part of the tactual sensation only by way of visual representation that be there be in the true sense only a visual space the underlie assumption of course be that only sight and touch enable we in any precise and fully dependable way to locate object in space beyond we the other sense be decidedly inferior if not totally inadequate in this regard this be an assumption with which few would be dispose to quarrel therefore if the sense of touch be function normally and there be a complete absence of spatial awareness in a psychically-blind person when the eye be close and an object be handle the conclusion seem unavoidable that touch by itself can not focus and take possession of the third-dimensionality of thing and that actual sight or visual representation be necessary the force of the author analysis if indeed it have any force can be feel by the reader i believe only after three question have be successfully answer 1 what allow we to think that the patient have no third-dimensional representation when he eye be close 2 what evidence be there that he be psychically blind 3 how can we be sure that he sense of touch be not profoundly disturb by he head injury we shall consider these in the inverse order of they presentation obviously a satisfactory answer to the third question be imperative if the argument be to get under way at all for if there be any possibility of doubt whether the patient s tactual sensitivity have be impair by the occipital lesion any finding whatsoever in regard to the first question become completely ambiguous and fail altogether of course a evidence to establish the desire conclusion the answer the author give to it therefore be of supreme importance it be a follow the usual sensitivity test show that the specific quality of skin-perceptiveness pressure pain temperature a well a the kinesthetic sensation muscular feeling feeling in the tendon and joint be a such essentially intact although they seem in comparison with normal reaction to be somewhat diminish over the entire body the suppose tactual sense of spatial location and orientation in the patient and he ability to specify the location of a member a well a the direction and scope of a movement passively execute with one of he member prove to have be on the contrary very considerably affect the author insist however that these abnormality in the sense of touch be due absolutely to no organic disorder in that sense faculty but rather to the injury which the patient have sustain to the sense of sight first of all what be they evidence that the tactual apparatus be fundamentally undamaged 1 when an object be place in the patient s hand he have no difficulty determine whether it be warm or cold sharp or blunt rough or smooth flexible soft or hard and he could tell simply by the feel of it whether it be make of wood iron cloth rubber and so on and he could recognize by touch alone article which he have handle immediately before even though they be altogether unfamiliar to he and could not be identify by he that be he be unaware what kind of object they be or what they use be 2 the patient attain an astonish efficiency in a new trade because of he brain injury and the extreme damage suffer to he sight the patient have to train himself for a new line of work that of a portfolio-maker an occupation require a great deal of precision in the make of measurement and a fairly well-developed sense of form and contour it seem clear when one take into consideration the exceedingly defective eyesight of the patient we shall describe it in detail in connection with we second question the one concern the psychical blindness of the patient that he have to rely on he sense of touch much more than the usual portfolio-maker and that consequently that faculty be most probably more sensitive to shape and size than that of a person with normal vision and so the author conclude the conduct of the patient in he every-day life and in he work even more than the forego fact mention above under 1 leave positively no room for doubt that the sense of touch in the ordinary sense of the word be unaffected or to put the same thing in physiological term that the performance-capacity of the tactual apparatus from the periphery up to the tactual center in the brain that be from one end to the other be unimpaired if the argument be accept a essentially sound up to this point it remain for we to consider whether the patient s difficulty in orient himself spatially and in locate object in space with the sense of touch can be explain by he defective visual condition but before we can do this we must first find answer to we original question 1 and 2 then we shall perhaps be in a position to provide something like a complete answer to the question at hand in what way then do the patient s psychical blindness manifest itself he could not see object a unify self-contained and organize figure a a person do with normal vision the mean of this a we shall see be that he have no fund of visual memory-images of object a object and therefore he could not recognize even long-familiar thing upon see they again instead he constantly become lose in part and component of they confuse some of they detail with those of neighboring object and so on unless he allow time to trace the object in question through minute movement of the head and hand and in this way to discover it contour accord to he own testimony he never actually see thing a shape but only a generally amorphous blot of color of a more or less indefinite size at they edge they slip pretty much out of focus altogether but by the trace procedure he could in a strange obviously kinesthetic manner find the unseen form could piece a it be the jumble mass together into an organize whole and then recognize it a a man or a triangle or whatever it turn out to be if however the figure to be discern be complicate compose of several interlocking subfigures and so on even the trace process fail he and he could not focus even relatively simple shape among it part this mean concretely that the patient could not read at all without make writing-like movement of the head or body become easily confuse by hasher mark insert between hand-written word and thus confuse the mark for one of the letter and could recognize a simple straight line or a curve one only by trace it the patient himself deny that he have any visual imagery at all and there be ample evidence of the follow sort to corroborate he after a conversation with another man he be able to recount practically everything that have be say but could not describe at all what the other man look like nor could he call up memory-pictures of close friend or relative in short both he own declaration and he figural blindness when he look at object seem to present undeniable evidence that he have simply no visual memory at all he be oblivious of the form of the object actually be view precisely because he could not assign it to a visual shape already learn and hold in visual memory a person of normal vision do he could not recognize it he be absolutely unfamiliar with it because he have no visual memory at all therefore he only recourse be to learn the shape all over again for each new visual experience of the same individual object or type of object and this he could do only by go over it mass with the trace procedure then he might finally recognize it apparently by combine the visual blot actually be see with tactual feeling in the head or body accompany the trace movement this would mean it can readily be see that again for each new visual experience the trace motion would have to be repeat because of the absence of visual imagery a one would surmise the procedure however could be repeat with the same object or with the same type of object often enough so that the correspond visual blot and the mere begin of the trace movement would provide clue a to the actual shape which the patient then immediately could determine by a kind of inference man tree automobile house and so on object continually confront in everyday life have each it characteristic blot-appearance and become easily recognizable at the very begin of trace by an inference a to what each be dice for example he infer from black dot on a white surface he evidently could not actually see the corner of these object but they size and the dot give they away and the author give numerous instance of calculate guess on the patient s part to show how large a role it play in he process of readapting himself and how proficient he become at it often he seem even to have be able to guess correctly without the trace motion solely on the basis of qualitative difference among the blot-like thing which appear in he visual experience perhaps the very important question what be then exactly the role of kinesthetic sensation in the patient s ability to recognize form and shape by mean of the trace movement when he be actually look at thing have now be raise in the reader s mind and in the follow form if the patient can perceive figure kinesthetically when he can not perceive it visually then it would seem the sense of touch have immediate contact with the spatial aspect of thing in independence of visual representation at least in regard to two dimension and a we shall see even this much spatial awareness on the part of unaided touch be deny by the author how then do the kinesthetic sensation function in all this the author set about answer this fundamental question through a detail investigation of the patient s ability tactually 1 to perceive figure and 2 to locate object in space with he eye close or turn away from the object concern quite naturally they make the investigation first by prohibit the patient from make any movement at all and then late by repeat it and allow the patient to move in any way he want to when the patient be not allow to move he body in any way at all the follow strike result occur
