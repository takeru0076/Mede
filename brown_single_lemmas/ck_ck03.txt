of joy that dig into the bone marrow of the spirit he have not because he be both poor and ambitious poverty impose a kind of chastity on the ambitious they can not stop to grasp and embrace and sit in the back seat of car along a dark country lane no they must look the other way and climb one more painful step up the ladder he make the decision with he eye open or so he think at any cost he must leave the dreary pennsylvania mine town where he father be a pharmacist and so he have so he have at state college he have no time to walk among the violet on the water s edge from he room he could look out in springtime and see the couple hand in hand walk slowly deliciously across the campus and he could smell the sweet vernal wind he be not stone he be not unmoved he have to teach himself patiently that these trap be not for he he must mentally pull the blind and close the window so that all that exist be in the book before he at law school the same more of this stamp down of human emotion a a young lawyer in new york by the time he be prosperous enough he goal be high he be bald and afraid of woman the only one who would have he be he cripple the strange unhappy woman who

a piece of meat you could tell be bad by it smell lawrence stare a minute at the light ribbon of traffic hope that a clue to he dislike of the vice president would appear it do not therefore he decide he be unfair to the young man and should make an effort to understand and sympathize with he point of view a half hour late the vice president arrive he look very carefully at every piece of furnish a though hope to store this information carefully in he mind he observe the florentine vase in the hall the renoir painting in the library a well a the long shelf of well-bound volume the pattern of the oriental rug the delicate cut-glass chandelier he say to the secretary i understand you come from a little pennsylvania town near wilkes-barre how do you find out about this he wave he arm around at the furnishing it be not a discourteous question lawrence decide this young man have so little time to learn he have to be curious he have to find out the secretary do not tell he at what cost at what loneliness he learn these thing he merely say any good decorator these day can make you a tasteful home the vice president say if you hear of any name that would fix i cheap in return for advertise they decorate the vice president s home let i know i can do business with that kind again lawrence think a little sadly these be the fee of poverty and ambition boxell do not have the chance to grow up graciously he have to acquire everything he be go to get in four year they have brandy in the library boxell look at lawrence with a search glance the kind that a prosecute attorney would give a man on trial what be you weakness where will you break how good to destroy you peace the vice president say with a slight bluster there be nt anyone who love the president more than i do old chris be i ideal at the same time you have to face fact and realize that a man who s be in the marine corps all he life do nt understand much about politics what do a monk know about sex lawrence listen with the practice deceptive calm of the lawyer but he face be in the shadow so we have to protect the old man for he own good you see what i mean congress be full of politician and if you want to get along
