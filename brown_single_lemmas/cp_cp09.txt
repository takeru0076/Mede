over the road with he drive and the headlight sweep the pike ahead and after he hit college he expansiveness the quaint little pine board tourist court cabin really with a cute naked light bulb in the ceiling unfrosted and naked a a streetlight like the one on the corner where you use to play when you be a kid where you watch the bat swoop in after the bug watch in between you bout at hopscotch a room complete with moth ping the light and the few casual cockroach cruise the wall an insect highway patrol with feeler wave and the bed that sag in a certain place where all the weight have be put too many time before and the wall fine and thin for overhear talk in the next room when gratt go out for ice the sound come through the wall like something on the other side of the curtain so you know they hear you when they be quiet and while you lie wonder what they have hear you listen and gratt shafer would be in memphis today for the wedding rehearsal and then tomorrow he would marry just like everybody know he would just like everybody know all along like mattie and the mayor up there grip the microphone and toonker burkette back in he office yank out tooth like they all know he would just like the balloon would go up and you could sit all day and wish it would spring a leak or blow to hell up and burn and nothing like that would happen or you could hope the parachute would nt open just so you could say you see it not open not because you mean any harm to starkey poe in he suit of red underwear but mainly because you be tire of be an old maid a thing which can not admit when it think it might be pregnant but must stand the dizzy feel all alone and go on like everything be all right instead of be able to say to somebody in a normal voice i think i m pregnant you could wish that or you could wish you daddy would really do it kill gratt shafer like he say when you all the time all along could feel the nerve drain out of he like air out of a puncture tire when you be on a muddy road alone and it be rain and at night so you sit in the car and listen to the air run out and listen to the rain and see the mud in front of the headlight wait for you for you new spectator pump wait for you to squat by yourself out there in you tight skirt cry and afraid and try to get that damn son-of-a-bitch tire off because that be be an old maid too if you happen to drive a car it be change the tire yourself in the night and in the mud and the rain hate to get out in it but afraid to stay and afraid to try to walk out for help and every sound that might be the rain also might be the man who think after he have rape you he have to beat you brain out with a tire tool so you will nt tell a combination like ham and egg rape she and kill she and that be be an old maid too it be not have he baby nestle warm and fat against you breast and it be not have somebody that really give a damn whether some tramp crack you skull and most of all it be not have the only man you could love whether he drive a bread truck or deliver the mail or check the berry crate down at the shed or own seventeen oil well and six diamond mine for if you be anybody what he be or do make no difference if he be the one he can even be a mild-voiced little-town guy with big-town idea and level gray eye and a heart even houdini could nt figure out how it be unlock and he can be on the way to memphis you gratt shafer can and you discover you can stay alive and hate he and love he and want he even if it mean you want he really want he dead because if you can nt then nobody else can either nobody else can have he for you do nt share he not even with god if it be love you do nt and i ll take you with i even if that s all the promise he ever give or ever will give the give of it once be enough and you believe it then and you will always believe it even when it be finally the only thing in the world you have leave to believe and the whole world be tell you that one be a lie even when he be on the way to memphis you will still have the promise rest inside you like a gift and it be he inside of you and in a way the promise work out true for whether he want you or not you go with he in you heart you feel he every mile far away you feel where he be and what he see and at night you feel when he be asleep or with the other woman the one that never could love he the way you do the one who get he because she do nt particularly give a damn whether she get he or do nt and you know you will always wonder all of you life whether it be because you want he so bad that you do nt get he and you can feel nearly sorry enough to cry when you think of that other guy the chump who beg you to marry he the one with the plaster hair and the car he could nt afford and the too-shiny shoe you think do he feel that way about i it come to you that probably he do feel that way to let you use he like you do when you could nt have gratt shafer that he must have since he be there like the radio for you to turn on or snap off when you get tire of he that other guy it dawn on you that instead of a lump to fill the seat across the bridge table from you he be a man and that because gratt shafer be make you miserable you be pass it down to he to gratt shafer s substitute that other guy and you wonder if that be why the little man lose he job and he car and stay drink about a year before he straighten out and move to st louis where he get to be a big unhappy success you wonder if he look at he wife now and think of you you wonder about the christmas card with no name on it and it come to you that maybe it would have be good to have make somebody else happy if you could nt be happy yourself to give somebody else the one they want to give they you damn the world she think she look out at the corn field the great green deep acre of it roll out like the sea in the field beyond the whitewash fence border the ground the mayor envision factory there home and factory and school and a big wide federal highway instead of peaceful corn to rest you eye on while you try to rest you heart while you try not to look at the balloon and the bandstand and the uniform and the flash of the instrument the band be impatient but they be the only one the other the one in the stand be spellbound for hear the mayor be for they like listen to a symphony be for sophisticate folk in new york city it be like be in the concert hall in the afternoon and hear the piano virtuoso rehearse he be good and they know that what he be do for they he would do all over the unite state some day so they stay quiet and hang not on what he say but on how he say it not listen exactly but rather feel if a man be good if he be go to be governor you feel it and you want he to go on forever you be sorry when he finish talk because while he be up there you be someone else and the world be something else too it be a place full of courage and hope and you be part of it you laugh and then you chest swell and you feel you could cry for a little bit and then a feel hit you like a chill in you stomach and the goose bump ripple along you arm he hit the theme about die to defend you country and you be ready to do it right then without a second think while he talk you would nt trade be a west tennessee farmer for be anything else in the whole damn world no matter if it have nt in six week rain enough to wet a rat s ass she glance at the man nod beside she a man with weather crack furrow into he lean cheek with powdery pale eye reflect all the drought he have see reflect the sky and the drought which must follow now in august yes with eye predict the drought and here it be only june only festival time again and thought of gratt shafer would not leave she i should have stay at the store she think back at the factory-to-you with the other old maid back there she be the young clerk and she be thirty-four which make she young enough to resent the usual ideal work condition like the unventilated toilet with the door you have to hold shut while you sit down there be no lock because herman do nt allow a lock a lock on the toilet would encourage malinger and primp the toilet have nt have a sincere scrub in year and there be thing write on the wall of the little boxed-in place because you could nt keep the public out entirely she could not count the time herman have rap on the door just a couple of bang that shake the whole damn closet and might someday break away the pipe connection from the wall the two little bang mean that he be get impatient to have a crowd of customer wait on and that if he have to he would jerk open the door and drag out by the opposite door handle which she would be clutch whichever-the-hell clerk it be who think she could waste so much store time on the pot and the hour be six-thirty in the morning until eleven at night on saturday and during sales and there be no chair and you could nt smoke and the cool be overhead fan and there be no porter or janitor
