copernicus do not question it ptolemy could not give the conceptual context within which ancient think thrive how could anyone have question this principle the reason for this be partly observational partly philosophical and reinforce by other aesthetic and cultural factor first the observational reason the obvious natural fact to ancient thinker be the diurnal rotation of the heaven not only do constellation like draco cepheus and cassiopeia spin circle around the pole but star which be not circumpolar rise and set at the same place on the horizon each night nor do a constellation s star vary in brightness during the course of they nocturnal flight the conclusion the distance of the constellation do not vary and they path be circular moreover the sun s path over earth describe a segment of a great circle this be clear from the contour of the shadow trace by a gnomon before and after noon a early a the 6th century bc the earth be see to be spherical ship disappear hull-first over the horizon approach shore they mast appear first earth be at the center of the universe would have the same shape a the latter so eg do aristotle argue although this may not be an observational reason in favor of circularity the discoid shape of sun and moon be also feel to indicate the shape of celestial thing in light of all this one would require special reason for say that the path of the heavenly body be other than circular why for example should the ancient have suppose the diurnal rotation of the heaven to be elliptical or oviform or angular there be no reason for such supposition then this conjoin with the consideration above make the circular motion of heavenly body appear an almost directly observe fact additional philosophical consideration advance notably by aristotle support far the circularity principle by distinguish superlunary celestial and sublunary terrestrial existence and reinforce this with the four-element physics of empedocles aristotle come to speak of the star a perfect body which move in only a perfect way viz in a perfect circle now what be perfect motion it must apparently be motion without terminus because motion which begin and end at discrete place would eg for aristotle be incomplete circular motion however since it be eternal and perfectly continuous lack terminus it be never motion towards something only imcomplete imperfect thing move towards what they lack perfect complete entity if they move at all do not move towards what they lack they move only in accordance with what be in they nature thus circular motion be itself one of the essential characteristic of completely perfect celestial existence to return now to the four-element physics a mixture of muddy frothy water will when stand in a jar separate out with earth at the bottom water on top and the air on top of that a candle alight in the air direct it flame and smoke upwards this give a clue to the cosmical order of element thus earth have fall to the center of the universe it be cover partly with water air be atop of that pure fire the star be in the heaven when combine with the metaphysical notion that pure form of this universe be good appreciate when least embody in a material substratum it become clear that while earth will be dross on a scale of material-formal ratio celestial body will be of a subtle quicken ethereal existence in whose embodiment pure form will be the dominant component and matter will be absent or remain subsidiary the star constitute an order of existence different from what we encounter on earth this be clear when one distinguish the type of motion appropriate to both region a projectile shoot up from earth return rectlinearly to it natural place of rest but the natural condition for the heavenly body be neither rest nor rectilinear motion be less encumber by material embodiment they partake more of what be divine they motion will be eternal and perfect let we re-examine the publicize contrast between ptolemaic and copernican astronomy bluntly there never be a ptolemaic system of astronomy copernicus achievement be to have invent systematic astronomy the almagest and the hypothesis outline ptolemy s conception of he own task a the provision of computational table independent calculate device for the prediction of future planetary perturbation indeed in the halma edition of theon s presentation of the hypothesis there be a chart set out under six distinct heading otherwise unrelated diagram for describe the planetary motion no attempt be make by ptolemy to weld into a single scheme a-la-aristotle these independent predicting-machines they all have this in common the earth be situate near the center of the deferent but that one should superimpose all these chart run a pin through the common point and then scale each planetary deferent large and small to keep the epicycles from bump this be contrary to any intention ptolemy ever express he might even suppose the planet to move at infinity ptolemy s problem be to forecast where against the invert bowl of night some particular light will be find at future time he problem concern longitude latitude and angular velocity the distance of these point of light be a problem he can not master beyond crude conjecture a to the ordering of the planetary orbit view outward from earth but none of this have prevent scientist philosopher and even historian of science from speak of the ptolemaic system in contrast to the copernican this be a mistake it be engender by confound the aristotelian cosmology in the almagest with the geocentric astronomy ptolemy recurrently deny that he could ever explain planetary motion this be what necessitate the nonsystematic character of he astronomy so when textbook like that of baker set out drawing of the ptolemaic system complete with earth in the center and the seven heavenly body epicyclically arrange on they several deferents we have nothing but a mislead 20th-century idea of what never exist historically it be the chief merit in copernicus work that all he planetary calculation be interdependent he can not eg compute the retrograde arc travel by mar without also make supposition about the earth s own motion he can not describe eclipse without entertain some form of a three-body problem in ptolemaic term however eclipse and retrograde motion be phenomenon simpliciter to be explain directly a possible resultant of epicyclical combination in a systematic astronomy like that of copernicus retrogradations become part of the conceptual structure of the system they be no long a puzzle aspect of intricately variable local planetary motion another contrast stress when discuss ptolemaic vs copernican astronomy turn on the idea of simplicity it be often state that copernican astronomy be simple than ptolemaic some even say that this be the reason for the ultimate acceptance of the former thus margenau remark a large number of unrelated epicycles be need to explain the observation but otherwise the ptolemaic system serve well and with quantitative precision copernicus by place the sun at the center of the planetary universe be able to reduce the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen historical record indicate that copernicus be unaware of the fundamental aspect of he so-called revolution unaware perhaps of it historical importance he rest content with have produce a simple scheme for prediction a an illustration of the principle of simplicity the heliocentric discovery have a peculiar appeal because it allow simplicity to be arithmetized it involve a reduction in the number of epicycles from eighty-three to seventeen without careful qualification this can be mislead if in any one calculation ptolemy have have to invoke 83 epicycles all at once while copernicus never require more than one third this number then in the sense obvious to margenau ptolemaic astronomy would be simple than copernican but no single planetary problem ever require of ptolemy more than six epicycles at one time this of course result from the non-systematic cellular character of ptolemaic theory calculation within the copernican framework always raise question about planetary configuration these could be meet only by consider the dynamical element of several planet at one time this be more ambitious than ptolemy be ever require to be when he face he isolate problem thus in no ordinary sense of simplicity be the ptolemaic theory simple than the copernican the latter require juggle several element simultaneously this be not simple but much more difficult than exercise within ptolemy s astronomy analogously anyone who argue that einstein s theory of gravitation be simple than newton s must say rather more to explain how it be that the latter be master by student-physicists while the former can be manage with difficulty only by accomplish expert in a sense einstein s theory be simple than newton s and there be a correspond sense in which copernicus theory be simple than ptolemy s but simplicity here refer to systematic simplicity the number of primitive idea in systematically-simple theory be reduce to a minimum the axiom require to make the theoretical machinery operate be set out tersely and powerfully so that all permissible operation within the theory can be trace rigorously back to these axiom rule and primitive notion this characterize euclid s formulation of geometry but not ptolemy s astronomy there be in the almagest no rule for determine in advance whether a new epicycle will be require for deal with abberation in lunar solar or planetary behavior the strong appeal of the copernican formulation consist in just this ideally the justification for deal with special problem in particular way be completely set out in the basic rule of the theory the lower-level hypothesis be never ad hoc never introduce ex post facto just to sweep up within the theory some recalcitrant data copernicus to an extent unachieved by ptolemy approximate to euclid s vision de revolutionibus be not just a collection of fact and technique it be an organize system of these thing solve astronomical problem require for copernicus not a random search of unrelated table but a regular employment of the rule define the entire discipline hence note the simplicity achieve in copernicus formulation do not provide another reason for the acceptance of de revolutionibus another reason beyond it systematic superiority it provide exactly the same reason 1543 ad be often venerate a the birthday of the scientific revolution it be really the funeral day of scholastic science grant the cosmological philosophical and cultural reverberation initiate by the de revolutionibus be feel with increase violence during the 300 year to follow but consider within technical astronomy a different pattern can be trace in what do the dissatisfaction of copernicus-the-astronomer consist what in the almagest draw he fire geocentricism per se no the formal displacement of the geocentric principle far from be copernicus primary concern be introduce only to resolve what seem to he intolerable in orthodox astronomy namely the unphysical triplication of centric reference-points one center from which the planet s distance be calculate another around which planetary velocity be compute and still a third center the earth from which the observation originate this arrangement be for copernicus literally monstrous with the ptolemaists it be a though an artist be to gather the hand foot head and other member for he image from diver model each part excellently draw but not relate to a single body and since they in no way match each other the result would be a monster rather than a man copernicus require a systematically integrate physically intelligible astronomy he objective be essentially to repair those aspect of orthodox astronomy responsible for it deficiency in achieve these end that such deficiency exist within ptolemy s theory be not discover de novo by copernicus the critical rigorous examination of nicholas of cusa and nicholas of oresme provide the context a late medieval context for nicholas copernicus own work the latter look backward upon inherit deficiency without abandon too much copernicus seek to make orthodox astronomy systematically and mechanically acceptable he do not think himself to be fire the first shoot of an intellectual revolution
