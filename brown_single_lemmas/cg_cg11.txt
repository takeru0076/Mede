a cell coalesce into organism they build new unnatural and internally control environment to cope even more successfully with the entropy-increasing property of the external world the useful suggestion of professor david hawkins which consider culture a a third stage in biological evolution fit quite beautifully then with we suggestion that science have provide we with a rather successful technique for build protective artificial environment one wonder about it applicability to people will advance in human science help we build social structure and government which will enable we to cope with people a effectively a the primitive combination of protein and nucleic acid build a structure of molecule which enable it to adapt to a sea of molecular interaction the answer be of course yes for the family be the simple example of just such a unit compose of people which give we both some immunity from and a way of deal with other people social invention do not have to await social theory any more than use of the warmth of a fire have to await lavoisier or the buoyant protection of a boat the formulation of archimede but it have be during the last two century during the scientific revolution that we independence from the physical environment have make the most rapid stride we have ample light when the sun set the temperature of we home be independent of the season we fly through the air although gravity pull we down the range of we voice ignore distance at what stage be social science then be the future of psychology akin to the rich future of physics at the time of newton there be a haunt resemblance between the notion of cause in copernicus and in freud and it be certainly no slight to either of they to compare both they achievement and they impact political theoretical understand although almost at a standstill during this century do develop during the eighteenth and nineteenth century and result in a flood of invention which increase the possibility for man to coexist with man consitutional government popular vote trial by jury public education labor union cooperative commune socialize ownership world court and the veto power in world council be but a few example most of these with horrible exception be conceive a be a ship not a an attempt to quell the ocean of mankind nor to deny it force but a a mean to survive and enjoy it the most effective political invention seem to make maximum use of natural harbors and be aware that restrain breakwater can play only a minor part in the whole scheme just a present technology have to await the explanation of physics so one might expect that social invention will follow grow sociological understand we be desperately in the need of such invention for man be still very much at the mercy of man in fact the accumulation of the hardware of destruction be day by day increase we fear of each other 3 i want therefore to discuss a second and quite different fruit of science the connection between scientific understand and fear there be certainly large area of understand in the human science which in themselves and even without political invention can help to dispel we present fear lucretius have remark the reason why all mortal be so grip by fear be that they see all sort of thing happen in the earth and sky with no discernable cause and these they attribute to the will of god perhaps thing be even bad then it be difficult to reconstruct the primeval fear of man we get some clue from a few remembrance of childhood and from the circumstance that we be probably not much more afraid of people now than man ever be we be not now afraid of atomic bomb in the same way that people once fear comet the bomb be a harmless a an automobile in a garage we be worry about what people may do with they that some crazy fool may push the button i be certainly not adequately train to describe or enlarge on human fear but there be certain feature of the fear dispel by scientific explanation that stand out quite clearly they be in general those fear that once seem to have be amenable to prayer or ritual they include both individual fear and collective one they arise in situation in which one believe that what happen depend not only on the external world but also on the precise pattern of behavior of the individual or group often it be recognize that all the detail of the pattern may not be essential to the outcome but because the pattern be empirically determine and not develop through theoretical understand one be never quite certain which behavior element be effective and the whole pattern become ritualize yet often fear persist because even with the most rigid ritual one be never quite free from the uneasy feel that one might make some mistake or that in every previous execution one have be unaware of the really decisive act to say that science have reduce many such fear merely reiterate the obvious and frequent statement that science eliminate much of magic and superstition but a somewhat more detail analysis of this process may be illuminate the frequently postulate antique worry that the daylight hour might dwindle to complete darkness apparently give rise to a ritual and celebration which we still recognize it be curious that even century of repetition of the yearly cycle do not induce a sufficient degree of confidence to allow people to abandon the ceremony of the winter solstice this and other fear of the solar system have disappear gradually first with the ptolemaic system and it built-in concept of periodicity and then more firmly with the newtonian innovation of an universal force that could account quantitatively for both terrestial and celestial motion this understand provide a very simple example of the fact that one can eliminate fear without institute any control in fact although we have dispel the fear we have not necessarily assure ourselves that there be no danger there be still the remote possibility of planetoid collision a meteor could fall on san francisco solar activity could presumably bring long period of flood or drought we understand of the solar system have teach we to replace we former elaborate ritual with the appropriate action which in this case amount to do nothing yet we no long feel uneasy this almost trivial example be nevertheless suggestive for there be some element in common between the antique fear that the day would get short and short and we present fear of war we in we country think of war a an external threat which if it occur will not be primarily of we own do and yet we obviously also believe that the avoidance of the disaster depend in some obscure or at least uncertain way on the detail of how we behave what element of we behavior be decisive we weapon production we world prestige we idea of democracy we action of trust or stubbornness or secrecy or espionage we have stave off a war and since we behavior have involve all these element we can only keep add to we ritual without dare to abandon any part of it since we have not the slight notion which part be effective i think that we be here also talk of the kind of fear that a young boy have for a group of boy who be approach at night along the street of a large city if an automobile be approach he he would know what be require of he even though he might not be able to act quickly enough with the group of boy it be different he do not know whether to look up or look aside to put he hand in he pocket or to clench they at he side to cross the street or to continue on the same side when confront with a drink or an insane person i have no notion of what any one of they might do to i or to himself or to other i believe that what i do have some effect on he action and i have learn in a way to commune with drunk but certainly i action seem to resemble more nearly the performance of a rain dance than the carry out of an experiment in physics i be usually fill with an uneasiness that through some unwitting slip all hell may break loose we inability to explain why certain people be fond of we frequently induce the same kind of ritual and malaise we be force in we behavior towards other to adopt empirically successful pattern in toto because we have such a minimal understand of they essential element we collective policy group and national be similarly base on voodoo but here we often lack even the empirically successful ritual and be still engage in determing they we use term from we personal experience with individual such a trust cheat and get tough we talk about national character in the same way that copernicus talk of the compulsion of celestial body to move in circle we perform elaborate international exhortation and ceremony with virtually no understand of social cause and effect small wonder then that we fear the achievement which dispel we fear of the cosmos take place three century ago what additional role have the scientific understand of the 19th and 20th century play in the physical science these achievement concern electricity chemistry and atomic physics in the life science there have be an enormous increase in we understand of disease in the mechanism of heredity and in bio - and physiological chemistry the major effect of these advance appear to lie in the part they have play in the industrial revolution and in the tool which scientific understand have give we to build and manipulate a more protective environment in addition we way of deal directly with natural phenomenon have also change even in domain where detail and predictive understand be still lack but where some explanation be possible a with lightning and weather and earthquake the appropriate kind of human action have be more adequately indicate apparently the population a a whole eventually acquire enough confidence in the explanation of the scientist to modify it procedure and it fear how and why this process occur would provide an interest separate subject for study in some area the progress be slow than in other in agriculture for example despite the advance in biology elaborate ritual tend to persist along with a continue sense of the imminence of some natural disaster in child care the opposite extreme prevail procedure change rapidly and parental confidence probably exceed anything warrant by establish psychological theory there be many domain in which understand have bring about widespread and quite appropriate reduction in ritual and fear much of the former extreme uneasiness associate with vision and hallucination and with death have disappear the persistent horror of have a malformed child have i believe be reduce not because we have gain any control over this misfortune but precisely because we have learn that we have so little control over it in fact the recent warning about the use of x-ray have introduce fear and ambiguity of action which now require more detail understand and thus in this instance science have momentarily aggravate we fear in fact insofar a science generate any fear it stem not so much from scientific prowess and gadget but from the fact that new unanswered question arise which until they be understand create uncertainty perhaps the most illuminate example of the reduction of fear through understand be derive from we increase knowledge of the nature of disease the situation with regard to we attitude and control of disease contain close analogy to problem confront we with respect to people the fear of disease be formerly very much the kind of fear i have try to describe
