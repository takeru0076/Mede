recent criticism of great expectation have tend to emphasize it symbolic and mythic content to show a md zabel have say of dicken generally that much of the novel s impact reside in it allegoric insight and moral metaphor jh miller s excellent chapter on great expectation have lately illustrate how fruitfully that novel can be read from such a perspective in he analysis however he touch upon but fail to explore an idea generally neglect in discussion of the book which i believe be central to it art the importance of human hand a a recur feature of the narrative this essay seek to make that exploration dicken be not for nothing the most theatrical of the great victorian writer he know instinctively that next to voice and face an actor s hand be he most useful possession that in fiction a in the theatre gesture be an indispensable shorthand for individualize character and dramatize action and response it be hardly accidental therefore that many of he most vivid figure do suggestive or eccentric thing with they hand in great expectation the hand become almost an obsession mr jaggers habitually bite he forefinger a gesture which convey both contempt and the inscrutable abstractedness that half fascinate half terrify all who have dealing with he miss havisham s wither hand heavy a if she unhappiness be somehow concentrate in they move in restless self-pity between she break heart and she walk stick pumblechook s signature be the perpetually extend glad hand wemmick reveal he self-satisfaction by regularly rub he hand together old mr pocket s frantic response to life imprisonment with a useless social-climbing wife be to put he two hand into he disturb hair and make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it whereas joe gargery endure the shrewish onslaught of mrs joe by apologetically draw the back of he hand across and across he nose such mannerism would be less worthy of remark be it not that in great expectation a in no other of dicken novel hand serve a a leitmotif of plot and theme a kind of unify symbol or natural metaphor for the book s complex of human interrelationship and the value and attitude that motivate they dicken not only reveal character through gesture he make hand a crucial element of the plot a mean of clarify the structure of the novel by help to define the hero s relation with all the major character and a device for order such diverse theme a guilt pursuit crime greed education materialism enslavement by both people and institution friendship romantic love forgiveness and redemption we have only to think of lady macbeth or the policeman-murderer in thoma burke s famous story the hand of mr ottermole to realize that hand often call up idea of crime and punishment so it be with great expectation whether the hand be orlick s a he strike down mrs gargery or pip s a he steal a pie from she pantry such association suit well with the gothic or mystery-story aspect of dicken novel but on a deep plane they relate to the theme of sin guilt and pursuit that have recently be analyze by other critic the novel open with a fugitive convict frantically try to avoid the nemesis of be lay hand on a mysterious figure who look into pip s frighten eye in the churchyard a if he be elude the hand of the dead people stretch up cautiously out of they grave to get a twist upon he ankle and pull he in magwitch terrify pip into steal a pork pie for he by create the image in the boy s imagination of a bogy man who may softly creep he way to he and tear he open imbruing he hand in he a pip agonizes over the theft that he own hand have commit he guilty conscience project itself upon the wooden finger of a local signpost transform it into a phantom devote i to the hulk hold upside down in the graveyard pip cling in terror with both hand to he convict late he flee in panic from the family table just a he theft be about to be discover and be block at the front door by a soldier who accusingly hold out a pair of handcuff which he have bring to gargery s forge for mend through such detail dicken indicate at the outset that guilt be a part of the ironic bond between pip and magwitch which be so unpredictably to alter both they life since they commonly translate thought and feeling into deed hand naturally represent action and since nearly half the character in great expectation be of the underworld or closely ally to it the link of hand with crime or violence be not to be wonder at dicken for excellent psychological reason never fully reveal magwitch s felonious past but pip at the convict s climactic reappearance in london shrink from clasp a hand which he fear might be stain with blood orlick slouch about the forge like cain with he hand in he pocket and when he shout abuse at mrs joe for object to he holiday she clap she hand in a tantrum beat they upon she bosom and upon she knee and clench they in she husband s hair this last rampage be only the prelude to the vicious blow upon she head deal by some unknown hand whose identity be late reveal not verbally but through a manual action the trace of orlick s hammer upon a slate pip himself be to feel the terror of orlick s murderous hand in he secret rendezvous at the sluicehouse on the marsh dicken lay great emphasis on the hand in this scene orlick shake he hand at pip bang the table with he fist draw he unclench hand across he mouth a if he mouth water for he victim let he hand hang loose and heavy at he side and pip observe he so intensely that he know of the slight action of he finger orlick might almost be magwitch s bogy man come alive a figure of nemesis from pip s phantasy of guilt the scar disfigure wrist of mr jaggers housekeeper be the tell-tale mark of she sinister past for she master coolly exhibit they to he dinner guest make a point of the force of grip there be in these hand jaggers iron control over she she would remove she hand from any dish she put before he hesitatingly a if she dread he call she back rest on he have once get she acquit of a murder charge by cleverly contrive she sleeve at the trial to conceal she strength and by pass off the laceration on the back of she hand a the scratch of bramble rather than of human fingernail it be the similarity between estella s hand and molly s the action of she finger be like the action of knit that provide pip with a vital clue to the real identity of both and establish a symbolic connection between the underworld of crime and the genteel cruelty of satis house finally magwitch s pursuit of compeyson he archenemy and betrayer begin by he hold he in a vicelike grip on the river flat to frustrate he escape and culminate in he lay he hand on he cloak to identify he thus precipitate the death-locked struggle in the water during which compeyson drown magwitch s hand here ironically become the agent of justice but only in one of it aspect be great expectation a tale of violence revenge and retribution money so important a theme elsewhere in dicken be here central and hand be often associate in some way with the false value acquisitiveness snobbery self-interest hypocrisy toadyism irresponsibility injustice that attach to a society base upon the pursuit of wealth dicken suggest the economic evil of such a society on the first page of he novel in the description of pip s five little dead brother who give up try to get a live exceedingly early in that universal struggle who seem to have all be bear on they back with they hand in they trousers-pockets and have never take they out in this state of existence pip s great expectation he progress through illusion and disillusionment turn somewhat a they do for the naive hero of dreiser s american tragedy upon the lure of genteel prosperity through unearned income what wemmick call portable property and what jaggers reproach pip for let slip through he finger since a gentleman must if possible avoid sully they by work he hand a importantly a he accent become the index of social status almost the first step in the corruption of pip s value be the unworthy shame he feel when estella cruelly remark the coarseness of he hand they have never trouble i before but they trouble i now a vulgar appendage pip imagine how estella would look down upon joe s hand roughen by work in the smithy and the deliberate contrast between she white hand and he blacken one be make to symbolize the opposition of value between which pip struggle idleness and work artificiality and naturalness gentility and commonness coldness and affection in fact between satis house and the forge when the snobbery that alienate pip from joe finally give way before the deep and strong force of love the reunion be mark by an embarrass handshake at which pip exclaim no do nt wipe it off for god s sake give i you blacken hand pip s abject leave-taking of miss havisham during which he kneel to kiss she hand signalizes he homage to a suppose patroness who seem to be open up for he a new world of glamour when on the journey to london that immediately follow he pause nostalgically to lie he hand upon the finger-post at the end of the village the wooden pointer symbolically designate a spiritual frontier between innocence and the corruption of worldly vanity incidentally one can not miss the significance of this gesture for dicken reintroduce it associatively in pip s mind at another moral and psychological crisis he painful recognition in a talk with herbert pocket that he hopeless attachment to estella be a self-destructive a it be romantic in both case the finger-post represent pip s heighten awareness of contrary magnetisms a variety of hand movement help dramatize the moral climate of the fall world pip encounter beyond the forge the vulture-like attendance of the pocket family upon miss havisham be sum up in the hypocritical gesture of miss camilla pocket who put she hand to she throat in a feign spasm of grief-stricken choke then lay it upon she heave bosom with an unnatural fortitude of manner and finally kiss it to miss havisham in a parody of the lady s own mannerism toward estella pumblechook s

indenture a an apprentice and late pump pip s hand for the hundredth time at least may i may i in effusive congratulation to pip on he expectation we take leave of pumblechook a he gloat over pip s

latter s ingratitoode and he own generosity a pip s early benefactor pip first learn the stupendous power of money from the sycophantic tailor mr trabb whose brutality to he boy helper exactly match the financial resource of each new customer and whose fawn hand touch the outside of each elbow and rub pip out of the shop the respectability which money confer imply a different etiquette and upon take up the life of a london gentleman pip must learn from herbert pocket that the spoon be not generally use over-hand but under
