writer of this class of science fiction have clearly in mind the assumption that man can master the principle of this cause-and-effect universe and that such mastery will necessarily good the human lot on the other hand the bright vision of the future have be directly state in science fiction concern with project ideal society science fiction of course be relate if sometimes distantly to that utopian literature optimistic about science literature whose period of great vigor in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century produce edward bellamy s look backward and hg well s a modern utopia in arthur clarke s childhood s end 1953 though write after the present flood of dystopia begin we can see the bright vision of science fiction clearly define childhood s end apparently indebted to kurd lasswitz s utopian romance auf zwei planeten 1897 and also to well s history of the future especially the world set free 1914 and the shape of thing to come 1933 describe the bloodless conquest of earth by the overlord vastly superior creature who come to we world in order to prepare the human race for it next stage of development an eventual merge with the composite mind of the universe arrive just in time to stop man from turn they planet into a radioactive wasteland the overlord unite earth into one world in which justice order and benevolence prevail and ignorance poverty and fear have cease to exist under they rule earth become a technological utopia both abolition of war and new technique of production particularly robot factory greatly increase the world s wealth a situation describe in the follow passage which have the true utopian ring everything be so cheap that the necessity of life be free provide a a public service by the community a road water street light and drainage have once be a man could travel anywhere he please eat whatever he fancy without hand over any money with destructive tension and pressure remove man have the vigor and energy to construct a new human life rebuild entire city expand facility for entertainment provide unlimited opportunity for education indeed for the first time give everyone the chance to employ he talent to the full mankind a a result attain previously undreamed of level of civilization and culture a golden age which the overlord a very evident symbol of science have help produce by introduce reason and the scientific method into human activity thus science be the savior of mankind and in this respect childhood s end only blueprint in great detail the vision of the future which though not always so directly state have nevertheless be present in the mind of most science-fiction writer consider then the optimism which have permeate science fiction for so long what be really remarkable be that during the last twelve year many science-fiction writer have turn about and attack they own cherish vision of the future have attack the childhood s end kind of faith that science and technology will inevitably good the human condition and they have do this on a very large scale with a veritable flood of novel and story which be either dystopia or narrative of adventure with dystopian element because of the mean of publication science-fiction magazine and cheap paperback and because dystopian science fiction be still appear in quantity the full range and extent of this phenomenon can hardly be know though one fact be evident the science-fiction imagination have be immensely fertile in it extrapolation among the dystopia for example isaac asimov s the cave of steel 1954 portray the deadly effect on human life of the super-city of the future jame blish s a case of conscience 1958 describe a world hide from it own weapon of destruction in underground shelter ray bradbury s fahrenheit 451 1954 present a book-burning society in which wall television and hearing-aid radio enslave man s mind walter m miller jr s a canticle for leibowitz 1959 find man after the great atomic disaster stumble back to they previous level of civilization and another catastrophe frederick pohl s the mida touch 1954 predict an economy of abundance which in order to remain prosperous must set it robot to consume surplus production clifford d simak s how-2 1954 tell of a future when robot have take over leave man nothing to do and robert sheckley s the status civilization 1960 describe a world which frighten by the power of destruction science have give it become static and conformist a more complete list would also include bradbury s the pedestrian 1951 philip k dick s solar lottery 1955 david karp s one 1953 wilson tucker s the long loud silence 1952 jack vance s to live forever 1956 gore vidal s messiah 1954 and bernard wolfe s limbo 1952 a well a the three perhaps most outstanding dystopia frederik pohl and cm kornbluth s the space merchant 1953 kurt vonnegut s player piano 1952 and john wyndham s re-birth 1953 work which we will late examine in detail the novel and story like pohl s drunkard s walk 1960 with the focus on adventure and with the dystopian element only a dim background in this case an uneasy overpopulate world in which the mass of people do uninteresting routine job while a carefully select university-trained elite run everything be in all likelihood a numerous a dystopia there be of course nothing new about dystopia for they belong to a literary tradition which include also the closely relate satiric utopia stretch from at least a far back a the eighteenth century and swift s gulliver s travel to the twentieth century and zamiatin s we capek s war with the newt huxley s brave new world em forster s the machine stop cs lewis s that hideous strength and orwell s nineteen eighty-four and which in science fiction be represent before the present deluge a early a well s trilogy the time machine a story of the day to come and when the sleeper wake and a recently a jack williamson s with fold hand 1947 the classic story of man replace by they own robot what make the current phenomenon unique be that so many science-fiction writer have reverse a trend and turn to write work critical of the impact of science and technology on human life since the great flood of these dystopia have appear only in the last twelve year it seem fairly reasonable to assume that the chief impetus be the 1949 publication of nineteen eighty-four an assumption which be support by the frequent echo of such detail a room 101 along with education by condition from brave new world a book to which science-fiction writer may well have return with new interest after read the more powerful orwell dystopia not all recent science fiction however be dystopian for the optimistic strain be still very much alive in mission of gravity and childhood s end a we have see a well a in many other recent popular novel and story like fred hoyle s the black cloud 1957 and among work of dystopian science fiction not all provide intelligent criticism and very few have much merit a literature but then real quality have always be scarce in science fiction in addition there be many area of the human situation besides the impact of science and technology which be examine for science-fiction dystopia often extrapolate political social economic tendency only indirectly relate to science and technology nevertheless with all these qualification and exception the current dystopian phenomenon remain impressive for it criticism that science and technology instead of bring utopia may well enslave dehumanize and even destroy man how effectively these warning can be present be see in pohl and kornbluth s the space merchant vonnegut s player piano and wyndham s re-birth easily the good know of these three novel be the space merchant a good example of a science-fiction dystopia which extrapolate much more than the impact of science on human life though it most important warn be in this area namely a to the use to which discovery in the behavioral science may be put the novel which be not merely dystopian but also brilliantly satiric describe a future america where one-sixteenth of the population the man who run advertise agency and big corporation control the rest of the people the submerge fifteen-sixteenths who be the worker and consumer with the government be no more than a clear house for pressure like ours the economy of the space merchant must constantly expand in order to survive and like ours it be base on the principle of ever increase everybody s work and profit in the circle of consumption the consequence of course have be dreadful reckless expansion have lead to overpopulation pollution of the earth and depletion of it natural resource for example even the most successful executive life in a two-room apartment while ordinary people rent space in the stairwell of office building in which to sleep at night soyaburgers have replace meat and wood have become so precious that it be save for expensive jewelry and the atmosphere be so befoul that no one dare walk in the open without respirator or soot plug while the space merchant indicate a kingsley amis have correctly observe some of the impending consequence of the growth of industrial and commercial power and satirize exist habit in the advertise profession it warn and analysis penetrate much deep what be wrong with advertise be not only that it be an outrage an assault on people s mental privacy or that it be a major cause for a wasteful economy of abundance or that it contain a coercive tendency which be close to the point rather what kornbluth and pohl be really do be warn against the danger inherent in perfect a science of man and he motive the space merchant like such humanist document a joseph wood krutch s the measure of man and cs lewis s the abolition of man consider what may result from the scientific study of human nature if man be actually the product of he environment and if science can discover the law of human nature and the way in which environment determine what people do then someone a someone probably stand outside traditional system of value can turn around and develop completely efficient mean for control people thus we will have a society consist of the planner or conditioner and the control and this of course be exactly what madison avenue have be accuse of do albeit in a primitive way with it hide persuader and what the space merchant accomplish with much great sophistication and precision pohl and kornbluth s ad man have long since throw out appeal to reason and develop technique of advertise which tie in with every basic trauma and neurosis in american life which work on the libido of consumer which be link to the great prime motivation of the human spirit a the hero mitchell courtenay explain before he conversion the job of advertise be to convince people without let they know that they re be convince and to do this require first of all the kind of information about people which be provide by the scientist in industrial anthropology and consumer research who for example tell courtenay that three day be the optimum prime period for a close social circuit to be trigger with a catalytic cue-phrase which mean that an effective propaganda technique be to send an idea into circulation and then three day late reinforce or undermine it and the second requirement for convince people without they knowledge be artistic talent to prepare the word and picture which persuade by use the principle which the scientist have discover thus the copywriter in the world of the space merchant be the person who in early age might have be a lyric poet the person capable of put together word that stir and move and sing a courtenay explain here in this profession we reach into the soul of man and woman and we do it by take talent and redirect it now the basic question to be ask in this situation be what motivate the manipulator that be what be they value since a courtenay say nobody should play with life the way we do unless he s motivate by the high ideal but the only ideal he can think of be sales indeed again and again the space merchant confirm the prediction of the humanist that the conditioner and behavioral scientist once they have see through human nature will have nothing except they impulse and desire to guide they
