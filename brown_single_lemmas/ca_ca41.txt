a philosopher may point out that the trouble of the congo begin with the old adam and consequently will never end but a historian might put he finger on a specific man and date and hold out the hope that the trouble will sometime pass away the man be king leopold 2 of the belgian who in 1885 conclude that he have good grab a colony while the grab be still good by force he take under he protection or steal 900000 square mile of wilderness in central africa this be an area nearly a large a western europe and it be fill then a now by quarreling tribe with no political or historical unity it boundary have nothing to do with geography or ethnic grouping they be determine by the point at which leopold s explorer and gunman get tire of walk the population of the congo be 135 million divide into at least seven major culture cluster and innumerable tribe speak 400 separate dialect the religion of the people include christianity mohammedanism paganism ancestor worship and animism the climate range from the steamily equatorial to the temperate the hospital contain patient trample by elephant or run over by sport car to make one nation out of these disparity would be a problem large enough in any case it have be make far more difficult by what the belgian have do or fail to do in the congo since 1885 at first the belgian royal family administer the congo a it own private property but by 1908 it record of brutality have touch the national conscience the belgian government itself take over administration commence a program of paternalism unmatched in the history of colonialism one definition of paternalism be the principle or practice on the part of a government of manage the affair of a country in the manner of a father deal with he child the honor of the belgian in this matter be not to be question only they judgment ordinarily a father permit he child to grow up in due time but when the colony receive independence in 1960 the congolese child if one imagine he to have be bear in 1908 be 52 and have until then be treat a an infant the belgian be interest primarily in the economic development of the congo which be rich in copper tin cobalt manganese zinc and uranium and cotton and palm oil the colony be administer from brussels with neither the congolese nor the resident belgian have any vote the beneficiary of this administration be a number of huge cartel in which both individual and the belgian government itself hold stock in inside africa john gunther describe one of these the societe generale a the kind of colossus that might be envisage if let we say the house of morgan anaconda copper the mutual life insurance company of new york the pennsylvania railroad and various company produce agricultural product be lump together with the unite state government a a heavy partner have they be truly ruthless the belgian might have exploit the congolese without compassion but they be not they provide a social security system which cover all they african employe they program of mass medical care be doubtless the good on the continent they put much effort into public house they also institute a ration system under which all employer in the congo be require to furnish they employe with clothing and adequate food but instead of deliver the ration either in actual commodity or in cash at interval of perhaps two week or a month the belgian feel oblige to dole it out more often would not the child if they receive all they food on the first day of the month eat it up immediately and late go hungry the belgian also place great emphasis on education during the 1950s there be a many a 25000 school in the congo but almost all the school be primary the average congolese can do little more than puzzle out the mean of la chatte and le chien and write he name some school be technical the belgian need carpenter and mechanic to help exploit the land and train many but they do not believe in widespread secondary education much less in college it be they conviction that the people should be bring up together a grade at a time until in some indefinite future some might be ready to tackle history economics and political science indeed the belgian discourage high education fear the creation of a native intellectual elite which might cause unrest when the congo receive it independence in 1960 there be among it 135 million people exactly 14 university graduate why do the belgian grant independence to a colony so manifestly unprepared to accept it in one large oversimplification it might be say that the belgian feel far too late the gale of nationalism sweep africa they lack time to prepare the congo a the british and french have prepare they colony the congolese be clamoring for they independence even though most be unsure what it mean and in brussels street crowd shout pa une goutte de sing not one drop of blood the belgian would not fight for the privilege of be the detest pedagogue rather than teach where teach be not want they would wash they hand of the mess it be hard to blame they for this yet there be other motivation and action which the belgian take after independence for which history may not find they guiltless a the time for independence approach there be in the congo no fewer than 120 political party or approximately eight for each university graduate there be four principal one first there be those congolese among they joseph kasavubu who favore split the country into small independent state balkanizing it second there be those moise tshombe who favore near-balkanization a loose federalism have a central government of limit authority with much power reside in the state third there be those notably patrice lumumba who favore a unify congo with a very strong central government and fourth there be moderate who be in no hurry for independence and wish to wait until the congo grow up however the position of all party and leader be constantly shift a final factor which contribute greatly to the fragmentation of the congo immediately after independence be the provincial structure that have be establish by the belgian for convenience in administration they have divide the congo into six province leopoldville kasai kivu katanga equator and eastern unfortunately with little regard for ethnic grouping thus some province contain tribe which detest each other and to they independence mean an opportunity for war the belgian congo be grant it independence with what seem a workable western-style form of government there be to be a president and a premier and a bicameral legislature elect by universal suffrage in the province well-wisher around the world hope that the congo would quickly assume a respectable position in the society of nation if internal friction arise they could be handle by the 25000-man congolese army the force publique which have be train and be still officer by white belgian the president joseph kasavubu seem an able administrator and the premier patrice lumumba a reasonable man twenty-four hour after independence the wild tribesman commence fight each other presently the well-armed member of the force publique many of they draw from savage and even cannibalistic tribe erupt in mutiny riot rape and loot terror engulf the thousands of belgian civilian who have remain in the country the belgian government decide to act and on july 10 dispatch paratroop to the congo on july 11 the head of the mineral-rich province of katanga moise tshombe announce that he province have secede from the country confusion become chaos each succeed day bring new act of violence lumumba and kasavubu blame it all on the military intervention by the belgian and appeal to the unite nation to send troop to oust they on july 14 the security council with france and great britain abstain vote the resolution which draw the un into the congo vague in word it call for withdrawal of belgian troop and authorize the secretary-general to take the necessary step to provide the congolese government with such military assistance a may be necessary until through the effort of the congolese government with the technical assistance of the unite nation the national security force may be able in the opinion of the government to meet fully they task secretary-general hammarskjold decide that it would be preferable if the un troop send into the congo be to come from african or at least nonwhite nation certainly not from the we russia great britain or france he quickly call on ghana tunisia morocco guinea and mali which dispatch troop within hour ultimately the un army in the congo reach a top strength of 19000 include about 5000 from india and a few soldier from eire and sweden who be the only white it take the un three month to bring a modest form of order to the congo the belgian be reluctant to withdraw they troop and often obstruct un effort the wildly erratic nature of patrice lumumba cause constant problem he frequently announce that he want the un to get out of the congo along with the belgian and appeal to russia for help however there be little evidence that the late lumumba be a communist before appeal to the un or to russia he first appeal to the we for military help and be reject lumumba far complicate the un s mission by initiate small war with the secessionist province of katanga and with south kasai which under albert kalonji want to secede a well meanwhile russia take every opportunity to meddle in the congo send lumumba equipment for he war dispatch technician and even threaten on occasion to intervene openly but by the end of the three-month period in october 1960 something approach calm settle on the congo president kasavubu become exasperate with lumumba and fire he lumumba fire kasavubu control of the government such control a there be and such government a there be pass into the hand of joseph mobutu chief of staff of the congolese army mobutu promptly fling out the russian who have not since play any significant part on the local scene although they have redouble they obstructionist effort at un headquarters in new york the belgian at least officially depart from the congo a well withdraw all of they uniformed troop but they leave behind they large number of officer variously call volunteer or mercenary who now staff the army of moise tshombe in katanga the secede province which accord to tshombe hold 65 % of the mineral wealth of the entire country from october 1960 to february 1961 the un force in the congo take little action there be no directive for it the security council s resolution have not mention political matter and in any case the unite nation by the term of it charter may not interfere in the political affair of any nation whether to unify it federalize it or balkanize it during the five-month lull civil war smoldered and flicker throughout the congo in february the murder of patrice lumumba who have be kidnaped into katanga and execute on order of tshombe again stir the un to action on feb 21 the council pass another resolution urge the take of all appropriate measure to prevent the occurrence of civil war in the congo include the use of force if necessary in the last resort although the resolution might have be far more specific it be considerably tough than the early one it also urge that the un eject and prevent the return of all belgian and other foreign military and political adviser order an investigation of lumumba s death urge the reconvention of the congolese parliament and the reorganization of the army
