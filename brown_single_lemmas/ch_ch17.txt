importance of the question in the administration of the act 361 we 899 we have conclude that petitioner s claim be control by the rationale of gonzales v unite state 348 we 407 1955 and unite state v nugent 346 we 1 1953 and therefore affirm the judgment petitioner register with local board no 9 boulder colorado on march 17 1952 he answer to the classification questionnaire reflect that he be a minister of jehovah s witness employ at night by a sugar producer he claim 4-d classification a a minister of religion devote a minimum of 100 hour a month to preach on november 13 1952 he be classify in class 1-a on november 22 1952 he write the board protest this classification he again state that he be a regular minister that he be devote an average of 100 hour a month to actual preach publicly in addition to 50 to 75 hour in other ministerial duty and that he oppose war in any form thereafter he be classify 1-o on april 1 1953 after some six month of full-time pioneer petitioner discontinue devote 100 hour a month to preach but fail to so notify he local board in a periodic review the local board on july 30 1953 reclassify he 1-a and upheld this classification after a personal appearance by petitioner because of he willingness to kill in defense of he church and home upon administrative approval of the reclassification he be order to report for induction on june 11 1956 but fail to do so he be not prosecute however and he case be subsequently reopen in the light of sicurella v unite state 348 we 385 1955 he be again reclassify 1-a by the local board there follow a customary department of justice hear at which petitioner appear in he report to the attorney general the hear officer suggest that the petitioner be exempt only from combatant train and service on march 21 1957 however the department recommend approval of the 1-a classification it ground for this recommendation be that while petitioner claim before the local board august 17 1956 a evidence by it memorandum in he file of that date that he be devote 100 hour per month to actual preach the headquarters of the jehovah s witness report that he be no long do so and on the contrary have relinquish both he pioneer and bible student servant position it report that he now devote only some 6-12 hour per month to public preach and from 20 to 25 hour per month to church activity he claim be therefore so highly exaggerate the department conclude that it cast doubt upon he veracity and consequently upon he sincerity and good faith the appeal board furnish petitioner a copy of the recommendation in he answer thereto he advise the board that he have make no such statement in 1956 and assert that he only claim to pioneer be in 1952 the appeal board however unanimously concur in the department s recommendation upon return of the file to the local board petitioner be again order to report for induction and this prosecution follow he failure to do so petitioner first contend that the department deny he procedural due process by not give he timely opportunity before it final recommendation to the appeal board to answer the statement of the local board a to he claim of devote 100 hour to actual preach but the statement of the local board attribute this claim to petitioner be in he file he admit that he know it be open to he at all time and he could have rebut it before the hear officer this he fail to do assert that he do not know it to be in he file apparently he never take the trouble to find out nevertheless he have ample opportunity to contest the statement before the appeal board after the recommendation of the department be forward to the appeal board that be the appropriate place for a registrant to lodge he denial this he do we find in gonzales v unite state supra that this be the control reason why copy of the recommendation should be furnish a registrant we say there that it be necessary that a registrant be give an opportunity to rebut the department s recommendation when it come to the appeal board the agency with the ultimate responsibility for classification 348 we at 412 we fail to see how such procedure result in any prejudice to petitioner s contention which be consider by the appeal board and deny by it a be say in gonzales it be the appeal board which render the selective service determination consider final in the court not to be overturn unless there be no basis in fact estep v unite state 327 we 114 348 we at 412-413 but there be other contention which might be consider more difficult at he trial petitioner seek to secure through subpoena duce tecum the longhand note of the department s hear officer evensen a well a he report thereon petitioner also claim at trial the right to inspect the original federal bureau of investigation report to the department of justice he allege no specific procedural error or evidence withhold nor do he elaborate just what favorable evidence the federal bureau of investigation report might disclose section 6 j of the act a we have hold do require the department s recommendation to be place in a registrant s file gonzales v unite state supra but there be nothing in the act require the hear officer s report to be likewise turn over to the registrant while the regulation formerly require that the hear officer s report be place in the registrant s file this requirement be eliminate in 1952 moreover the hear officer s report be but intradepartmental be direct to the attorney general and of course be not the recommendation of the department it be not essentially different from a memorandum of an attorney in the department of justice of which the attorney general receive many and to which he may give he approval or rejection it be but part of the whole process within the department that go into the make of the final recommendation to the appeal board it be also significant that neither this report nor the hear officer s note be furnish to the appeal board hence the petitioner have full opportunity to traverse the only conclusion of the department on file with the board petitioner know that the department s recommendation be base not on the hear officer s report but on the statement of the local board in he file have have every opportunity to rebut the find of the local board before both the hear officer and the appeal board petitioner can not now claim that he be deny due process because he do not succeed it appear to we that the same reason apply to the production of the hear officer s report and note at the trial in addition petitioner have fail to show any particular need for the report and note while there be now allegation of the withhold of favorable evidence develop at the hear and a denial of a full and fair hear no such claim be make by petitioner at any stage of the administrative process moreover he testimony at trial never develop any such fact in the light of these circumstance a well a the fact that the issue at trial in this respect center entirely on the department s recommendation which petitioner repudiate but which both the appeal board and the court below find support by the record we find no relevancy in the hear officer s report and note finally petitioner say that he be entitle to inspect the fbi report during the proceeding before the hear officer a well a at the trial he do receive a resume of it the same that be furnish the appeal board and he make no claim of it inaccuracy even now no such claim be assert he base he present contention on the general right to explore indicate that he hope to find some discrepancy in the resume but this be fully answer by unite state v nugent supra there we hold that the statutory scheme for review within the selective service system entitle conscientious objector to no guarantee that the fbi report must be produce for they inspection 346 we at 5-6 even if we be not bind by nugent petitioner here would not be entitle to the report the recommendation of the department a well a the decision of the appeal board be base entirely on the local board file not on an fbi report
