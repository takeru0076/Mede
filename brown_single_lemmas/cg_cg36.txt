overcoat mount to the wind-swept roof of the un there begley light a fire in a wire basket and bang-jensen drop four seal envelope into the flame in one of these he say be note on the identity of the eighty-one refugee the method of destroy the evidence embarrass paul bang-jensen he know it would be imply that it be do in this way at he insistence he be right and peter marshall could not help but recall andrew cordier s word on the subject well it seem a good a place a any to do the job the gross group have be form for the express purpose of advise the secretary general hammarskjold s suppose desire to seek outside legal advice in the guise of erne gross be illusion at good gross s be outside the un apply only to a physical state not an objective one but by the time the paper be finally dispose of the group have inform the world of it purpose it recommendation and it belief that paul bang-jensen be not of sound mind shortly the group would issue it report to the secretary general recommend paul bang-jensen s dismissal from the unite nation the content of this 195-page document would become know to many before it would become know to the man it be write about until this hungarian committee matter come up bang-jensen be a fine and devote individual i have know he for some year when i be a delegate and before and this manner have never be he erne a gross lean back in he chair and tell peter marshall how secretary general dag hammarskjold have on december 4 1957 call he in a a private lawyer to review bang-jensen s conduct relate to he association with the special committee on the problem of hungary the result be the gross report prepare by gross a chairman with the assistance of two un under secretary constantin stavropoulos and philippe de seynes yes gross go on bang-jensen be an up-and-coming young man he have always do well never well know but he have do he work competently gross have receive marshall courteously and they be discuss the case you know the lawyer say it s difficult to talk like this about a man who can nt answer back gross be behind a clean-top desk only a manila folder before he marshall sit in one of the several leather chair outside the office window twenty-four story above wall street a light rain be fall mr gross you report say that we function be investigative and advisory and do not in any way derogate from or prejudice mr bang-jensen s right a a staff member you know bang-jensen characterize you committee a have prejudge he case gross swing he swivel chair well how could that have be i do nt consider that he be prejudge we be give a job and we carry it out and late he case be take up by the disciplinary committee we have nothing to hide under a bushel we do we job mr stavropoulos and mr de seynes and myself take evidence from a number of people what do you think about he mental state i think we report sum up we find gross answer do nt forget here be a man who have be accuse he colleague for almost a year of willfully attempt to present an incorrect report this be not merely allege error but be carry out by day-after-day allegation in memo write charge of serious consequence this be a distressing thing suppose you or i be be accuse in this manner and yet we be do we level good to carry on we work no organization can carry on like that i ve be in government and i can tell some pretty hairy story about personnel difficulty so i know what a problem he be what i d like you to comment on be the criticism leveled at you committee what do you mean for instance regard the fact that the gross committee issue two interim announcement to the press during it investigation you know bang-jensen be tell the committee be to convey it view suggestion and recommendation to the secretary general in he own word bang-jensen take it for grant that the group would report to the secretary general privately and not in public he claim that the release of the preliminary finding be prejudicial to he position gross bristle for an instant he glare speechless at marshall listen he say i think the entire report be go to be confidential from begin to end but you know bang-jensen launch an active campaign against we in the press it be get so that we the committee be be try you can find it in the paper well a a matter of fact i ve look through back-issue file of new york paper for december 1957 and have nt find a great deal gross shoot another look at marshall it be nt necessarily all here in new york do nt forget the foreign press then what about the second interim public announcement this cite bang-jensen s aberrant conduct the reason for that report be to settle the matter of the list a far a i m concern it be a separate matter from the general committee study of bang-jensen s conduct the january fifteen report recommend that bang-jensen be instruct to burn the list the paper in the presence of a un security officer how about you press conference three day late what be the reason for that bang-jensen say you tell correspondent that you have check in advance to make sure the term aberrant conduct be not libelous he claim you make other slanderous allegation gross pause and repeat himself the entire object of the press conference be to clarify the problem of the list since many in the press be query the un about it what be the list i do nt know bang-jensen never explain what the document or paper be that he have in he possession it be foolish of he to keep they whatever they be he could have be blackmail or he family might have be threaten of course the matter catch the public s attention we attempt to conclude this and do so by have the paper burn hammarskjold do nt like the way it be carry out it be a sort of gotterdammerung affair hammarskjold believe the un be an organization that settle matter in a procedural way peter marshall reflect if hammarskjold have not want the list dispose of in this manner and if bang-jensen have not want it who have order it mr gross concern the formation of you committee there s the fact that you have be a legal adviser to the un in the past a i understand it mr hammarskjold want outside advice could you comment on that i ve serve a a counsel for the un for some year specialize particularly in real estate matter or other problem that the regular un legal staff might not be equip to handle mr stavropoulos be the un legal chief and a very good man but he be not fully verse on some technical point of american law what do you think about bang-jensen s contention of error and omission in the hungarian report marshall ask those gross answer why mick shann go over and over the report with alsing andersen try to check they out even after the incident between bang-jensen and shann in the delegate lounge and this be not the way the chicago tribune present it gross reach in he desk and pull out two newspaper clipping one be an article on the un by alice widener from the cincinnati enquirer the other be by chesly manley in the chicago daily tribune gross point to the manley story i know ch he s a friend of i he probably do nt mean to write it this way or maybe he do there be nt any violent argument between bang-jensen and shann a the tribune put it that imply that shann be on the enemy side you see what i mean how it s phrase there the word violent the case be that bang-jensen come up to shann claim he have find far error in the report i ve find error and i want you to look they over so once again shann have to argue with he about this but it be nt a violent discussion and after all this shann go over all that bang-jensen have bring up shann s own report peter marshall reflect describe the encounter a immoderate bang-jensen be in hysterical condition gross stop briefly then go on shann be responsible for the report he have feel terrible about all this it be a good report he do all he could to make it a good report when i speak of how shann feel i know well do nt forget i be an old member of the club a former delegate i think you be be unfair to take these thing up now you know this hit in many area it appeal to those who be frustrate in the outcome of the hungarian situation do nt forget the un do no more than the unite state do it take a great deal of sophisticate think to get the impact of this fact chapter 22 from the home of he friend henrik kauffmann in washington dc paul bang-jensen send a telegram date december 9 1957 to erne gross it say in part the matter to be consider be obviously of a grave character and i therefore respectfully request that the hear be postpone for two week in order that i might make adequate preparation erne gross reply the next day put the suspend diplomat s fear to rest this reveal some misunderstanding on you part the group conduct the review be not hold formal hearing it wish to pursue in the course of this review question arise from the body of material already in it possession it sound like a fair enough invitation peter marshall reflect and bang-jensen must have think so too because on the thirteenth he meet the group of three on the thirty-sixth floor of the un there erne gross far assure he we be request by the secretary general a i understand it to discuss with you such matter a appear to we to be relevant and we be not of course either a formal group or a committee in the sense of be guide by any rule or regulation of the secretariat the only rule which i think we shall follow will be those of common sense justice and fairness peter marshall note that bang-jensen have late refer to he two interview with the gross group a unfortunate experience and after he second meet on the sixteenth the dane refuse to attend far hearing without legal counsel marshall ponder the reason for this and ponder too the replacement of one member of the three-man group jac robertson after serve gross one week leave for england
