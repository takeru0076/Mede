it be not easy for the therapist to discern when in the patient s communicate an introject have appear and be hold sway one learn to become alert to change in he vocal tone to he voice s suddenly shift to a quality not like he usual one a quality which sound somehow artificial or in some instance parrot-like the content of he word may lapse back into monotonous repetition a if a phonograph needle be stick in one groove only seldom be it so simple a to be a matter of he obviously parrote some timeworn axiom common to we culture which he have evidently hear over and over from a parent until he experience it a part of he one hebephrenic woman often become submerge in what feel to i like a somehow phony experience of pseudo-emotion during which despite she wrack sob and stream cheek i feel only a cold annoyance with she eventually such incident become more sporadic and more sharply demarcate from she day-after-day behavior and in one particular session after several minute of such behavior which a usual go on without any accompany word from she she ask eagerly do you see granny at first i do not know what she mean i think she must be see i a some one who have just come from see she grandmother in they distant home-city then i realize that she have be deliberately show i this time what granny be like and when i reply in this spirit she corroborate i hunch at another phase in the therapy when a pathogenic mother-introject begin to emerge more and more upon the investigative scene she mutter in a low but intense voice to herself i hate that woman inside i i could evoke no far elaboration from she about this but a few second late she be stand directly across the room from i look i in the eye and say in a scathingly condemnatory tone you father despise you again i at first misconstrue this disconcertingly intense communication and i quickly cast through i mind to account for she be able to speak with such utter conviction of an opinion hold by i father now several year deceased then i reply coldly if you despise i why do nt you say so directly she look confuse at this and i feel sure it have be a wrong response for i to make it then occur to i to ask be that what that woman tell you she clearly agree that this have be the case i realize now that she have be show i in what impress i a be a very accurate way something she mother have once say to she it be a if she be show i one of the reason why she hate that woman inside she what have be an unmanageably powerful introject be now despite it continue charge of energy disconcert to i sufficiently within control of she ego that she could use it to show i what this introject mother be like early this woman have be so fill with a chaotic variety of introject that at time when she be in she room alone it would sound to a passerby a though there be several different person in the room a she would vocalize in various kind of voice a somewhat less fragment hebephrenic patient of i who use to often seclude herself in she room often sound through the close door a i would find on pass by between we session for all the world like two person a scold mother and a defensive child particularly hard for the therapist to grasp be those instance in which the patient be manifest an introject traceable to something in the therapist some aspect of the therapist of which the latter be himself only poorly aware and the recognition of which a a part of himself he find distinctly unwelcome i have find time and again that some bit of particularly annoy and intractable behavior on the part of a patient rest in the final analysis on this basis and only when i can acknowledge this to myself a be indeed an aspect of i personality do it cease to be a prominently troublesome aspect of the patient s behavior for example one hebephrenic man use to annoy i month after month by say whenever i get up to leave and make i fairly steoreotyped comment that i would be see he on the follow day or whenever you re welcome in a notably condescend fashion a though it be he due for i to thank he for the privilege of spend the hour with he and he be thus point up i failure to utter a humbly grateful thank you to he at the end of each session eventually it become clear to i partly with the aid of another schizophrenic patient who could point out i condescension to i somewhat more directly that this man with he condescend you re welcome be very accurately personify an element of obnoxious condescension which have be present in i own demeanor over these month on each of these occasion when i have bid he good-bye with the console note each time that the healing christ would be stoop to dispense this succor to the poor sufferer again on the morrow another patient a paranoid woman for many month infuriate not only i but the ward-personnel and she fellow patient by arrogantly behave a though she own the whole build a though she be the only person in it whose need be to be meet this behavior on she part subside only after i have come to see the uncomfortably close similarity between on the one hand she arrange the ventilation of the common live room to she own like or turn the television off or on without regard to the wish of the other and on the other hand i own come stolidly into she room despite she persistent and vociferous objection bring i big easy chair with i usually shut the window of she room which she prefer to keep in a very cold state and plunking myself down in i chair in short behave a if i own she room 4 condensation here a variety of meaning and emotion be concentrate or reduce in they communicative expression to some comparatively simple-seeming verbal or nonverbal statement one find for example that a terse and stereotyp verbal expression seem at first to be a mere hollow convention reveal itself over the month of therapy a the vehicle for express the most vary and intense feeling and the most unconventional of meaning more than anything it be the therapist s intuitive sense of these latent meaning in the stereotype which help these meaning to become reveal something like a spread-out deck of card on sporadic occasion over the passage of the patient s and he month of work together one can not assume of course that all these accumulate meaning be inherent in the stereotype at the begin of the therapy or at any one time late on when the stereotype be utter probably it be correct to think of it a a matter of a well-grooved stereotyp mode of expression and no or but a few other communicational groove a yet be there available for the patient s use a newly-emerging emotion and idea well up in he over the course of month but it be true that the therapist can sense when he hear this stereotype that there be at this moment many emotional determinant at work in it a blur babel of indistinct voice which have yet to become clearly delineate from one another sometimes it be not a verbal stereotype a how be you now or an i want to go home or whatever but a nonverbal one which reveal itself gradually a the condense expression of more than one latent mean a hebephrenic man use to give a repetitious wave of he hand a number of time during he largely-silent hour with he therapist when the therapist come to feel on sufficiently sure ground with he to ask he what be that bill hello or farewell the patient reply both dearie two in one of all the possible form of nonverbal expression that which seem good to give release and communicational expression to complex and undifferentiated feeling be laughter it be no coincidence that the hebephrenic patient the most severely dedifferentiated of all schizophrenic patient show a one of he characteristic symptom laughter laughter which now make one feel scorn or hate which now make one feel like weep or which now give one a glimpse of the bleak and empty expanse of man s despair and which more often than all these convey a welter of feeling which could in no way be convey by any number of word word which be so unlike this welter in be form and discrete from one another to a much less full extent the hebephrenic person s belch or flatus have a comparable communicative function in work with these patient the therapist eventually get to do some at least private mull over of the possible mean of a belch or the passage of flatus not only because he be reduce to this for lack of anything else to analyze but also because he learn that even these animal-like sound constitute form of communication in which from time to time quite different thing be be say long before the patient can become sufficiently aware of these a distinct feeling and concept to say they in word a i have be intimate in the schizophrenic and perhaps also in the dream of the neurotic this be a question which i have no wish to take up condensation be a phenomenon in which one find not a condense expression of various feeling and idea which be at an unconscious level well sort out but rather a condense expression of feeling and idea which even in the unconscious have yet to become well differentiate from one another freeman cameron and mcghie in they description of the disturbance of think find in chronic schizophrenic patient say in regard to condensation that the lack of adequate discrimination between the self and the environment and the object contain therein in itself be the prototypical condensation in i experience a great many of the patient s more puzzle verbal communication be so for the reason that concrete meaning have not become differentiate from figurative meaning in he subjective experience thus he may be refer to some concrete thing or incident in he immediate environment by some symbolic-sounding hyperbolic reference to transcendental event on the global scene recently for example a paranoid woman s large-scale philosophize in the session about the intrusive curiosity which have become in she opinion a deplorable characteristic of mid-twentieth-century human culture develop itself before the end of the session into a suspicion that i be surreptitiously peek at she partially expose breast a indeed i be or equally often a concretistic-seeming particularistic-seeming statement may consist with it mundane exterior in a form of poetry may be full of mean and emotion when interpret a a figurative expression a metaphor a smile an allegory or some other symbolic mode of speak of such hide meaning the patient himself be more often than not entirely unaware he subjective experience may be a remarkably concretistic one one hebephrenic woman confide to i i live in a world of word a if to she word be fully concrete object burnham in he excellent article 1955 concern schizophrenic communication include mention of similar clinical material a borderline schizophrenic young man tell i that to he the various theoretical concept about which he have be expound in a most articulate fashion during session after session with i be like great cube of almost tangibly solid matter up in the air above he a he speak i be remind of the great bale of cargo which be swing high in the air from a dock steamship
