martin feel it be incredible that the situation have come to exist at all and once begin have grow to such monstrous proportion the pair of white cotton shorts rule he life lie awake at night he could see they lay out on the floor of he mind when he rise in the morning the image be still there he have always be a messy and negligent man in he bachelor day he bedroom have be strew with clothe which he mother or late the hotel maid generally see fit to put in order no doubt dolore resent follow in they footstep but it be fun those first day kid about the trail of garment he leave litter across the rug there be an assertive maleness in he grin refusal to pick they up half slyly he enjoy see she stoop to lift the thing he remember the first time he see she stand across the room at a party the smooth curve of she neck very white against hair which curl against it like petal she hair be the color of those bloom which in seed catalogue be refer to a black but since no flower be actually without color contain always a hint of grape or purple or blue he want to draw the broad patina of hair through he finger search it slowly for a trace of vein which might reveal it true shade beneath the darkness so he seek she out and speak to she and think of he hand in she hair or against she back press on the column of vertebra which hold she so magnificently straight and unyielding until the segment of bone make tiny sharp crack noise like the snap stem of a tulip but to put it bluntly nothing snap yet that have not seriously trouble he not then they marry more he could take at leisure all martin think he need be time to what good use could time be put he see late that they have make they marriage too quickly there be too little occasion beforehand for resistance the brave strong delight of emotional clash and meet they have leave themselves too much to discover but at the start he new life feel invigorating good it be on the tenth day after the wedding how could it have be so soon that he drop the shorts on the floor now i m not go to pick up those shorts martin give she a tease pat i think you ll get tire of they there in the morning the shorts be where he have leave they he smile to himself and decide not to mention they till dolore do it be almost too easy for he have just remember tonight they be have they first guest the shorts would not be on the floor when he come home that even he be wrong the rest of the bedroom have be groom to a superhuman neatness but in the middle of the carpet lie the disheveled shorts they give the room a strange note of incongruity like a mole on a beautiful face he see that dolore intend to wait until the last minute think he would get nervous quietly he determine to foil she i can be a stubborn a she can he think i nerve be a strong she ll rush to the bedroom when the doorbell ring it ring ten minute early martin be stand a few foot from the front door he swing around eye toward the bedroom some fifteen foot away dolore stand motionless in the doorway he could not cross the live room brush past she and bend down to retrieve the shorts martin turn he back he stride to answer the bell bill s hat be deposit in the hall closet with the most casual and relax manner in the world dolore lead anthea to the bedroom martin strain he ear at first he could not be sure then he catch just enough to know that the shorts be still there a glissade of giggle slide over they voice all even anthea favore he with odd coy look clearly she have be instruct not to say a word for some reason this ellipsis in the conversation spread until it swallow up every other topic at last there be a void no one could fill the brainards go home early martin realize late on that he should have have it out with dolore that night a violently a possible but he be so take aback he could not believe any rage of he would make she give in on the contrary it would only weaken he position if he fume while she stay calm and adamant and if he surrender after rave at she he shiver suppose he run up the white flag altogether at once he consider the sober possibility in he head be the echo of those titter with anthea there be something about private feminine whispering which always make he feel scabrous and unclean he remember he mother gossip with she neighborhood woman friend lower she voice to a penetrate hoarseness which might be trust to carry to the head of the stairs where he crouch listen he could even recall the last time he sit there she be talk about he that time because he have do some bad thing something she dislike but afterwards martin say he be sorry he apologize so sweetly i could nt keep be annoy with he it be nt even true that he d say he be sorry that time he have in fact say simply that he wish the thing have nt happen which be a honest a he could put it but he mother tell the story over and over till she martin say he be sorry be a much a part of she a the shape of she thin pallid ear the battle have to be fight let the good sex win but he resolution hardly seem to help if the situation have be bad it now get bad about this time people begin drop in consider that the newly marry have be leave alone long enough angrily martin wish they have delay the wedding and go on a trip preferably one that last month instead of decide not to postpone the date until he could get away here they be at the mercy of anyone who choose to come by these stray people nearly always insist on dolore show they around the apartment of course the tour of inspection include the ever-present shorts it be curious how the different visitor take this some try to ignore the blot on the bedroom s countenance other ask quite a few laugh to they all dolore tell a lightheart and witty tale it s a little contest martin and i have she would begin gaily carry the anecdote through a frothy and deceptive course while he wait in the live room once martin go along they enter the bedroom and dolore say nothing then one of the guest show he merriment you be in a hurry be nt you martin would have like to break the man s neck dolore smile she let the interpretation stand now martin hear himself give a snort of mock good nature with she eye dolore dare he for the truth ready to begin it s a little contest never again do he enter into the ritual of show the apartment they keep up a rigid pretense of speak relation but martin seldom feel the impulse to talk about anything what to talk about dolore keep pick up any of he clothe except the fatal shorts which he leave about but he have be rob of pleasure in scatter he possession he fall into the habit of put he clothe in drawer and closet so he life might impinge a little a possible on hers the shorts alone remain in he moment of bad agony martin imagine what he friend be say the sound of they amazement bizarre he could hear the word the most bizarre situation we be up to visit they and he have think she exactly what he want six week of marriage and i m use the past tense he tell himself furiously pursue he idea he see that it would be impossible to leave she now everyone would know why he would cut a supremely ridiculous figure he be trap day and night martin could not drag he mind from the dilemma he have make for himself he mind scurry frantically seek an exit alternately he have period of hostile defeatism in which he determine sullenly morosely to live out he life in this fashion nothing would change nothing would ever change when the solution finally come to he one night while he be in bed he be so shake by it simplicity that he could only wonder why it have not occur to he before in a frenzy of excitement he consider he plan beside he shorts he would place something of hers instantaneously he would have win an immeasurable moral victory for if she pick up say a pair of she panty she might just a well lift he shorts lie alongside the expenditure of energy be almost the same he feel that it would be a particular humiliation to dolore to pick up she own underwear which he have lay on the floor furthermore he could go on repeat the maneuver endlessly every time he go in the bedroom he could drop a slip or a brassiere or maybe a girdle next to he shorts sooner or late dolore would crack on the other hand if she do nt remove she own thing it would be difficult to explain to the parade of guest which traverse the apartment martin guess that dolore would not be so eager to tell the next installment of she story the tale he think would become less gay she have use he rumple shorts a the very image of he childishness he lack of control he general male looseness while she remain cool airy and untouched the charm teacher who discipline an unruly body to have she underclothes link with he on the floor would draw she visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd something in the back of he mind be aware that the magnificence of the plan lie in he faith that the idea would work because he believe in it since he courage and virility be involve because it be truly he the knowledge keep he from analyze he scheme to death and take he through the last hour of that night in a peace of exalt fanaticism the next morning while dolore be out of the room he go to she bureau drawer take out a pair of nylon lace pants and tenderly drop they next to he shorts he sit down on the bed in a surprisingly short time dolore appear to he delight she eye focus at once upon the two garment slowly and deliberately she reach down and touch the lace with she finger then hesitate for about a second ah he think she s go through the chain of reason which say she might really just a well pick up i shorts too he see that in a moment she have grasp all the implication of a plot which have be week in occur to he extend she finger another inch she catch up the shorts and swiftly leave the room she do not look at he but he notice that she face be flush and she eye unsteady they breakfast together but martin do not refer to he triumph and dolore find a great deal to do in the kitchen bob up and down from the table so that talk be impossible well martin think that ll save he leave for work in high spirit a he relax that day martin realize how tense he have be these past week he find that he no long hate dolore he know how much he have hate she and he be surprise at a resurgence of an affectionate feel
