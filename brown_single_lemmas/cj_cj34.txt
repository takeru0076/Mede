it be obvious enough that linguist in general have be less successful in cope with tone system than with consonant or vowel no single explanation be adequate to account for this improvement however be urgent and at least three thing will be need the first be a wide-ranging sample of successful tonal analysis even begin student in linguistics be make familiar with an appreciable variety of consonant system both in they general outline and in many specific detail an advance student have read a considerable number of description of consonantal system include some of the more unusual type by contrast even experience linguist commonly know no more of the range of possibility in tone system than the over-simple distinction between register and contour language this limit familiarity with the possible phenomenon have severely hamper work with tone tone analysis will continue to be difficult and unsatisfactory until a more representative selection of system be familar to every practice field linguist paper like these four if widely read will contribute importantly to improvement of we analytic work the second need be good field technique the great majority of present-day linguist fall into one or more of a number of overlap type those who be convince that tone can not be analyse those who be personally scare of tone and tone language generally those who be convince that tone be merely an unnecessary marginal feature in those language where it occur those who have no idea how to proceed with tone analysis those who take a simplistic view of the whole matter the result have be neglect fumble effort or superficial treatment a these malady overlap so must the cure analysis such a these four will simultaneously combat the assumption that tone be impossible and that it be simple they will give suggestion that can be work up into field procedure good field technique will not only equip linguist for good work but also help they overcome negative attitude actually none of these paper say much directly about field technique but it be worth ponder that very little have be publish on any phase of field technique in linguistics these thing have be disseminate by other mean but always in the wake of extensive publication of analytic result the third need be for good theory we should expect that general phonologic theory should be a adequate for tone a for consonant and vowel but it have not be this can only be for one of two reason either the two be quite different and will require totally different theory and hence technique or we exist theory be insufficiently general if a i suspect the problem be largely of the second sort then development of a theory good able to handle tone will result automatically in good theory for all phonologic subsystem one issue that must be face be the relative difficulty of analysis of different phonologic subsystem since tone system typically comprise fewer unit than either consonant or vowel system we might expect that they would be the easy part of a phonologic analysis actual practice do not often work out this way tone system be certainly more complex than the number of unit would suggest and often analytically more difficult than much large consonantal system welmers have suggest one explanation tone language use for linguistic contrast speech parameter which also function heavily in nonlinguistic use this may both divert the attention of the uninitiate and cause confusion for the more knowledgeable the problem be to disentangle the linguistic feature of pitch from the co-occur nonlinguistic feature of course something of the same sort occur with other sector of the phonology consonantal articulation have both a linguistic and an individual component but in general the individual variation be a small thing add onto basic linguistic feature of great magnitude with tone individual difference may be great than the linguistic contrast which be superimpose on they pitch difference from one speaker to another or from one emotional state to another may far exceed the small difference between tone however any such suggestion account for only some of the difficulty in hear tone or in develop a realistic attitude about tone but not for the analytic difficulty that occur even when tone be meticulously record a second explanation be suggest by the material describe in rowlands paper tone and intonation often become seriously intermesh neither can be adequately systematize until we be able to separate the two and assign the observe phenomenon individually to one or the other other pair of phonologic subsystem also interact or overlap in this way for example duration sometimes figure in both the vowel system and the intonation some phonetic feature for example glottal catch or murmur be sometimes to be assign to segmental phonemics and sometimes to accentual system but no other two phonologic system be a difficult to disentangle a be tone and intonation in some language this explanation of tone difficulty however do not apply in all language in some the ewe type mention above interaction of tone and intonation be restrict to the end of intonation span in many of the syllable intonation can be safely ignore and much of the tonal analysis can be do without any study of intonation still even in such language tone analysis have not be a simple a one might expect a third explanation be suggest by richardson s analysis of sukuma tone there we see a basically simple phonemic system enmesh in a very complex and puzzle morphophonemic system while the phoneme can be very easily state no one be likely to be satisfy with the statement until phonemic occurrence can be relate in some way to morphemic unit ie until the morphophonemics be work out or at least far enough that it seem reasonable to expect success in the typical tone language tonal morphophonemics be of the same order of complexity a consonantal morphophonemics the phonemic system which must support these morphophonemic system however be very different the inventory of tone be much small and commonly the contrast range along one single dimension pitch level consonantal system be not merely large they be multidimensional morphophonemic rule may be think of a join certain point in the system the possibility in the consonantal system be very numerous and only a small portion of they be actually use phoneme connect by a morphophonemic rule commonly show a good bit of phonetic similarity possible because of the several dimension of contrast in the system tonal morphophonemics in a common case can do nothing but either raise or low the tone the possibility be few and the total number of rule may be considerably great often therefore there be a number of rule have the same effect and commonly other set of rule a well have the opposite effect tonal morphophonemics be much more confuse to the begin analyst than consonantal morphophonemics even when the total number of rule be no great the difficulty of analysis of any subsystem in the phonology be an inverse function of the size small system be more troublesome for any give degree of morphophonemic complexity this hypothesis will account for a large part of the difficulty of tonal analysis a well a the fact that vowel system be often more puzzle than consonantal system the statement of the system be a different matter small system can of course be state much more succinctly a phonemic system can be state without reference to morphophonemics but it can not always be find without morphophonemics and the more complex the morphophonemic system be in relation to the phonemic base the less easily a phonemic system will be analyse without close attention to the morphophonemics at least the less satisfy will a phonemic statement be if it can not be relate through morphophonemic rule to grammatically meaningful structure the design of orthography have receive much less attention from linguist than the problem deserve there have be a tendency on the part of many american linguist to assume that a phonemic transcription will automatically be the good possible orthography and that the only real problem will then be the social one of secure acceptance this seem naive most other have be content to give only the most general attention to the broad and most obvious feature of the phonology when design orthography apparently the feel be that anything more would be involvement in technical abstrusenesses of possible pedantic interest but of no visible significance in practical affair the result of this attitude have be the domination of many orthography conference by such consideration a typographic esthetics which usually turn out to be nothing more than certain prejudice carry over from european language many of the suggest system seem to have only the most tenuous relationship to the language structure that they purport to represent linguist have not always be more enlighten than practical people and sometimes have insist on incredibly trivial point while neglect thing of much great significance a a result many people have be confirm in they conviction that orthography design be not an activity to which expert can contribute anything but confusion ae sharp in vowel-length and syllabicity in kikuyu examine one set of relate orthographic question and it phonologic background in detail he objective be merely to determine what distinction of length and syllabicity it may be desirable to make explicit in a kikuyu orthography 59 to do so he find it necessary to examine the relevant part of the phonology thoroughly and in detail in the process he develop some very significant observation about problem of a sort that be often difficult a few of he example be of very great interest and the whole discussion of some importance for theory he orthographic recommendation be no simplistic acceptance of phonemics on the one hand or of superficiality on the other rather he weigh each phonologic fact in the light of it orthographic usefulness he conclude that some change can be make in the current orthography which will appreciably improve it usefulness but hesitate to suggest precise graphic device to effect these change i hope he suggestion be give the consideration they deserve in kikuyu circle this however will not exhaust they practical usefulness a they rather clearly indicate what thorough phonologic investigation can contribute to orthography design we need many more study of this sort if the design of write language be to be put on a sound basis one other paper deal with a phonologic problem vowel harmony in igbo by j carnochan this restate the already widely know fact in term of prosody a a restatement it make only a small contribution to knowledge of igbo but it would seem more intend a a tract advocate the prosodic theory than a paper direct to the specific problem of igbo phonology the paper have a certain value a a comparatively easy introduction to this approach particularly since it treat a fairly simple and straightforward phenomenon where it be possible to compare it with a more traditional though not structural statement it do show one feature of the system that have not be previously describe but it do not a it claim demonstrate that this could not be treat by traditional method it seem to i that it rather easily can five of the paper deal with grammatical problem on the whole they maintain much the same high standard but they be much more difficult to discuss in detail because of they wide variety of subject matter i comment must be brief than the paper deserve wh whiteley write on the verbal radical in iraqw this must be consider primarily an amendment and supplement to he early a short description of item-categories in iraqw it exhibit much the same descriptive technique and be open to much the same criticism the treatment seem unnecessarily loose-jointed and complex largely because the method be lax and the analysis seem never to be push to a satisfactory or even a consistent stopping-point
