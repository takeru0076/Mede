if the content of faith be to be present today in a form that can be understanded of the people and this it must not be forget be one of the goal of the perennial theological task there be no other choice but to abandon completely a mythological manner of representation this do not mean that mythological language a such can no long be use in theology and preach the absurd notion that demythologization entail the expurgation of all mythological concept completely misrepresent bultmann s intention he point be not that mythology may not be use but that it may no long be regard a the only or even the most appropriate conceptuality for express the christian kerygma when we say that a mythological mode of think must be completely abandon we mean it must be abandon a the sole or proper mean for present the christian understand of existence mythological concept may by all mean still be use but they can be use responsibly only a symbol or cipher that be only if they be also constantly interpret in nonmythological or existential term the statement be often make that when bultmann argue in this way he overestimate the intellectual stumbling-block which myth be suppose to put in the way of accept the christian faith but this statement be completely unconvincing if bultmann s own definition of myth be strictly adhere to and it be interest that this be almost never do by those who make such pronouncement the evidence be overwhelming that he do not at all exaggerate the extent to which the mythological concept of traditional theology have become incredible and irrelevant nor be it necessary to look for such evidence in the great urban center of we culture that be admittedly almost entirely secularize and so profoundly estranged from the conventional form in which the gospel have be communicate on the contrary even in the heart of the bible belt itself a can be attest by any one who be call to work there the industrial and technological revolution have long be under way together with the correspond change in man s picture of himself and he world in fact it be in just such a situation that the profundity of bultmann s argument be disclose although the theological form of the past continue to exist in a way they do not in a more secularize situation the strike thing be the rapidity with which they be be reduce to a marginal existence this be especially in evidence among the present generation of the suburban middle class time and again in counseling and teach one encounter member of this group whose attempt to bring into some kind of unity the insubstantial mythology of they fundamentalist heritage and the stubborn reality of the modern world be only too painfully obvious the same thing be also evidence by the extreme culture-protestantism so often observe to characterize the preach and teach of the american church in the absence of a truly adequate conceptuality in which the gospel can be express the unavoidable need to demythologize it make use of whatever resource be at hand and this usually mean one or another of the various form of folk religion current in the situation this be not to say that the only explanation of the present infatuation with norman vincent peale s cult of reassurance or the other type of a purely cultural christianity be the ever-present need for a demythologize gospel but it be to say that this need be far more important for such infatuation than most of the pundit seem to have suspect however even if the latent demand for demythologization be not nearly a widespread a we be claim at least among the culture element of the population there tend to be an almost complete indifference to the church and it traditional message of sin and grace to be sure when this be point out a common response among certain churchman be to fulminate about the little flock and the great crowd and to take solace from paul s castigation of the wisdom of the wise in the open chapter of first corinthian but can we any long afford the luxury of such smug indigation can the church risk assume that the folly of man be a dear to god a they wisdom or a be also commonly imply that the foolishness of god and the foolishness of man be simply two way of talk about the same thing can we continue to alienate precisely those whose gift we so desperately need and apart from whose co-operation we mission in the world must become increasingly precarious there be an ancient and venerable tradition in the church which derive however from the heritage of the greek rather than from the bible that god be completely independent of he creation and so have no need of man for accomplish he work in the world by analogy the church also have be regard a entirely independent of the world in the sense of require nothing from it in order to be the church but a scripture everywhere remind we god do have need of he creature and the church a fortiori can ill afford to do without the talent with which the world by god s providence present it and yet this be exactly the risk we run when we assume a we too often do that we can continue to preach the gospel in a form that make it seem incredible and irrelevant to culture man until we translate this gospel into a language that enlighten man today can understand we be deprive ourselves of the very resource on which the continue success of we witness most certainly depend in argue in this way we be obviously take for grant that a demythologize restatement of the kerygma can be achieve and that we firmly believe this will presently become evident when we set forth reason to justify such a conviction but the main point here be that even if such a restatement be not possible the demand to demythologize the kerygma would still be unavoidable this be what we mean when we say this demand must be accept without condition if to be a christian mean to say yes where i otherwise say no or where i do not have the right to say anything at all then i only choice be to refuse to be a christian express differently if the price for become a faithful follower of jesus christ be some form of self-destruction whether of the body or of the mind sacrificium corporis sacrificium intellectus then there be no alternative but that the price remain unpaid this must be stress because it be absolutely essential to the argument of this conclude chapter modern man a dietrich bonhoeffer have tell we have come of age and though this process by no mean represent an unambiguous gain and be in fact mark by the estrangement from the depth that seem to be the cost of human maturation it be still a positive step forward and those of we who so richly benefit from it should be the last to despise it in any event it be an irreversible step and if we be at all honest with ourselves we will know we have no other alternative than to live in the world in which god have see fit to place we to say this of course be to take up a position on one side of a controversy go on now for some two hundred year or at any rate since the begin of the distinctively modern period in theological think we have align ourselves with that liberal tradition in protestant christianity that count among the great name in it history those of schleiermacher ritschl herrmann harnack and troeltsch and more recently schweitzer and the early barth and in part at least bultmann it be to this same tradition that most of the creative figure in the last century and a half of american theology also belong for we must number here not only the name of bushnell clarke and rauschenbusch not to mention those of the chicago school and macintosh but those of the brother niebuhr and if america may claim he tillich a well finally we may also mention the several member of the self-consciously neoliberal movement that develop at the university of chicago and be heavily indebted philosophically to the creative work of alfred north whitehead what make this long and diverse tradition essentially one be that those who have belong to it have be profoundly in earnest about be modern man in a distinctively modern world although they have also be concern to stand squarely within the tradition of the apostolic church they have } exhibit no willingness whatever to sacrifice they modernity to they christianity they have insist rather on live fully and completely within modern culture and so far from consider this treason to god have look upon it a the only way they could be faithful to he when we say then that today in we situation the demand for demythologization must be accept without condition we be simply say that at least this much of the liberal tradition be an endure achievement however much we may have to criticize liberal theology s constructive formulation the theology we ourselves must strive to formulate can only go beyond liberalism not behind it in affirm this we have already take the decisive step in break the deadlock into which bultmann s attempt to formulate such a theology have lead for we have say in effect that of the two alternative to he position variously represent by the other participant in the demythologize discussion only one be really an alternative if the demand for demythologization be unavoidable and so must be accept by theology unconditionally the position of the right be clearly untenable whereas bultmann s center position be structurally inconsistent and be therefore indefensible on formal ground alone the general position of the right a represent say by karl barth involve the rejection or at least qualification of the demand for demythologization and so be invalidate on the material ground we have just consider it follow then provide the possibility have be exhaust that the only real alternative be the general viewpoint of the leave which have be represent on the continent by fritz buri and to some extent at least be find in much that be significant in american and english theology in order to make the implication of we position a clear a possible we may develop this argument at great length we may show first that there can not possibly be an alternative other than the three typically represent by bultmann barth and buri to do this it be sufficient to point out that if the principle in term of which alternative be to be conceive be such a to exclude more than two then the question of a third possibility be a meaningless question thus if what be at issue be whether all s be p it be indifferent whether some s be not p or no s be p since in either case the judgment in question be false hence if what be in question be whether in a give theology myth be or be not completely reject it be unimportant whether only a little bit of myth or a considerable quantity be accept for in either event the first possibility be exclude therefore the only conceivable alternative be those represent on the one hand by the two at least apparently self-consistent but mutually exclusive position of buri and barth and on the other hand by the third but really pseudo position analogous to a round square of bultmann a second point require more extend comment it will be recall from the discussion in section 7 that the position of the right a represent by barth rest on the follow thesis the only tenable alternative to bultmann s position be a theology that 1 reject or at least qualify he unconditioned demand for demythologization and existential interpretation 2 accept instead a special biblical hermeneutic or method of interpretation and 3 in so do free itself to give appropriate emphasis to the event jesus christ by mean of statement that from bultmann s point of view be mythological
