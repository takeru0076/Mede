criticism be a old a literary art and we can set the stage for we study of three modern if we see how certain critic in the past have deal with the ethical aspect of literature i have choose five contrast pair ten man in all and they be arrange in roughly chronological order such a list must naturally be selective and the treatment of each man be brief for i be interest only in they general idea on the moral measure of literature altogether the list will give we considerable variety in attitude and some typical one for these critic range all the way from censor to those who consider art above ethics all the way from plato to poe and most of the great period be represent because we will compare plato and aristotle from the golden age of greece stephen gosson and sir philip sidney from renaissance england dr johnson and william hazlitt of the eighteenth and early nineteenth century in england and jame russell lowell and edgar allan poe of nineteenth century american letter plato and aristotle plato and aristotle agree on some vital literary issue they both measure literature by moral standard and in they political writing both allow for censorship but the difference between they be also significant while aristotle censor literature only for the young plato would banish all poet from he ideal state even more important in he poetic aristotle differ somewhat from plato when he move in the direction of treat literature a a unique thing separate and apart from it cause and it effect all through the republic plato attend to the way art relate to the general life and ultimately to a good life for he citizen in short he be constantly concern with the ethical effect when he discuss the subject matter of poetry he ask what moral effect the scene will have when he turn briefly to literary style in the third book he again look to the effect on the audience he explain that he citizen must not be corrupt by any of the misrepresentation of the god or hero that one find in much poetry and he observe that all these pantomimic gentleman will be send to another state only those story teller will remain who can imitate the style of the virtuous plato be at time just a suspicious of the poet themselves a he be of they work when he discuss tyrant in the eighth book of the republic he picture the poet a will to praise the bad ruler but the most fundamental objection he have to poet appear in the tenth book and it be derive from he doctrine of ideal form in plato s mind there be an irresolvable conflict between the poet and the philosopher because the poet imitate only particular object and be incapable of rise to the first level of abstraction much less the high level of ideal form true reality of course be the ideal and the poet know nothing of this only the philosopher know the truth poet moreover dwell on human passion and with this point about the passion we encounter plato s dualism the same sort of think play so large a part in both babbitt and more that we must examine it in some detail plato feel that man have two compete aspect he rational faculty and he irrational we can be virtuous only if we control we low nature the passion in this case and strengthen we rational side and poetry with all it emphasis on the passion encourage the audience to give way to emotion for this reason then poetry tend to weaken the power of control the reason because it tempt one to indulge he passion and even the good of man he maintain may be corrupt by this subtle influence plato s attitude toward poetry have always be something of an enigma because he be so completely sensitive to it charm he whole objection indeed seem to rise out of a deep conviction that the poet do have great power to influence but plato seldom pay any attention to what might be call the poem itself he be rather concern with the effect on society and he want the poet to join he fight for justice he want they to use they great power to strengthen man s rational side to teach virtue and to encourage religion while plato finally allow a few acceptable hymn to the god and famous man still he clearly leave the way open for far discussion of the issue he even call upon the poet to defend the muse and to show that poetry may contribute to virtue he say we may far grant to those of she poetry s defender who be lover of poetry and yet not poet the permission to speak in prose on she behalf let they show not only that she be pleasant but also useful to state and to human life and we will listen in a kindly spirit for if this can be prove we shall surely be the gainer i mean if there be a use in poetry a well a a delight when we turn to aristotle s idea on the moral measure of literature it be at once apparent that he be at time equally concern about the influence of the art in the ideal state for instance he argue that the young citizen should hear only the most carefully select tale and story for this reason he would banish indecent picture and speech from the stage and the young people should not even be permit to see comedy till they be old enough to drink strong wine and sit at the public table by the time they reach that age however aristotle no long worry about the evil influence of comedy in aristotle s analysis of tragedy in the poetic we find an attempt to isolate the art to consider only those thing proper to it to discover how it differ from other art and to deal with the effect peculiar to it he assure we early in the poetic that all art be imitation and that all imitation give pleasure but he distinguish between art in general and poetic art on the basis of the mean manner and the object of the imitation once the poetic art be separate from the other form he lay down he famous definition of tragedy which set up standard and so lend direction to the remainder of the work a tragedy by he definition be an imitation of an action that be serious of a certain magnitude and complete in itself it should have a dramatic form with please language and it should portray incident which so arouse pity and fear that it purge these emotion in the audience any tragedy he maintain have six element plot character and think the object of imitation diction and melody the mean of imitation and spectacle the manner of imitation throughout the rest of the poetic aristotle continue to discuss the characteristic of these six part and they interrelationship and he refer frequently to the standard suggest by he definition of tragedy aristotle s method in the poetic then do suggest that we should isolate the work the chicago contingent of modern critic follow aristotle so far in this direction that it be hard to see how they can compare one poem with another for the purpose of evaluation but there be however several feature of aristotle s approach which open the way for the moral measure of literature for one thing aristotle mention that play may corrupt the audience in addition he definition of a tragedy invite we attention because a serious and important action may very well be one that test the moral fiber of the author or of the character and there be one other point in the poetic that invite moral evaluation aristotle s notion that the distinctive function of tragedy be to purge one s emotion by arouse pity and fear he reject certain plot because they do not contribute to that end the point be that an ethical critic with an assist from freud can seize on this theory to argue that tragedy provide we with a harmless outlet for we hostile urge in he study samuel johnson joseph wood krutch take this line when he say that what aristotle really mean by he theory of catharsis be that we evil passion may be so purge by the dramatic ritual that it be less likely that we shall indulge they through we own act in krutch s view this be one way to show how literature may be moral in effect without employ the explicit method of a moralist and we can add that krutch s interpretation of purgation be also one answer to plato s fear that poetry will encourage we passion if krutch be correct tragedy may have quite the opposite effect it may allay we passion and so restore the rule of reason or in more freudian term the experience may serve to sublimate we destructive urge and strengthen the ego and superego gosson and sidney the second half of the sixteenth century in england be the set for a violent and long controversy over the moral quality of renaissance literature especially the drama no one suggest that the ethical effect of the art be irrelevant both side agree that the theater must stand a moral test but they could not agree on whether the poet be a good or a bad influence both side claim that plato and aristotle support they cause those who want to close the theaters for example point to plato s republic and those who wish to keep they open call on the plato of the ion to testify in they behalf the most famous document that come out of this dispute be perhaps sir philip sidney s an apologie for poetrie publish in 1595 many student of literature know that classical defense what be not so well know however and what be quite important for understand the issue of this early quarrel be the kind of attack on literature that sidney be answer for this reason then i want to describe first two example of the puritanical attack stephen gosson s the school of abuse 1579 and he late playe confute publish in 1582 second we will see how sidney answer the charge for while sidney s essay be not specifically a reply to gosson he argument do support the new theater accord to william ringler s study stephen gosson the theater business in london have become a thrive enterprise by 1577 and in the opinion of many a thoroughly bad business arouse by what they consider an evil influence some member of the clergy join by city authority merchant and master craftsman begin the attack on the play and the actor for what they call the abuse of the art but by 1582 some of they begin to denounce the whole idea of act although this kind of wholesale objection come at first from some man who be not technically puritan still once the puritan gain power they climax the affair by pass the infamous ordinance of 1642 which decree that all public stage-play shall cease and be forborne with that act of parliament the opponent of the stage win the day and for more than two decade after that england have no legitimate public drama in the early day of this controversy over the theater one of the interest party stephen gosson publish a little tract in which he object mildly to the abuse of art rather than the art itself but he opposition harden and by 1579 in the school of abuse he be ready to banish all player he advise woman to beware of those place which in sorrow cheere you and beguile you in mirth he do not really approve of levity and laughter but sex be the deadly sin he warn that a single glance can lead we into temptation for look eie have
