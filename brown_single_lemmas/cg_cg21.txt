american democratic think point up the relation between the protestant movement in this country and the development of a social religion which he call the american democratic faith those familiar with he work will remember that he place the incipience of the democratic faith at around 1850 and he describe it a a balance polarity between the notion of the free individual and what he call the fundamental law i want to say more about gabriel s so-called fundamental law but first i want to quote he on the relationship that he find between religion and politics in this country and what happen to it he point out that from the time of jackson on through world war 1 evangelical protestantism be a dominant influence in the social and political life of america he term this early enthusiasm romantic christianity and conclude that it similarity to democratic belief of that day be so great that the doctrine of liberty seem but a secular version of it counterpart in evangelical protestantism let i quote he even more fully for he analysis be important to i theme he say beside the protestant philosophy of progress a express in radical or conservative millenarianism should be place the doctrine of the democratic faith which affirm it to be the duty of the destiny of the unite state to assist in the creation of a good world by keep light the beacon of democracy he specify in the middle period of the nineteenth century it be colore by christian supernaturalism in the twentieth century it be affect by naturalism but in every period it have be humanism and let i add utopianism also some fourteen or fifteen year ago in an essay i call the leader follow where i use he polarity to illustrate what i think have happen to we in that form of liberalism we call progressivism it seem to i that the liberal have scrap the balance polarity and repose both liberty and the fundamental law in the common man that be to say gabriel s fundamental law have be so much modify by this time that it be neither fundamental nor law any more it be a weakness of gabriel s analysis that he never seem to realize that he so-called fundamental law have already be cut loose from it foundation when it be adapt to democracy and with progressivism the religion of humanity be replace what gabriel call christian supernaturalism and the common man be develop mythic power or charisma on he own during the decade that follow the common man a that piece put it grow uncomfortable a the voice of god and flee from behind saint woodrow wilson only to learn from science to he shock relief that after all there be no god he have to speak for and that he be just an animal anyhow that there be a chemical formula for he and that too much could nt be expect of he the socialism implicit in the slogan of the roosevelt revolution freedom from want and fear seem a far cry from the individualism of the first amendment to the constitution or of the jacksonian frontier what have happen to the common man french egalitarianism have have only nominal influence in this country before the day of popularism the riotous onrush of industrialism after the war for southern independence and the general secular drift to the religion of humanity however prepare the way for a reception of the french revolution s socialistic offspring of one sort of another the first of which to find important place in we federal government be the graduate income tax under wilson moreover the centralization of we economy during the 1920s the dislocation of the depression the common ethos of materialism everywhere all contribute in various way to the face-lifting that replace mike fink and the great gatsby with the anonymous physiognomy of the little people however it be important to trace the philosophy of the french revolution to it source to understand the common democratic origin of individualism and socialism and the influence of the latter on the former that john locke s philosophy of the social contract father the american revolution with it declaration of independence i believe we generally accept yet after rousseau have give the social contract a new twist with he notion of the general will the same philosophy it may be say become the idea source of the french revolution also the importance of rousseau s twist have not always be clear to we however this notion of the general will give rise to the commune of paris in the revolution and late bring napoleon to dictatorship and it be clearly argue by lord percy of newcastle in he remarkable long essay the heresy of democracy and in a more general way by voegelin in he new science of politics that this same rousseauan idea descend through european democracy be the source of marx s theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat this be important to understand the position that doctrinaire liberal find themselves in after world war 2 and we great democratic victory that bring no peace the long road that have take liberal in this country into the social religion of democracy into a worship of man lead logically to the marxist dream of a classless society under a socialist state and the ussr exist a the revolutionary experiment in radical socialism the ultimate exemplar and by the time the war end liberal leadership in this country be spiritually marxist we will recall that the still confident liberal of the truman administration gather with other western utopian in san francisco to set up the legal framework finally and at last to rationalize war to rationalize want and fear out of the world the unite nation we of the liberal-led world get all set for peace and rehabilitation then suddenly we find ourselves in the middle of another fight an irrational an indecent an undeclared and immoral war with we strong and some have think nobl ally during the next five year the leader of the fair deal reluctantly back down from the optimistic expectation of the new deal during the next five year liberal leader in the unite state sink in the cumulative confusion attendant upon and manifest in a negative policy of containment and the bittere irony enforce and enforceable only by threat of a weapon that we feel the great distaste for but could not abandon the atom bomb in 1952 it will be remember the gop without positive program campaign on the popular disillusionment with liberal leadership and win overwhelmingly all of this i know be recent history familiar to you but i have be at some pain to review it a the drama of the common man to point up what happen to he under eisenhower s leadership a perceptive journalist sam lubell have phrase it in the title of one of he book a the revolt of the moderate he open he discourse however with a review of the eisenhower inaugural festivity at which a sympathetic press have assemble it massive talent all prime to catch some revelation of the emerge new age the show be colorful indeed exuberant but the press for all it assiduity could detect no note of a fateful rendezvous with destiny lubell offer he book a an explanation of why there be no clue and i select this sentence a it pertinent summation in essence the drama of he eisenhower s presidency can be describe a the ordeal of a nation turn conservative and struggle thus far with but limit and precarious success to give effective voice and force to that conservatism i will assume that we be all aware of the continue struggle with it limit and precarious success toward conservatism it have move on various level it have be clamorous and confuse obviously there have be no agreement on what american conservatism be or rather what it should be for it be neglect not to say nascent when the struggle begin i see a piece the other day assail william buckley author of man and god at yale and publisher of the national review a no conservative at all but an old liberal i would agree with this view but i m not here to define conservatism what i be here to do be to report on the gyration of the struggle a struggle that amount to self-redefinition to see if we can predict it future course one of the obvious conclusion we can make on the basis of the last election i suppose be that we the majority be dissatisfied with eisenhower conservatism though to be sure we give kennedy no very positive approval in the margin of he preferment this be however symptomatic of we national malaise but before i try to diagnose it i would offer other evidence i will mention two volume of specific comment on this malaise that appear last year the early of they be an unofficial enterprise sponsor by life magazine under the title of the national purpose the contributor to this testament be all well-known a former democratic candidate for president a new deal poet the magazine s chief editorial writer two newspaper columnist head of a national broadcast company a popular protestant evangelist etc what i want to point out here be that all of they be ex-liberal or modify liberal with perhaps one exception i suppose we might classify billy graham a an old liberal and i would far note that they all with one exception again sing in one key or another the same song it refrain be let we return to the individualistic democracy of we forefather for we salvation adlai stevenson express some reservation about this return other invoke technology and common sense only walter lippman envision the possibility of we have outlive most of what we use to regard a the program of we national purpose but the most notable thing about the incantation of these ex-liberal be that the one-time shibboleth of socialism be conspicuously absent the second specific comment be the report of eisenhower s commission on national goal title goal for american they perhaps give the pitch of they position in the preface where it be say that eisenhower request that the commission be administer by the american assembly of columbia university because it be non-partisan the commission seem to represent the viewpoint of what i would call the unconscious liberal but not unconscious enough to invoke the now taboo symbolism of socialism and here again we hear the same refrain mention above the paramount goal of the unite state set long ago be to guard the right of the individual ensure he development enlarge he opportunity this group be secularist and they program tend to be technological but it be the need to undertake these testament that i would submit here a symptom of the common man s malaise and let i add murray s new book a another symptom of it particularly so in view of the attention time magazine give it when it come out recently father murray go back to the declaration of independence too though i may add with considerably more historical perception i will reserve discussion of it for a moment however to return to president kennedy a symptomatic of the common man s malaise he be most significant a liberal and a catholic elect by the skin of he tooth do that not suggest to you an uncertain and uneasy not to say confuse state of the public mind what be the common man s complaint let s take a panoramic look back over the course we have come have not that way be light always by the lamp of liberalism up until the turn back under eisenhower and the basic character of that liberalism have be spiritual rather than economic ralph gabriel give it the name of protestant philosophy of progress but there s a subjective side to that utopian outlook
