temperature of the wash and rinse water be maintain at 85 - 90-degrees-f 29 - 32-degrees-c the top roll be load with 40 lb sixty lb load be possible but 40 lb be adequate the sud box drain be arrange at the start to deliver into the raise main drain pipe thus return sud to soap box and the machine be start the 160-ml bath contain the calculate amount of detergent be apply slowly and directly to the run specimen wash be continue for 30 minute or for a period of time sufficient to allow 100 nip or pass through the squeeze roll at the conclusion of the wash 8 liters of water at 90-degrees-f 32 \* 0c be automatically meter from the rinse reservoir to the wash tub 4 liters to each tub this operation require from 10 to 12 minute during the rinse operation the volume in the tub gradually increase until overflow from the main drain begin at this point the drain be readjust so that the sud box drain will discharge directly into the waste line and the main tub drain be set at the 2-12 mark on the drain gauge when all of the rinse water have pass from the reservoir to the tub the main drain be lower to permit complete drain of the tub the run be complete when all the water have drain off into the waste line by this procedure rinse progress in two stage first by dilution until the time when the drain be separate and thereafter by displacement of the soil-bearing liquor by clean rinse water since soil liquor squeeze from the specimen at the nip pass directly to waste from the sud box drain this method of rinse appear to produce maximum cleanse with minimum soil redeposition suggest evaluation and classification evaluation may be make on either a soil-removal or a grease-removal basis a desire a reflectance-measuring instrument may be desirable to measure clean whereas soxhlet extraction be necessary to measure grease removal purpose and scope this test method be intend for determine the dimensional change of weave or knit fabric make of fibers other than wool to be expect when the cloth be subject to launder procedure commonly use in the commercial laundry and the home four wash test procedure be establish vary in severity from very severe to very mild and be intend to cover the range of practical wash from commercial procedure to hand wash five dry test procedure be establish to cover the range of dry technique use in the home and commercial laundry three method for determine the dimensional restorability characteristic be establish for those textile which require restoration by iron or wear after launder these test be not accelerate and must be repeat to evaluate dimensional change after repeat launderings table 1 summarize all of the various wash dry and restoration procedure available the person use these test must determine which combination of procedure be practical for any specific item in order to evaluate the dimensional change of textile fabric or garment after launder procedure commonly use in the home or commercial laundry it be possible to identify the test procedure completely with a code consist of a roman numeral a letter and an arabic number for example test 3 e 1 refer to a specimen which have be wash by procedure 3 at 160-degrees-f for a total of 60 minute in the machine have be dry in a tumble dryer by procedure e and have be subject to restorative force on the tension presser by procedure 1 principle a specimen or garment be wash in a cylindrical reverse wash wheel dry and subject to restorative force where necessary temperature and time of agitation in the wash wheel be vary to obtain different degree of severity dry procedure and application of restorative force procedure be vary to conform with end-use handle during home or commercial launder distance mark on the specimen in warp and fill direction or wale and course for knit fabric be measure before and after launder apparatus and material wash wheel cylindrical wash wheel of the reverse type the wheel cage be 20 to 24 inch inside diameter and 20 to 24 inch inside length there be three fin each approximately three inch wide extend the full length of the inside of the wheel one fin be locate every 120-degrees around the inside diameter of the wheel the wash wheel rotate at a speed of 30 revolution per minute make five to ten revolution before reverse the water inlet be large enough to permit fill the wheel to an eight-inch level in less than two minute and the outlet be large enough to permit discharge of this same amount of water in less than two minute the machine be equip with a pipe for inject live steam that be capable of raise the temperature of water at an eight-inch level from 110-degrees to 140-degrees-f 38 \* 0 to 60 \* 0c in less than two minute the machine shall contain an open for the insertion of a thermometer or other equivalent equipment for determine the temperature of the water during the wash and rinse procedure it be equip with an outside water gauge that will indicate the level of the water in the wheel a domestic automatic washer that will give equivalent result may be use the wash wheel be the equipment prefer for the test press equipment flat-bed press measure 24 inch by 50 inch or large any flat-bed press capable of press a specimen 22 inch square may be use a an alternative the flat-bed press be maintain at a temperature not less than 275-degrees-f 135 \* 0c dryer dryer of the rotary tumble type have a cylindrical basket approximately 30 inch in diameter and 24 inch in length and rotate at approximately 35 rpm the dryer be provide with a mean of maintain a dry temperature of 120-degrees - 160-degrees-f 49 \* 0 - 71 \* &0c measure in the exhaust vent a close a possible to the dry chamber screen dry rack 16-mesh screen saran or velon dry room facility for drip - or line-drying extractor centrifugal extractor of the laundry-type with a perforate basket approximately 11 inch deep by 17 inch in diameter with an operate speed of approximately 1500 rpm pen and ink indelible or other suitable mark device measure scale soap neutral chip feed spec 566 or afj softener eg sodium metaphosphate or sodium hexametaphosphate if need in hard water area detergent synthetic alkylarysulfonate type flatiron electric approximately 3 lb tension presser consist of a pad iron board from which extend clamp member on all four side two of the clamp be fix to the edge of the board whereas two clamp travel on guide rail opposite the fix clamp the movable clamp travel on carriage which ride the rail and be draw by dead-weight load set of weight be provide so that the load can be select in the range of 12 to 4 pound a perforate aluminum plate use to provide the dry surface be heat by mean of a flatiron a special template be furnish with the apparatus to enable mark a specimen for a central measure area and the fabric extension to the clamp see fig 2 knit shrinkage gauge consist of a set of 20 mount pin set in guide in radial slot fig 1 each pin be individually spring to a tension member which be drive outwardly in the slot the spring have an extension of 1 inch at afj tension the tension member have a common drive so that the application of restorative force take place simultaneously in all direction in the plane of the test specimen the minimum diameter of the pin frame in the collapse state be 11 inch and the maximum diameter in the freely extend state unload be 14 inch the surface of the apparatus in contact with the test specimen be uncluttered and polish so a to be a friction-free a possible test specimen the preparation of test specimen will vary depend upon the type of dimensional restorability procedure if any to be use three specimen for each sample to be test be require in order to arrive at a satisfactory average of performance this be especially true for knit fabric specimen be allow to reach moisture equilibrium with a standard atmosphere of afj and afj and then lay out without tension on a flat polish surface care be take that the fabric be free from wrinkle or crease fabric that be badly distort in they unlaundered state due to faulty finish may give deceptive dimensional change result when launder by any procedure this also hold true if restorative force be apply therefore it be recommend that in such case the sample be replace or if use the result of dimensional change or dimensional restorability test be consider a indicative only generally it be necessary to mark distance on a specimen or garment in both lengthwise and widthwise direction and to measure before and after launder the distance may be mark with indelible ink and a fine-point pen by sew fine thread into the fabric or by a specially design stamp machine the mark distance be parallel to the respective yarn usually the great the original distance mark the great will be the accuracy of the test distance of less than 10 inch be not recommend weave fabric to be dry by procedure b flat-bed press or restore by procedure 3 hand iron the specimen of fabric be a rectangle at least 22 by 22 inch except for cloth narrow than 22 inch in which case the specimen be the entire width of the fabric three distance each at least 18 inch be measure and mark off parallel to each of the warp and fill direction the distance be at least two inch from any edge of the specimen weave or warp knit fabric to be subject to restorative procedure 1 tension presser each specimen be at least 25 inch by 25 inch place the template fig 2 on the fabric so that the side of the 10 inch square cut out of the template be parallel to the warp and fill for weave fabric or the wale and course for knit fabric and so that the same amount of fabric extend beyond the edge of the template on all side mark the specimen at the outer edge of the template with pen and indelible ink also place three dot on the specimen at each side of the 10 inch square one dot at midpoint and one at approximately 12 inch from each corner measure and record circular knit fabric to be subject to restorative procedure 2 knit shrinkage gauge each specimen be approximately 16 inch square the marking consist of a centrally locate 10 inch diameter measure circle and a 14 inch diameter circle of 20 dot equidistantly space see figure 1 garment critical measurement in length and width direction should be take before and after wash dry and restorative procedure procedure wash the wash procedure be summarize in table 2 place the specimen in the wash wheel with sufficient other similar fabric to make a dry load of afj pound start the wash wheel and note the time immediately add water at 100 - 105-degrees-f 38 - 43 \* 0c to the wheel to a level of afj inch this level will be increase by condense steam when this water level have be reach inject steam into the wheel until the temperature reach that show in column b of table 2 add sufficient soap and softener if require to counteract hard water to furnish a good run sud or if desire use a synthetic detergent test 1 stop the wash wheel at the end of the time show in column a of table 2 and drain refill the machine to a level of afj inch with water at 100 - 109-degrees-f 38 - 43 \* 0 c
