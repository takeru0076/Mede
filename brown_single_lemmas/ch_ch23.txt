this broad delegation leave within we discretion subject to the always-present criterion of the public interest both the determination of what degree of interference shall be consider excessive and the method by which such excessive interference shall be avoid 3 the present proceed be concern with the standard broadcast be band from 540 kc to 1600 kc whenever two or more standard broadcast station operate simultaneously on the same or closely adjacent frequency each interfere to some extent with reception of the other the extent of such interference which may be so slight a to be undetectable at any point where either of the station render a usable signal or may be so great a to virtually destroy the service area of both station depend on many factor among the principal one be the distance between the station they respective radiate power and of particular significance here the time of day other factor play a part in the extent of be service and interference be the frequency involve the time of year the position of the year in the sunspot cycle ground conductivity along the transmission path atmospheric and manmade noise and other with the existence of these many factor some of they variable it obviously have never be and be not now possible for the commission to make assignment of be station on a case-to-case basis which will insure against any interference in any circumstance rather such assignment be make a they must be on the basis of certain overall rule and standard represent to some extent a statistical approach to the problem take into account for each situation some of the variable eg power and station separation and average out other in order to achieve the balance which must be strike between protection against destructive interference and the assignment of a number of station large enough to afford optimum radio service to the nation an example of the overall standard apply be the 20-to-1 ratio establish for the determination of that degree of cochannel interference which be regard a objectionable by this standard it be determine that where two station operate on the same frequency be involve objectionable interference from station a exist at any point within the service area of station b where station a s signal be of an intensity one-twentieth or more of the strength of station b s signal at that point 4 the 20-to-1 ratio for cochannel interference embody one of the fundamental limit principle which we must always take into account in be assignment and allocation that signal from a particular station be potential source of objectionable interference over an area much great than that within which they provide useful service a second fundamental principle be that involve particularly in the present proceed the difference between nighttime and daytime propagation condition with respect to the standard broadcast frequency this be a phenomenon familiar to all radio listener result from reflection of skywave signal at night from the ionize layer in the upper atmosphere know a the ionosphere all be station radiate both skywave and groundwave signal at all hour but during the middle daytime hour these skywave radiation be not reflect in any substantial quantity and during this portion of the day both skywave service and skywave interference be in general negligible but during nighttime hour the skywave radiation be reflect from the ionosphere thereby create the possibility of one station s render service via skywave at a much great distance than it can through it groundwave signal and at the same time vastly complicate the interference problem because of the still great distance over which these skywave signal may cause interference to the signal of station on the same and closely adjacent frequency because of the difference between daytime and nighttime propagation condition it have be necessary to evolve different allocation structure for daytime and nighttime broadcast in the be band with many more station operate during the day than at night 5 it be recognize year ago that the transition from daytime to nighttime propagation condition and vice versa be not an instantaneous process but take place over period of time from roughly 2 hour before sunset until about 2 hour after sunset and again from roughly 2 hour before sunrise until some 2 hour after sunrise during the period of about 4 hour around sunset skywave transmission condition be build up until full nighttime condition prevail during the same period around sunrise skywave transmission be decline until at about 2 hour after sunrise it reach a point where it become of little practical significance however in this case a elsewhere it be necessary to arrive at a single standard to be apply to all situation represent an average of condition and thus to fix particular point in time which would be consider the divide point between daytime and nighttime condition it be determine that the hour of sunrise and sunset respectively should be use for this purpose accordingly the 1938-39 rule adopt these hour a limitation upon the operation of daytime station class 2 station operate on clear channel be require to cease operation or operate under nighttime restriction begin either at local sunset for daytime class 2 station or sunset at the location of the dominant class 1 station where locate west of the class 2 station for limited-time class 2 station the same restriction apply after local sunset in the case of class 3 station operate on regional channel which after that time be require to operate under nighttime restriction in order to protect each other with respect to nighttime assignment the degree of skywave service and interference be determine by skywave curve fig 1 and 2 of sec 3190 of the rule give average skywave value these curve be derive by an analysis of extensive skywave measurement data it be recognize that skywave signal because of they reflect nature be of great variability and subject to wide fluctuation in strength for this reason the more uncertain skywave service be denominate secondary in we rule a compare to the steady more reliable groundwave primary service and for both skywave service and skywave interference signal strength be express in term of percentage of time a particular signal-intensity level be exceed 50 percent of the time for skywave service 10 percent of the time for skywave interference allocation policy 6 a mention the allocation of be station represent a balance between protection against interference and the provision of opportunity for an adequate number of station the rule and policy to be apply in this process of course must be base on objective which represent what be to be desire if radio service be to be of maximum use to the nation we objective a we have state many time be 1 to provide some service to all listener 2 to provide a many choice of service to a many listener a possible 3 to provide service of local origin to a many listener a possible since broadcast frequency be very limit in number these objective be to some extent inconsistent in that not all of they can be fully realize and to the extent that each be realize there be a correspond reduction of the possibility for full achievement of the other accordingly the commission have recognize that an optimum allocation pattern for one frequency do not necessarily represent the good pattern for other frequency and have assign different frequency for use by different class of station some 45 frequency be assign for use primarily by dominant class 1 a or class 1 b clear-channel station design to operate with adequate power and to provide service both groundwave and at night skywave over large area and at great distance be protect against interference to the degree necessary to achieve this objective in deal with these frequency the objective list first above provision of service to all listener be predominant the other objective be subordinate to it the class 1 station on these clear channel be protect to they 01-mv groundwave contour against daytime cochannel interference with respect to skywave service render at night class 1 a station be the only station permit to operate in the unite state on clear channel specify for class 1 a operation and so render skywave service free from cochannel interference whereever they may be receive class 1 b station be protect at night to they 05-mv 50-percent time skywave contour against cochannel interference since the provision of skywave service require adequate freedom from interference only class 1 station be capable of render skywave service but nighttime operation by station of other class of course entail skywave interference to groundwave service interference which be substantial unless step be take to minimize it 7 with respect to other frequency these be designate a regional or local and assign for use by class 3 and class 4 station respectively station operate generally with low power in the allocation pattern work out for these frequency the provision of long-range service have to some extent be subordinate to the other two objective assignment of multiple facility and assignment of station in a many community a possible 8 a mention the primary allocation objective to be follow in the allocation of station on clear channel be the provision of widespread service free from destructive interference during nighttime hour because of the intense skywave propagation then prevail no large number of station can be permit to operate on one of these channel if the wide area service for which these frequency be assign be to be render satisfactorily by the dominant station which must be rely upon to render it therefore under we longstanding allocation rule on some of these channel no station other than the dominant class 1 a station be permit to operate at night so that the 1 a station can render service interference free wherever it can be receive on the remainder of the clear channel the dominant class 1 b station be protect a describe above and the relatively small number of secondary class 2 station permit to operate on these channel at night be require to operate directionally and with reduce power so a to protect the class 1 station in the daytime on the other hand since skywave transmission be relatively inefficient it be possible to assign a substantially large number of station on these channel additional class 2 assignment for daytime operation can be make without cause destructive interference to the class 1 station or to each other and by they operation provide additional service on these channel and additional local outlet for a large number of community such additional daytime class 2 assignment be appropriate if optimum use be to be make of these frequency and the commission have over the year make a large number of they similarly on the regional channel many class 3 station have be assign either to operate daytime only or to operate nighttime with directional antenna and low power 9 essentially the question present for decision in the present daytime skywave proceed be whether we decision in 1938-1939 to assign station on the basis of daytime condition from sunrise to sunset be sound a a basis for be allocation or whether in the light of late development and new understand skywave transmission be of such significance during the hour immediately before sunset and after sunrise that this condition should be take into account and some station require to afford protection to other station during these hour the history of the proceed 10 the decision reach in 1938-39 be make after the accumulation of a large amount of data and thorough study thereof since then there have be a notable increase in the number of station and also the accumulation of additional data and the development of new technique for use it lead to a good understand of propagation phenomenon in 1947 affidavit be file with the commission by various clear-channel station allege that extensive interference be be cause to the service area of these station during daylight hour from class 2 station whose signal be be reflect from the ionosphere so a to create skywave intereference
