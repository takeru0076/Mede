to be in fairly good shape and still in excellent spirit but a few day after fred s return he begin hemorrhaging and that be the begin of early and complete disintegration it begin in the morning and very quickly the hemorrhage be a massive one we get dr glenn to he a quickly a we could and we wire tom of papa s desperate condition the hemorrhage be in the prostate region dr glenn see at once what have happen he have lose much blood he say it ll take a lot to replace it dr glenn i ve get a lot of blood fred speak up plenty of it let i give papa blood the doctor agree but explain that it would be necessary first to check fred s blood to ascertain whether or not it be of the same type a papa s to give a patient the wrong type of blood say the doctor would likely kill he that be in the day before blood bank of course and transfusion have to be give directly from donor to patient one have to find a donor and usually very quickly whose blood correspond with the patient s and then it take considerably long to make preparation for give transfusion they have to take blood sample to the laboratory to test they for one thing and there be much require preliminary procedure they make the test and come to fred by now it be perhaps two day or long after papa have begin hemorrhaging fred you blood match you father s all right dr glenn say but we be nt go to let you give he any but why in the name of god can nt i give i father blood fred demand why can nt i doctor because fred it could do he no good it s too late now he s past help he s a good a go and in a few minute papa be dead it be well past midnight papa have leave we about the same hour of the night that ben have pass on the date be june 20 1922 will wolfe prominent business man and pioneer resident of this section die shortly after midnight tuesday at he home 48 spruce street the asheville time of wednesday june 21 announce mr wolfe have be in decline health for many year and death be not unexpect a biographical sketch follow funeral service be hold thursday afternoon at four oclock at the home beloved dr rf campbell we first presbyterian church pastor be in charge the burial be out in riverside cemetery all about he stand tombstone he own sensitive great hand have fashion a few year before he death papa have agree with mama to make a joint will with she in which it would be provide that in the event of the death of either of they an account would be make to they child whereby each child would receive a bequest of $ 5000 cash at he death fred and ralph i husband be name executor of the estate under the term of the will fred and ralph qualify a executor and pay off what debt be currently due and they be all current since papa be never one to allow bill to go unpaid the bill be principally for hospitalization and doctor fee during the last year of he life and when he die he owe in the main only current doctor s bill after they have pay all he debt and the funeral cost ralph and fred have some fourteen thousand dollar a i remember with which to pay the bequest this manifestly would not provide $ 5000 to each of the survive five child so what fred and ralph do be to attempt to prorate the money fairly by take into account what each of the five have receive if anything from the estate before papa s death consequently fred and tom the two who have be provide college education sign statement to the effect that each have receive he bequest in full and effie and i be each allot $ 5000 frank have be give about half he legacy to use in a business venture before papa s death he be give the difference between that amount and $ 5000 tom have receive four year of education at the university of north carolina and two at harvard and fred have be in and out of georgia tech and carneigie tech and part of the time have be a self-help student so because he have receive less than tom it be feel proper that fred should receive the few hundred dollar that remain and that s how papa s estate be divide papa i should emphasize have be an invalid the last several year of he life he hospital and doctor bill have be large and he income have be cut until he be receive little except small rental on some property he still own have he be able to escape this long siege of invalidism i m convince papa would have leave a sizable estate but he have succeed well we agree he have leave we a legacy far more valuable than house and land and stock and bond for year papa and mama have be large taxpayer i recall that several year they tax exceed $ 800 in those year of low property valuation and low tax rate that payment represent ownership of much property merciful god julia i have know papa to exclaim on get he tax bill we re go to the dog but he never expect to do that and he do nt by a long shoot 35 in the spring of he second year at harvard tom have be offer a job at northwestern university a an instructor in the english department but he have delay accept this job and a he be leave to come home to papa in response to we telegram he drop a postcard to miss mccrady head of the harvard appointment office ask she please to write northwestern authority and explain the circumstance actually tom have be postponing give they an answer i m confident because he do not want to go out there to teach in fact he do nt want to teach anywhere he want to go back to harvard for another year of playwriting but papa s death have far complicate the finance of tom s hoped-for third year and for the week follow it tom do not know whether he return to harvard could be arrange but thing be work out in the family and late in august he write miss mccrady an explanatory letter in which he tell she that matter at home have be in an unsettle condition after papa s death and he have not know whether he would stay at home with mama accept the northwestern job or return to harvard but he be happy to tell she that he finance be now in such condition that he could go back to harvard for a third year with professor baker and that s what he do that third year he write play with a fury i believe there be seventeen short play by tom now house in the houghton library at harvard i think i m right in that figure that fall he submit to professor baker the first act and outline of the follow act of several play six of they accord to some of he associate and he also work on a play that he first call niggertown the material for which he have collect during the summer at home late this play would be call welcome to we city in the spring it must have be he begin work on the play that he call the house which late would be mannerhouse that spring welcome to we city be select for production by the 47 workshop and it be stage in the middle of may it run two night and though it be generally praise there be considerable criticism of it length it run until past one oclock that be tom s weakness it be demonstrate many critic would late point out in the length of he novel in this play there be so many character and so much detail tom never know how to condense to boil down he be always concern with life and he try to picture it whole he want nothing compress tight he be a big man and he want nothing little squeeze he despise parsimony and particularly of word in this play there be some thirty or more name character and i do nt know how many more unnamed in describe it to professor baker after it have be choose for production he defend he great array of character by declare that he have include that many not because i do nt know how to save paint but because the play require they and he threaten someday to write a play with fifty eighty a hundred people a whole town a whole race a whole epoch he say he would do it though probably nobody would produce it for he own soul s ease and comfort that summer tom attend the summer session at harvard but he do not ask mama to send he back in the fall instead he go down to new york and submit welcome to we city to the theatre guild which have ask he to let they have a look at it after professor baker have recommend it highly he hang around new york wait to hear whether they would accept it for production and in that time come down to asheville and also pay a short visit to chapel hill where with almost childish delight he visit old friend and favorite campus spot on return to new york he have a job for several week it be visit university of north carolina alumni in new york to ask they for contribution to the graham memorial build fund the graham memorial would be the campus student union honoring the late and much beloved edward kidder graham who have be president when tom enter the university well the theatre guild keep that play and keep it and finally in december they turn it down but they would reconsider it they assure he if he would rewrite it tom tell i about it how one even he go over to see the theatre guild man this man tom say have the play shut up in he desk i believe and when tom sit down he pull it out and apologetically tell tom that they would nt be able to use it tom say he almost burst into tear he be so disappoint and put out the man tom say explain that it be not only too long and detail but that a it stand it be nt the sort of thing the public want the public tom say the man tell he want realism and he play be nt that it be fantastic write beautiful write the man declare but the public he insist want realism tom be not will to revise the play accord to the plan the man suggest such a revision he say would ruin it would change he whole conception of the play a well a the treatment he think about it and he tell the man he just could nt do it over in accordance with the suggestion he have make
