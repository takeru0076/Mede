mid-september to june the director walter e clark believe that a school with child live full time in it care must take full responsibility for they welfare to he this mean care for the whole child provide basic nutrition and a spiritual attitude that lend freedom for the development of the mind improve farm method the concept of good nutrition really begin with the garden the school have always maintain a farm to supply the need of the school in a climate hostile to agriculture mr clark have have to keep alert to the most productive farm technique where a grow season may with luck allow 60 day without frost and where the soil be poor sandy quick-drying and subject to erosion many farmer fail throughout the adirondack region abandon farm home and wild orchard bear ghostly testimony that they owner meet defeat mr clark find that orthodox procedure of deep plow use of chemical fertilizer and insecticide plus the application of conservation principle of rotation and contour do not prevent sheet erosion in the potato field and depreciation of the soil to give up these notion require a revolution in think mr clark say in reminisce about the abrupt change in idea he experience when he begin read organic garden and modern nutrition in a search for help with he problem louis bromfield s writing excite i a a conservationist by 1952 he be convince he would no long spray he lock he equipment in a cabinet where it still remain after read plowman s folly by edward h faulkner he stop plow the basis for compost material already exist on the school farm with a stable of animal for the ride program poultry for egg pig to eat garbage a beef herd and waste of all kind separate pail be keep in the kitchen for coffee ground and egg shell all these material and supplementary manure and other fertilizer from neighboring dairy and poultry farm make over 40 ton of finish compost a year it be apply with a compost shredder make from a convert manure spreader year of patient application of compost and leaf mulch have change the structure of the soil and it water-holding capacity soon after the method change visitor begin ask how he manage to irrigate he soil to keep it look moist when in reality it be the soil treatment alone that accomplish this to demonstrate the soil of he vegetable garden a it be today mr clark stoop to scoop up a handful of rich dark earth sniff it sweet smell and let it fall to show it good crumbly consistency he point to the nearby driveway and say this soil use to be like that hard pack road over there people and soil respond slowly say walter clark but the time have now come when the garden produce delicious long-keeping vegetable due to this enrichment program no chemical fertilizer and poisonous insecticide and fungicide be use the garden supply enough carrot turnip rutabagas potato beet cabbage and squash to store for winter meal in the root cellar the carrot sometimes do nt make it through the winter the cabbage and squash keep until march or april there be never enough corn pea or strawberry mr clark still have to use rotenone with potato grow on the least fertile field but he have watch the insect damage decrease steadily and hope that continue use of compost and leaf mulch will allow he to do without it in the future a new project plan be the use of bio-dynamic starter new idea for improve nutrition come with the study of soil treatment after the soil the kitchen say mr clark the first major change be that of provide wholewheat bread instead of white bread adult take a long time to convince and you be thwart if you try to push at first the kitchen help be tolerant but order they own supply of white bread for themselves you can nt make french toast with whole-wheat bread be an early complaint of course they learn in time that they not only could use whole-wheat bread but the child like it good homemade bread mrs clark a house manager plan the menu and care for the order then miss lillian colman come from vermont to be kitchen manager today whole grain be freshly ground every day and bake into bread mr clark s study teach he that the only way to conserve the vitamin in the whole grain
