some year ago julian huxley propose to an audience make up of member of the british association for the advancement of science that man s supernormal or extra-sensory faculty be now in the same case a be he mathematical faculty during the ice age a a humanist dr huxley interest himself in the possibility of human development and one thing we can say about this suggestion which come from a lead zoologist be that so far a he be concern the scientific outlook place no rigid limitation upon the idea of future human evolution this text from dr huxley be sometimes use by enthusiast to indicate that they have the permission of the scientist to press the case for a wonderful unfoldment of psychic power in human being there may be a case of this sort but it be not one we wish to argue here even if people do in a not far distant future begin to read one another s mind there will still be the question of whether what you find in another man s mind be especially worth read worth more that be than what you can read in good book even if man eventually find themselves able to look through wall and around corner one may question whether this will help they to live good life there would be side-conclusions to be draw of course such capacity be impressive evidence point to a conception of the human be which do not appear in the account of biologist and organic evolutionist but the basic puzzle of existence would still be puzzle and we should still have to work out the sort of problem we plan to discuss in this article all we want from dr huxley s statement be the feel that this be an open world in the view of the good scientific opinion with practically no directional commitment a to what may happen next and no important confinement with respect to what may be possible it seem quite obvious that all the really difficult task of human being arise from the fact that man be not one but many each man that be be both one and many he be a dreamer of the good society with a plan to put into effect and he be an individual craftsman with something to make for himself and the people of he time he be a parent with a child to nurture here and now and he be an educator who worry about the child half way round the world he be a utopian with a stake in tomorrow and he be a vulnerable human make captive by the circumstance of today he can sacrifice himself for tomorrow and he can sacrifice tomorrow for himself he be a craig s wife who agonizes about tobacco ash on the live room rug and he be a forgetful genius who go boat with the town baker when dignitary from the local university have come to call he be the stern guardian of the status quo who have raise the utilitarian structure of the age and he be the revolutionary poet with a gun in he hand who write a tragic apologetic to posterity for the man he have kill what will be the final symmetry of the good society for what do the utopian labor here on a desk be a stack of pamphlet represent the effort of some of the good man of the day to penetrate these question the pamphlet be about law the corporation form of government the idea of freedom the defense of liberty the various lethargies which overtake we major institution the gap between traditional social ideal and the work mechanism that have be set in motion for they realization the thing that be notable in all these discussion be the lack of ideological ardor there be another kind of ardor a quiet sure devotion to the fundamental decency of human life but no angry utopian contention actually you could wish for some passion now and then but when you look around the world and see the little volcano of current history which partisan social passion have work you be glad that in these pamphlet there be at least some civilize calm you could also say that in these pamphlet be a relieve quality of maturity there be essential pleasantness in read the write of man who be not angry who can contend without quarreling this be the good kind of sophistication and with all we problem and crisis this kind of sophistication have flower in the unite state during recent year a characteristic expression of such concern and inquiry be find in joseph p lyford s introduction to the agreeable autocracy a recent paperback study of the institution of modern democratic society mr lyford give voice to a temper that represent we think an achieve plateau of reflective think after cast about for a way of describe this spirit we decide that it would be good to use mr lyford s introduction a an illustration he begin at one time it seem a if the soviet union have do we a favor by provide a strike example of how not to behave towards other people and other nation a thing turn out however we have not profit greatly from the lesson instead of persistently follow a national program of we own we have often be satisfy to be against whatever soviet policy seem to be at the moment such activity may or may not have irritate the kremlin but it have frequently condemn america to an unnatural defensiveness that have undermine we effort to give leadership to the free world the defensiveness have be exaggerate by another bad habit we tendency to rate the goodness or badness of other nation by the extent to which they applaud the slogan we circulate about ourselves since the slogan have little application to reality and be sanctimonious to boot the applause be faint even in area of the world where we should expect to find the great affection for free government shock at the response to we proclamation we grow more defensive and bad we lose we sense of humor and proportion mr nehru be subject to stern lecture on neutralism by we department of state and an american president observe sourly that sweden would be a little less neurotic if it be a little more capitalistic one thing you can say about mr lyford be that he do not suffer from any insecurity a an american those who be insecure fear to be candid in self-examination only the strong look squarely at weakness the maturity in this point of view lie in it recognition that no basic problem be ever solve without be clearly understand mr lyford continue even if the self portrait we distribute for popular consumption be accurate it would be dangerous to present it a a picture of the ideal society we would be ignore the special circumstance of other country the picture be the more treacherous when it misrepresent the fact of american life the discrepancy between what we commonly profess and what we practice or tolerate be great and it do not escape the notice of other if we sincerity be grant and it be grant the discrepancy can only be explain by the fact that we have come to believe hearsay and legend about ourselves in preference to an understand gain by earnest self-examination what be more the legend have become so sacrosanct that the very habit of self-examination or self-criticism smell of low treason and man who practice it be defeatist and unpatriotic scoundrel although we continue to pay we conversational devotion to free private enterprise individual initiative the democratic way government of the people competition of the marketplace etc we live rather comfortably in a society in which economic competition be diminish in large area bureaucracy be corrode representative government technology be weaken the citizen s confidence in he own power to make decision and the threat of war be drive he economically and physically into the ground the interest thing about mr lyford s approach and the approach of the contributor to the agreeable autocracy oceana publication 1961 to the situation of american civilization be that it be concern with comprehend the psychological relationship which be have a decisive effect on american life in an ideological argument the participant tend to thump the table they be determine to prove something the new spirit so well illustrate by mr lyford s work be wholly free of this anxiety the problem be rather to find out what be actually happen and this be especially difficult for the reason that we be busily be defend from a knowledge of the present sometimes by the very agency we educational system we mass media we statesman on which we have have to rely most heavily for understand of ourselves the introduction continue we experience a vague uneasiness about event a suspicion that we political and economic institution like the genie in the bottle have escape confinement and that we have lose the power to recall they we feel uncomfortable at be boss by a corporation or a union or a television set but until we have some knowledge about these phenomenon and what they be do to we we can hardly learn to control they it do not appear that we will be deliver from we situation by article on the national purpose the agreeable autocracy be an attempt to explore some of the institution which both reflect and determine the character of the free society today the man who speculate on these institution have for the most part come to at least one common conclusion that many of the great enterprise and association around which we democracy be form be in themselves autocratic in nature and possess of power which can be use to frustrate the citizen who be try to assert he individuality in the modern world these institution which mr lyford name agreeable autocracy where do they come from of one thing we can be sure they be not sketch out by the revolutionary theorist of the eighteenth century who formulate the political principle and originally shape the political institution of what we term the free society no doubt there be historian who can explain to a great extent what happen to the plan and project of the eighteenth century go back over this ground and analyze the composition of force which have create the present scene be one of the task undertake by the center for the study of democratic institution in santa barbara but however we come finally to explain and account for the present the truth we be try to expose right now be that the maker of constitution and the designer of institution find it difficult if not impossible to anticipate the behavior of the host of all they enterprise the host be the flow life of the human race this life have it own current and rhythm it own multiple cycle and adaptation on occasion it produce extraordinary novelty should rousseau have be able to leave room in he social theory for the advent of television atomic energy and ibm machine how would thoma jefferson feel after read factory in the field they tell we sir that we be free because we have in one hand a ballot and in the other a stock certificate with these we shape we destiny and own private property and that sir make ours the good of all possible society the reality of the situation however be describe by mr lyford many of we may even be secretly relieve at have a plausible excuse to delegate ancient civic responsibility to a new bureaucracy of expert thus the member of an industrial union come to regard he officer a business agent who may proceed without interference or recall the stockholder deliver he proxy and the citizen narrow he political participation to the mere act of vote if he vote at all
