already the city be fill with barbudos the bearded war-dirty revolutionary carry carbine wave to the crowd that line the prado and then castro himself do come bearded smile yet if you look closely you d see that he eye do not pick up the smile on he lip at first i be happy to throw the support of we newspaper behind this man i be sure that castro be happy too about that support diario de la marina be the old and most influential paper in cuba with a reputation for speak out against tyranny i grandfather have be stone because of he editorial i own early memory be of exile i three brother and i

suspicion be grow that fidel castro be a communist in i mind i begin to review he use of hate to gain support he people s court he division of society into two class one the hero the other the villain but most disturb of all be the adviser he call to sit with he in the palace many come from communist country what should i do about it i ask myself i have watch castro handle he enemy before the paredon there be no doubt in i mind that if i cross he mob would appear outside we window shout paredon paredon what should i do i be proud of the new building which house diario now the rotogravures gleam behind glass door the thump and whir of we new press here be a powerful ready-made medium but it could speak only if i tell it to then one day early in january 1960 i sit down at i desk and suddenly i be aware of the crucifix it be a simple ivory crucifix which i mother have give i i have mount it on velvet and hang it over i desk to remind i always to use the power of the paper in a christian manner now it seem almost a if jesus be look down at i with sadness in he eye say you will lose the paper you may lose you life but do you have any choice i know in that moment that i do not have any choice from that day on i begin to write editorial about the thing i do not think correct in fidel castro s regime
