uncover during the return trip barco keep mutter to himself in meaningless phrase such a they re under sand dune they re good off i tell you i save they soul the detective comment on barco s behavior feel that he merely belong among the myriad citizen of we community who be mentally unhinge that he be a more or less harmless nut however while in he cell await trial for theft barco in a fit of

like an opportunity to put he theory to the test so he pay a call on barco in he cell and begin they chat by state bluntly barco we ve get the goods on you it ll be a lot good if you come clean at first barco be evasive and shifty but with welch s relentless pursuit of the subject barco finally break and start confess to one murder after another by the time barco reach the count of three the situation seem to welch almost too good to be true but if true it be the case of which he have dream the case which would throw he into headline all over america a the hero of a great murder trial welch summon jail official to barco s cell but to welch s chagrin the police captain pooh-poohed welch s credulity in barco s confession barco be clearly a nut it require strength bravado dare to commit murder that worm a murderer ridiculous then for the first time since he arrest a glint of spirit light barco s eye he manhood have be attack he stiffen and rise to he foot he d show they be that so he query well for ten year i ve be murder woman i can lead you to every one of the body and there ai nt four nor five nor six of em there s seven the next day the police captain in derision organize what he term welch s wild goose chase for indeed it seem incredible that anyone could go on commit murder for ten year and not get catch at it even in hollywood the search party consist of the police captain welch barco policeman with shovel newspaper reporter and cameraman barco he state of apprehension go never to return have assume a matter-of-factness which remain he principal attitude from that time on he direct the cortege of auto to the sand dune near santa monica stop the car at a fork in the road he get out pace off a certain distance to a spot between two shrub-covered sand hill and indicate a location order be give to dig nothing be find welch be worry the police captain chortle the newspaper boy crack joke and again barco s pride be arouse with great

when finally one of the shovel strike an object there s something here say the digger joke stop and everyone gather around the digger thrust about with he shovel now raise into view a package crudely wrap in one of the murderer s hollywood sport shirt although it be a mere fragment of the victim s remain it be enough welch be wild with delight he elation grow a barco s seven disclosure bring to light one reward after another now do welch truly become the man of the hour and everything that follow in the procedure of justice be a new triumph for he it go to he head and he ambition increase it be apparent that welch be in cahoots with marshall and would use he power a da to drag every possible sensation into the case every new scandal which would provide more copy for marshall s pen would thus mean more publicity for welch i know that both these cynic be wait with impatience for the dramatic moment when viola be call to the stand once there the da with devilish cleverness would provide marshall with headline viola s multiple romance viola lake an addict downfall of another film idol it would be fine publicity for the man who be will to walk to the mayor s throne over the break reputation of a helpless girl i study welch closely a the trial progress for any hint which might give i a lead a to how he might be thwart it be nt long before i sense that there be something deep than overvaulting ambition back of he desire for viola s destruction he be bitter and resentful toward she personally resentful a dreadful fear enter i consciousness that perhaps he have entertain aspiration toward viola s favor or even more serious perhaps that he have attain a share of they and have then be supersede by some lucky chap i do not rest until i have track the mystery down well here it be one day over a year before there have be a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown hotel viola have be urge to attend by telephone and not know the host or the character of the party she have go she arrive late and a she enter the party note that gentleman seem to be in the majority the air be thick with smoke empty bottle be in evidence and several of the guest be somewhat the bad for liquor naturally viola have no wish to remain but she feel she could nt leave so soon after she arrival in all politeness to she host and it so happen that adjacent to a couch on which she have take refuge be a small table on which she note a vase of red rosebud while project from beneath the couch be a pair of foot which a fate would have it belong to district attorney welch a viola sit there a playful impulse overcome she to remove the shoe and sock from the unidentified foot and a a prank insert rosebud between the toe a little late the district attorney wake up emerge from under the couch look at he watch and realize he have an engagement that very hour to address a meet of the culture forum on the civic spirit of the southland in the byzantine room of the hotel where he wife a president of the forum be to preside he make he way to he host s bedroom where he carefully brush himself off neatly arrange he hair and painstakingly select he hat from the many on the bed then note neither the absence of he footwear nor the presence of the rosebud he make he way to the byzantine room and with he usual dignity mount the rostrum the effect on the intellectual among he audience may well be imagine the incident aside from reflect on welch s political career have all but wreck he home life he never rest until he discover who the culprit be and when he do he vow vengeance on viola lake if ever the chance come he way and here it be by such innocent action be human tragedy sometimes set in motion during these first day of the trial i do nt have a much time to commiserate with viola a i should have like in the first place it be difficult for we to meet we could nt be see together for the tongue of scandal be ever ready to link we name and the tongue of scandal find but one thing to say of the association of a man with a girl no matter how innocent i could nt invite viola to we house for mother snobbishly refuse to receive she now the czarship have not affect i own sense of social value but mother have attain a reflect glory through it which have open the door of los angeles-pasadena society to she there mother be receive by the scion of aristocratic line which be dominate by the budweisers of beer derivation the chalmers of underwear origin and the heinzes whose forbear found a nationally famous trade in pickle i hate be drag into the salon of these aristocrat but mother insist for it be seldom indeed that anyone remotely connect with the cinema be ever receive in they exclusive midsts in fact it be not until the king of spain have visit at pickfair that mary and doug be beckon to cross the sacred barrier which separate los angeles and pasadena from the hoi-polloi mother even go so far a to trump up for i matrimonial opportunity with pasadena deb who have be educate abroad and with those of the more lenient los angeles area where a debutante be a girl who have be to high school but at long last come a time when i break away from mother and she society chi-chi in order to spend a cosy even with viola and she chaperon at she home however such a hotbed of gossip have grow up during the trial that every precaution have to be take to keep i visit from be whisper to the world society and even alas to i own mother when i arrive at viola s i be show to i surprise into the kitchen viola greet i in check apron ladle in hand and explain it be the cook s night out and that she herself be prepare dinner i sit and watch proceeding there be to be roast chicken with dress giblet gravy asparagus new pea with a sprig of
