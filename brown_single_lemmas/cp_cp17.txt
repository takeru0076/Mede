when bobbie evan smash up he car the jaguar he wife linda have give he for he last birthday and himself quite thoroughly with it drive back from an afternoon s golf at oakmont it seem to mark the end of a long miswritten chapter in the social life of the community linda look remote yet lovely in black and everyone hold he or she breath not that linda be heartless not that she would do anything prematurely or in bad taste any more than john cooper would have nt linda be a perfect wife to bobbie who be the least bit of a disappointment all these year be nt john cooper even more attractive at forty-seven than he have be twenty-five year early and be nt john s wife edythe even more appal if possible do nt john cooper after all this time deserve something good of life be nt it adult and realistic to look at it that way and romantic everybody know that john cooper have marry edythe on the rebound it be the kind of thing that could ruin a man s life and it be a tribute to john s strength of character and very real business ability that it have nt ruine he of course there be nothing you could do but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for let it happen mousie chandler say to linda stuart poor john linda accept the reproach which be something she do rarely in all she life and most rarely in that summer of 1936 when she be by all odds the pretty and bright young woman west of the allegheny mountain and john be surely one of the handsome and bright young man around pittsburgh for it have be john and linda ever since she have come out two season before at the golf club to the goggle-eyed admiration not only of the stag line but even of she fellow deb john have claim she from the stag line a young man a year out of dartmouth with ski crinkle still around he eye you see they always together those year you talk about john-and-linda a an entity john-and-linda be at longue vue last night john-and-linda drive to conneaut in three and a half hour then there be a spit over something a there have be lover spat before only this one do nt heal you still say john-and-linda but a if you be speak of a national catastrophe such a the depression or dillinger it get bad instead of good first it come out after mr cooper s will be settle he have die the year before that john and he mother be nt rich any more and then there be linda s engagement to bobbie evan there be no connection between the two event because bobbie be nt rich either though he be more aggressive than john he be a bright and handsome young man from new york who work for the same steel company a john do some people say linda have just announce the engagement to jolt john into some action but when john come home from a business trip to cleveland with edythe with edythe he bride it could no long be john-and-linda even to sentimental wishful thinker it be nt even john and edythe it be simply poor john there be nothing specifically wrong with edythe but there be absolutely nothing right about she either mousie chandler have be to school with she someplace near baltimore and try to explain rather than defend she to the gang have lunch at horne s well you should nt underestimate edythe mousie say i know she give the impression of be shallow and frivolous and scatterbrained she be frivolous and scatterbrained but she really be nt shallow bobbie and linda look magnificent at they wedding john be at the church with edythe she giggle during the ceremony and mousie chandler who be one of linda s bridesmaid say john glare black a death at she a if he be choke she say poor john edythe settle down to become a social myth and a horrible example she hair never seem to be in place and she skirt be never quite the correct length she do nt have a bad shape when you catch she at the pool at longue vue but she bathing suit be far from smart and you do nt see she much at longue vue or anywhere for john have drift away from the gang mousie say it be because he be too proud to stand pity other think he could nt stand see linda mrs bobbie evan still so beautiful so much in command of everything there be less-dramatic reason too john s mother die not long after he marriage and there be even less cooper money leave john sell the big old place in sewickley and buy a small house in fox chapel he be not reduce to poverty but he job at the steel company have become a real job and not a method of pass the day john be good at he job it probably be nt hard for he to keep he nose to the grindstone with nothing but edythe to come home to though that may be unfair since ben cooper john s first son come along early in 1938 the cute baby you ever see and a bless that he look all cooper from fontanel to pink toe nary a trace of edythe but the continue charm of the other child sally in 1940 and jack in 1944 and all john s success at he work only make edythe s dizziness and general uselessness more glare she never could fit into a crowd which have know which still know and admire linda when there be bridge at edythe s house the card shuffle like wet graham cracker and the food probably be wet graham cracker she manage a missionary drive for the church once and get the book so confuse that old mr webber the eldest elder who d never donate more than five dollar to anything have to cough up five hundred dollar to avoid a scandal in what edythe call the bosom of the church john do find the miss check and money afterward and the drive be actually oversubscribed which be a real bit of luck for the missionary be an intelligent man john must have guess what everyone think about edythe but he never let on by so much a a brave smile poor john be the kind of stock that keep a bargain without whimper and maybe bend over backward to keep a bad one he be an attentive and generous husband overgenerous a lot of people feel because they know that money must be a problem to he but he get ahead in business on leave from he job to an important washington assignment during the war after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel company the cooper see bobbie and linda socially but no more than be necessary bobbie have be successful too though he do nt match john s pace and after all he do nt need to with all the stuart money he and linda settle down to be social leader and linda manage to look a little more beautiful each year and then come the hairpin turn the smash jaguar and linda mourn alone and lovely everyone hold he or she breath do nt think linda could nt have get john back any time if she d try mousie gordon who have be mousie chandler say between bite of a chicken sandwich at a luncheon table at le mont now you know she could ve but she be nt that kind of girl but now well it would be a bless i think poor john linda evan feel more wretched than she have ever dream bobbie s death could move she to feel what she feel be a bone-deep loss with a sense of waste to it not so much sorrow for handsome ambitious bobbie but for the lose year that have be bring into high relief by he death she know what people be think it be what she have be think herself it be up to she to save poor john dear john to undo the wrong she have do but she tremble at the decision a at the brink of a cold stream there be no one who would blame she or john she could be sure of that it might be rough on edythe at first but linda and john between they could make a settlement handsome enough to soothe she to send she back to cleveland or anywhere and linda feel capable of capture the affection of the child anxious even since she and bobbie have have none of they own it would be good for they to have a mother they need not be ashamed of linda would have to wait she know but what be a decent six month or so after the more than twenty year go by year of watch while poor john struggle without the help and understand of the kind of wife a man need to get ahead of course he have do wonder alloy steel and regular steel have different sales department at smith & macisaacs where john and bobbie both work bobbie have be head of the alloy division while john be just another good salesman in the regular branch so when old mr lovejoy the company president talk about put in a single sales manager for both branch after the head of the regular steel have go with carnegie-illinois it look like the perfect chance for bobbie for linda know how to help she husband not just the stuart-family contact but also the little dinner for reuben lovejoy she be almost sick when bobbie come home with the news that poor john have win the job what do you do she ask bobbie you must have do something something wrong lord know i have everything set for you bobbie say something about damn pittsburghers stick together and linda get angry at he they have they first real fight and bobbie go off to get drink linda dragoon she uncle donald murkland into a lunch the next day to find out what have happen he be a director of s & m and must have be in on the decision but jolly old uncle donald would tell she no more than that bobbie have certainly be consider for the job but there be factor in a large company which outsider and even some insider could nt understand he do nt tell she of the long board meet where bobbie and john be weigh one against the other i m behind john cooper mr lovejoy say finally i think we re agree that he and evan be equal in ability so we have to look at the thing in term of incentive now i believe poor john ll work just a little hard with that wife of he i think he feel every chance he get be he big chance bobbie with linda behind he will have plenty of other opportunity and also the money can nt mean a much to bobbie bobbie will take the job a he just reward and work hard at it poor john will take it a a miracle and have every other independent steel company sit up night worry about we most of the director nod uncle donald murkland find himself nod agreement too after the surprise be over linda be almost a please a anyone with john s good luck though she agree with bobbie s decision some month late to move to funk furnace the job at funk be nt particularly good but it get he away from be subordinate to john and assure he steady advancement since funk be own to a large degree by various branch of linda s family poor john s rise continue to be meteoric when he be make a vice president only a year after the new sales job a lead business magazine run he photograph with a brief biography in a series on national business leader of the future
