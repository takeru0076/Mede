northern liberal be the chief supporter of civil right and of integration they have also lead the nation in the direction of a welfare state and both in they objective of non-discrimination and of social progress they have have range against they the southerner who be call bourbon the name presumably derive from the french royal house which never learn and never forget since bourbon whiskey though of kentucky origin be at least a much favore by liberal in the north a by conservative in the south the nature of the opposition between liberal and bourbon be too little understand in the north the race problem have tend to obscure other less emotional issue which may fundamentally be even more divisive it be these other difference between north and south other that be than those which concern discrimination or social welfare which i chiefly discuss herein i write about northern liberal from considerable personal experience a southerner marry to a new englander i have live for many year in a connecticut commute town with a high percentage of artist writer publicity man and business executive of egghead taste most of they be democrat and nearly all consider themselves and be view a liberal this be puzzle to an outsider conscious of the classic tradition of liberalism because it be clear that these democrat who be left-of-center be at opposite pole from the liberal jefferson who hold that the good government be the least government yet paradoxically i liberal friend continue to view jefferson a one of they patron saint when i question they a to what they mean by concept like liberty and democracy i find that they fall into two category the simple one who have simply accept the shibboleth of they faith without analysis and the intelligent cynical one who scornfully reply that these thing do nt count any more in the world of to-day i be naive they say to make use of such word i take this to mean that the intelligent and therefore necessarily cynical liberal consider that the need for a national economy with control that will assure he conception of social justice be so great that individual and local liberty a well a democratic process may have to yield before it this seem like an attitude favore a sort of totalitarian bureaucracy which under a president of the same stamp would try to coerce an uncooperative congress or supreme court a for state right they have never count in the think of i liberal friend except a irritation of a minor and immoral nature which exist now only a anachronism the american liberal may in the world of to-day have a strong case but he present it publicly so enmesh in hypocrisy that it be not an honest one why in the first place call himself a liberal if he be against laissez-faire and favor an authoritarian central government with womb-to-tomb control over everybody if he attach little importance to personal liberty why not make this know to the world and if he be so scornful of the right of state why not advocate a different sort of constitution that he could more sincerely support i be concern here however with the northern liberal s attitude toward the south it appear to be one of intense dislike which he make little effort to conceal even in the presence of southern friend he assumption seem to be that any such friend be tolerable human must be more liberal than most southerner and therefore at least partly in sympathy with he view time s editor thoma griffith in he book the waist-high culture write most of what be different about it the deep south i find myself unsympathetic to this for the liberal i know would be an understatement theirs be no mere lack of sympathy but something close to the passionate hatred that be direct against fascism i do not think that i experience would be typical for southerner live in the north in business circle usually conservative this sort of atmosphere would hardly be find but in we case and neither i wife nor i have extreme view on integration nor be we give to emotional outburst the situation have ruine one or two value friendship and come close to wreck several more in fact it have cause we to give serious think to move we residence south because it be not easy for the most objective southerner to sit calmly by when he host be tell a roomful of people that the only way to deal with southerner who oppose integration be to send in troop and shoot the bastard down account have be publish of northern liberal in the south up against segregationist prejudice especially in state-supported university where pressure may be strong to uphold the majority view but these account do not show that northerner have be subject to embarrassment or provocation by yankee-hatred display in social gathering from i wife s experience and other source this seem to be rarely encounter in educate circle the strong feel be certainly there but there be a leaven of liberalism among college graduate throughout the south especially among those who study in the north and social relation arise out of business tie impose courtesy if not sympathy toward resident and visit northerner also among the latter a large percentage soon acquire the prevalent southern attitude on most social problem there be of course many south but for this discussion the most important division be between those who have be reconstruct and those who have nt i definition of this much abuse adjective be that a reconstruct rebel be one who be glad that the north win the war nobody know how many southerner there be in this category i suspect that there be far more unreconstructed one than the north like to believe i never hear of a poll be take on the question no doubt such a thing would be consider unpatriotic prior to 1954 i imagine that a majority of southerner would have vote against the confederacy since the supreme court s decision of that year this be more doubtful and if a poll have be take immediately follow the dispatch of troop to little rock i believe the majority would have be for the old south belief in the traditional way of life persist much more in the old state than in the new one probably a large percentage of virginian and south carolinians remain unreconstructed than elsewhere with georgia north carolina and alabama follow along after they old attitude be hold more tenaciously in the tidewater than the piedmont so that a line run down the length of the south mark the upper limit of tidewater would roughly divide the old south from the new but with of course important minority enclave the long-settled area of state like virginia and south carolina develop the ante-bellum culture to it rich flower and there the memory be more precious and the consciousness of loss the great also we should not even to-day discount the fact that a region such a the coastal lowland center on charleston have close tie with england and the west indies than with the north even after independence the social and psychological consequence of this continue to affect the area in certain respect defeat increase the persistent anglophilia of the old south poor where they have once be rich humble where they have be arrogant have no long any hope of share in the leadership of the nation the rebel who would not surrender in spirit draw comfort from the sympathy they feel extend to they by the mother country and no doubt many people in state like the carolinas and georgia which be among the most tory in sentiment in the eighteenth century bitterly regret the revolt against the crown among bourbon the racial issue may have less to do with they remain unreconstructed than other factor all southerner agree that slavery have to go but many historian maintain that except for northern meddle it would have end in state like virginia year before it do southern resentment have be over the method of it end the invasion and reconstruction they fear now be of miscegenation and negro political control in many county but apart from racial problem the old unreconstructed south to use the moderate word favore by mr thoma griffith find itself unsympathetic to most of what be different about the civilization of the north and this in effect mean most of modern america it be hard to see how the situation could be otherwise and therein i feel many northerner delude themselves about the south for one thing this be not a subject often discuss or analyze there seem to be almost a conspiracy of silence veil it i suppose the reason be a kind of wishful think do nt talk about the final stage of reconstruction and they will take care of themselves or else the north really believe that all southerner except a few quaint old character have come around to realize the error of they past and be now at heart sharer of the american dream like everybody else if the circumstance be face frankly it be not reasonable to expect this to be true the situation of the south since 1865 have be unique in the western world regardless of right and wrong a population and an area appropriate to a pre-world-war - 1 great power have be follow conquest rule against they will by a neighboring people and have have impose upon they social and economic control they dislike and the great majority of these people be of anglo-saxon or celtic descent this be the only case in modern history of a people of britannic origin submit without continue struggle to what they view a foreign domination the fact be due mainly to international war both hot and cold in every war of the unite state since the civil war the south be more belligerent than the rest of the country so instead of be test of the south s loyalty the spanish war the two world war and the korean war all serve to overcome old grievance and cement reunion and there be no section of the nation more ardent than the south in the cold war against communism have the situation be reverse have for instance england be the enemy in 1898 because of issue of concern chiefly to new england there be little doubt that large number of southerner would have happily put on they old confederate uniform to fight a ally of britain it be extraordinary that a people a proud and warlike a southerner should have be a docile a they have the north should thank it star that such have be the case but at the same time it should not draw false inference therefrom the two main charge level against the bourbon by liberal be that they be racist and social reactionary there be much truth in both these charge and not many bourbon deny they whatever they fault they be not hypocrite most of they sincerely believe that the anglo-saxon be the good race in the world and that it should remain pure many northeners believe this too but few of they will say so publicly the bourbon economic philosophy moreover be not very different from that of northern conservative but those among the bourbon who remain unreconstructed go much far than this they believe that if the south have be let alone it would have produce a civilization superior to that of modern america a it be they consider that the north be now reap the fruit of excess egalitarianism that in spite of it high standard of live the american way have be prove inferior to the english and scandinavian way although they disapprove of the socialistic feature of the latter the south s antipathy to northern civilization include such charge a poor manner harsh accent lack of appreciation of the art of live like gastronomy and the use of leisure they own easy slow tempo be especially dear to southerner and i have hear many say that they be content to earn a half or a third a much a they could up north because they so much prefer the quiet habit of they home town
