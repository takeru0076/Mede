deficit adam beset by change defense condition and the open secret that he be part of the new corporation could nt deliver from he end the wisconsin plant turn out to be a white elephant stock willis

i m in something of a bind freddy s solution do nt appeal to i in addition to other defect i m a stubborn man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment will you see if you can help i william spend a long week end closet with hamrick he recent experience in motor car advertise a love for car of themselves the existence of a-z s useless wisconsin set-up exposure to exciting conception of hamrick s that nobody would buy and the coincidental recent failure of a respect but out-dated small-car manufacturer call ticonderoga motor have give he an idea of such dimension he be almost afraid to broach it initially hamrick s reaction to a-z go into the passenger car market be discourage he think the finance the advertise the production of new model the found of a nationwide chain of dealership be simply too difficult then he catch fire if a-z could buy ticonderoga cheaply and use they press and die and other equipment if william could hit precisely the right promotion note if the money hurdle be not insurmountable they take nearly a month to investigate marshal statistics and put they argument down in black and white take hamrick with he william go to mr willis he be surprise and dubious but impress by the engineer and the report you alternative be breathtaking he say and i m frank in say a bit mad i wish i be young and less timid well i can nt resolve this myself i ll have to call in the brain trust be you will to run the gantlet i can nt guarantee you a sympathetic audience we ll be in there swing william say but in a way sir you ve get to decide it yourself you have the control interest and the principal expenditure be yours and besides nobody else be go to have the courage if they follow anyone it ll have to be you he pause i should explain there s more here for i than advocate i little dream there s you you must nt take a fall or publicly back away i hate that you re you re arthur willis forgive the heart and flower theme i rather like

machine age look what those little european job be do we ll woo the consumer with a product not bludgeon he with chrome excess length and weight let s make it moonlight and the call of far place and a seduction at reasonable rate ticonderoga fold a few minute too soon before the tide change still honest and stupid and the network of dealer the company have be around wait to be sign up again wait for we ready-made we ve get rid of the steam yacht and georgian house and the bloated too-expensive automobile be next why not come down smartly in the world in a chic fashion with an allstates-zenith
