distractedly all about that angie know too when thing get a little out of hand they very rapidly get a lot out of hand it seem to be a general rule all just by chance and in a way trace back to poor frank all of it because naturally brother live together and angie mr skyros do not at all like the look on angelo s regular-featured almost girlishly good-looking face or indeed anything about angelo mr skyros be not a man who think very much about moral principle he find money much more interest but all the same he think now uneasily of the way in which angelo earn he live and pay for he own stuff and eye the soft smile and the spaniel-like dark eye and he feel a little ill look i friend he say in i life i learn how be it the proverb say good an ounce of prevention to a pound of cure i stay in business so long because i m careful two week a month we talk it over again and maybe if nothing happen meanwhile to say the cop know this and that then we make a little deal be nt it that s a long while say angie i tell you you want to leave it that way i do nt fool around with it i go over to castro and get fix up there i can nt wait no two week and mr skyros do nt like angie but what with prettyman and three of he boy inside and not likely to come out and angie such a valuable salesman prettyman say all the nuisance and danger of get in touch with practically a whole new bunch of boy why do everything have to happen at once denny say stupidly why you ai nt turn angie down be you mr skyros i mean we all figure i guess anybody d figure angie angelo give he an affectionate smile mr skyros too smart a fellow want to get rid of i he say it s ok denny everything s ok ai nt it mr skyros oh god the name repeat over and over anybody to hear not be a fool mr skyros know why but aside from everything else it would scarcely be pleasant to have dealing with one who be nominally an underling and actually hold you could say the whip hand and all because of domokous if mr skyros have dream of all the trouble that young man would eventually cause of course there be another factor angie worth he weight in gold right now but these user they sometimes go down fast who know angie might not last long the sweat break out on mr skyros forehead a he realize he have be actually think hope plan perhaps good god above have not domokous be enough he pat angelo s thin shoulder paternally now you do nt want to go talk that way he say sure sure you re the one take over for pretty soon a i get the supply get start up again be nt it you do nt need worry angelo i tell you i know

again standard deal mr skyros you go n have a look round for it i do i good say mr skyros earnestly just for you i friend this be awkward for everybody be nt it we all get to put up with inconvenience sometimes but i do i good for you he get out of there in a hurry brush past another man in the door mop he brow the expedient thing yes very true one must make do a one could in some situation it could all be straighten out late not very much late but when thing have settle down a little after this deal with the bouvardier woman go through an ace of spade he be not a superstitious man but he feel perhaps there be a little something in that indeed he rather wish he have never get into the business and still scarcely to be resist a nice little profit with not much work involve easy money katya roslev who would be katharine ross so very soon now ring up she first sale of the day and count back the change she do not notice that the customer seize she purchase and turn away without a smile or a word of thank usually she mark the few who do thank you you do nt get that kind much in a place like this and she play a little game with herself see how downright rude she could act to the other before they d take offense threaten to call the manager funny how seldom they do use to it probably the kind who come into a cheap store like this grab snatch i see that first and here i ll take this i be before she you wait on i now or i do nt bother with it see this kind of place she d be through here just no time at all leave this kind of thing way behind off at noon and she d never come

that place in the station where you could put thing in a locker overnight for a dime then on monday morning or it might have to be tuesday get up and leave just the usual time and last thing put the money in an envelope under the old woman s purse there in the drawer she would nt be go to get that for an hour or so after katya have leave go do the daily shop no need leave a note with it either or maybe just something like do nt worry about i i m go away to make a good life a good life escape it be nt a if she want much she do nt mind work hard not a if she figure to do anything wrong to live easy and soft all she want be a chance where she be nt mark a what she be to be katharine ross and work in a nice shop somewhere at a little more money so she could have pretty clothe and learn lady manner and all like that and get to know different people than up to now not just the one like she here with foreign-sounding name the one go to the same church and different place different job
