help when need if the dominican republic achieve free democratic government it will be due in large part to the we show of force that enable president balaguer to prevent a threaten restoration of trujillo dictatorship outwardly ciudad trujillo be calm none of the trujillo family remain mr balaguer be in control and opposition leader have no far excuse to suspect he offer of a coalition government preliminary to free election in the spring have we warship not appear off the dominican coast there be every possibility that the country would now be wrack by civil war ultimately either the trujillos would have be return to power or the conflict would have produce condition favorable to a takeover by dominican element responsive to castro in cuba within the organization of american state there may be some criticism of this unilateral american intervention which be not without risk obviously but there be no complaint from the dominican crowd which line ciudad trujillo s waterfront shout vive yankee more the we action be hail by a principal opposition leader dr juan bosch a have save many life and many trouble in the near future mr balaguer s trouble be by no mean over he will need the help of all oas member to eradicate finally the force of authoritarianism pro-trujillo and pro-castro alike in cooperate toward that objective oas might move with the speed and effectiveness demonstrate by the unite state matter of survival those watch the grow rivalry between craft union and industrial union may recognize all the pressure that lead to the big labor split in 1935 now a then it be a matter of job craft union seek work that industrial union claim such a factory maintenance the issue be sufficiently potent in 1935 to spark secession from the american federation of labor of it industrial union member that breach be heal 20 year late by merger of the american federation of labor and the congress of industrial organization or that s what it look like at the time but automation and the increase complexity of factory have renew the competition for job walter reuther leader of the industrial union faction of the afl-cio say another two year of this squabble will be disastrous for all american labor whether it could be a disastrous for american labor a say jimmy hoffa of the teamsters be a matter of conjecture but the jurisdictional dispute that result from the craft-industrial rivalry do not win friend for labor engage a it be in a battle for world trade a a condition of national survival this country can have little patience with labor s family feud the concept of labor a a special class be outmoded and in the task confront america a bastion of the free world labor must learn to put the national interest first if it be itself to survive deterrent the army navy and air force among other may question secretary freeman s claim that the high estate of unite state agriculture be the strong deterrent to the spread of communism but the secretary insist that the success of the american farmer be the great single source of strength in the struggle to insure freedom around the world mr freeman say that in many of the country he visit on a recent world trade trip people be more awe by america s capacity to produce food surpluses than by we industrial production or even by the soviet s success in space this should nt surprise the secretary american taxpayer have be impress by the surpluses for a long long time in fact over the year the american farmer s capacity to over-produce have cost the taxpayer a large dollar and thus far mr freeman have offer very little relief the 1961 feed grain program which the secretary sponsor have be declare a billion dollar fiasco in exchange for high price support grower pledge reduction in plant acreage but the farmer outsmart washington by shorten the distance between the row and pour on the fertilizer the result $ 11 billion add to the deficit in the federal budget perhaps a mr freeman say american agriculture may stop the communist but it be also swindle the american taxpayer what s wrong at state a senate subcommittee head by sen jackson of washington have be go over the state department and have reach some predictable conclusion the department need a clear sense of direction at the top and it need fewer but good people sen jackson say the subcommittee be not alone in question the effectiveness of the department president kennedy have indicate he dissatisfaction with it performance but those who would revitalize so complex an organization must first of all overcome the resistance of layer of official wed to traditional procedure suspicious of innovation and fearful of mistake nor do sen jackson discuss the delicate situation create by the presence in the white house of a corps of presidential assistant engage in the study of foreign policy this tend to create friction and confusion and have not make it easy for secretary rusk to restore vigor and initiative among he subordinate but competent observer believe he be make progress particularly toward what sen jackson list a the primary need a clear understand of where we vital national interest lie and what we must do to promote they the jackson report will provide some of the political support mr rusk will need if he be to get rid of department personnel engage a sen jackson put it in work that do not really need do mr rusk should also draw comfort from sen jackson s recommendation that congressional method of deal with national security problem be improve self-criticism be a rare but need commodity in congress bet man forecast economic activity be a hazardous undertake even for the specialist but now apparently the job of secretary of labor require that he be will to risk he reputation a a prognosticator of unemployment trend jame p mitchell when he be the head of the department promise to eat he hat if unemployment do nt drop below three million a couple of year ago he lose but settle for a cake in the shape of a fedora he successor secretary goldberg also have be guess wrong on a drop in the unemployment rate which have be hold just under 7 per cent for the last 11 month no bet man mr goldberg say he s merely put i neck out again by predict the rate will go down this month he be base he guess on new government statistics that show business have broaden it stride a new record high in personal income an increase in house start a spurt in retail sales and a gain in order for durable goods mr mitchell have an excuse for lose the steel strike last much long than he anticipate mr goldberg have less reason for miss the economy seem to be sail along on an even keel and the 1961 hurricane season and auto strike be at an end so they can nt be blame in november the odds thus appear favorable that the secretary s neck may be spare little resistance cambodia s chief of state who have be accuse of harboring communist marauder and otherwise make life miserable for neighboring south viet nam and thailand insist he would be very unhappy if communism establish it power in southeast asia but so convince of communism s inevitable triumph be prince sihanouk that he be ready to throw in the towel i have to see the fact be the way the prince put it and from that point of vantage he concede another two year of grace to nation maintain a pro-western posture prince sihanouk s power of prognostication some day may be confirm but history be not likely to praise the courage of he conviction bottom sight commerce secretary hodges seem to have be cast in the role of pacemaker for official washington s economic forecaster week ago he see a business upturn in the second quarter of this year while he colleague in the cabinet be shake they head in disagreement recently treasury secretary dillon and labor secretary goldberg fall into line with mr hodges appraisal though there have be some reluctance to do so at the white house and now mr hodges have pioneer far into the economic unknown with the announcement that he think business have stop slide and that it should start go upward from this point he be the first top administration officer to see the bottom of the slump the secretary base he assessment on the upturn in retail sales february s volume be 1 per cent above january s for the first pickup since last october although it s still 15 per cent off from february 1960 corroborate mr hodges figure be the federal reserve board s report of the large sales increase in the nation s department store for the week end march 4 in newark for example this gain be put at 26 per cent above the year-earlier level of course some of the credit for the sale boost must be give to improvement in the weather and to the fact that easter come more than two week early than in 1960 another optimistic sign this one from the labor department be the report that the long rise in unemployment compensation payment be interrupt for the first time in the week end feb 25 initial claim for jobless benefit be say to have drop by 8100 in the week end march 4 mr hodges be so hopeful over the outlook that he do nt think there will be any need of a cut in income tax well we can nt have everything prosperity for the whole nation be certainly prefer to a tax cut in new jersey too new jersey folk need not be tell of the builder s march to the sea for in a single generation he have parceled and populate mile of we shoreline and press on to develop the few open space that remain now the stone harbor bird sanctuary 31 acre of magic attraction for exotic heron be threaten but the battlefront extend far beyond we state against the dramatic fight be wage for preservation of 30 mile of cape cod shoreline the tiny tract at stone harbor may seem unimportant but interior secretary udall warn that there be a race on between those who would develop we few survive open shoreline and those who would save they for the enjoyment of all a public preserve the move for establishment of a national seashore park on 30000 acre of cape cod from provincetown to chatham be strengthen by president kennedy s interest in that area but preservation of the natural beauty of the cape be of more than regional concern for the automobile age have make it the recreation spot of people from all over the country by comparison stone harbor bird sanctuary s ally seem less formidable for aside from the audubon society they be mostly the snowy common and cattle egret and the louisiana green little blue and black-crowned heron who nest and feed there but there be hope for conservation commissioner bontempo have tag the sanctuary a the kind of place the state hope to include in it program to double it park space the desirability of preserve such place a the cape dune and stone harbor sanctuary become more apparent every year public sentiment for conserve we rich natural heritage be grow but that heritage be shrink even fast no joyride much of the glamor president kennedy s peace corps may have hold for some prospective applicant have be remove by sargent shriver the head corpsman anybody who be expect a joyride should accord to mr shriver get off the train right now first of all the recruit will have to undergo arduous school it will be a 16-hour train day then off to a remote place in an underdeveloped country where the diet culture language and live condition will be different and the pay of course will be nil despite all this the idea apparently have capture the imagination of countless youth whose parent be probably more surprise by the response than anybody else
