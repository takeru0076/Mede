early in november the cloud lift enough to carry out the assign mission and sweeney squadron put it first mark on the combat record every plane that could fly be send into the air cricket take eight ship and go south across the strait and along the north coast of mindanao to cagayan anything the enemy fly or float be he target fleischman with eight be to patrol the leyte gulf area with he main task to get any kamikaze before they get to the ship greg himself take two flight with todman lead the second to patrol and look for target of opportunity around ormoc on the east coast of leyte each plane carry two five-hundred pound bomb a weapon carrier take greg todman belton banjo ferguson and walter and the other the two mile from the bivouac area to the strip it be a rough long ride through the mud and pot hole no one have much to say the sky glower down at they there be a feel that this mission would be cancel like all the other and that this muddy wet dark world of combat would go on forever the truck drop they off at the various revetment spread through the jungle donovan snatch greg s chute from he with a belligerent motion and almost run to the plane with it he face be dark a the sky above it a he stand on the wing and wait for he pilot greg climb into the cockpit feel a if he have never be in one before but he hand and those of donovan move automatically adjust and arrange in the check-out procedure i ve get she a neat a i can donovan say a he drop the strap of the seton harness over greg s shoulder but this goddamn climate it s for carabao not airplane we ll make out do nt you worry chief greg reply wonder if he himself believe it yeah see you donovan say a he jump off the wing the expression be he trade-mark he open sesame to good luck and he prayer that pilot and plane would always return at the prearranged time greg start the engine and taxy out from the time the chock be pull until the plane be out of sight he know donovan would keep he back to the strip he wonder where the superstition have originate that it be bad luck for a crew chief to watch he plane take off on a combat mission yet long before the schedule time for return donovan would be watch for every speck in the sky greg rumble down the rough metal taxi strip and one by one the seven member of he flight fall in behind he the dark word bomb hang under each wing look large and powerful the pilot head look ridiculously small the control tower give he immediate take-off permission and the clean roar of the engine that take he off the rough strip speak well of the skill of donovan greg s mission be the last to leave and a he circle the ship off tacloban he see the cloud be drop down again to the west the dark green hill of leyte be lose in the cloud about halfway up they slope underneath he the sea be a dark and muddy gray water splash against he windshield a he lead the flight in and out of shower the metal strip they have take off from be coal black against the green jungle around it he possess the fighter pilot s horror of bad weather and instrument fly and he wonder if the ceiling do drop whether he and the other flight would be able to find they way back in this unfamiliar territory he shiver in the warm cockpit the overcast be solid above he a far a he could see there be no hole to climb through it they would have to go west through the narrow river valley that separate leyte from samar and hope that it do nt close in before they return greg push the radio button on he throttle todman let s try to go under this stuff stay in close and we ll go up the valley roger sweeney todman call back and pull he four in and slightly above greg greg take the formation wide around three a-26 attack bomber that be head north over the gulf he drop down to five hundred foot swing a little north of the city of tacloban and punch into the open that show against the mountain the valley be only a few hundred yard wide with just about room enough for a properly perform hundred-and-eighty-degree turn it be only a fifteen-minute flight but before it be through greg feel himself develop a case of claustrophobia the ceiling stay solid above they at about eight hundred foot and at time the sheer cliff seem about to close in if the other pilot be worry they do not show it the formation remain perfect when the sea be visible ahead of they the relief be a great a if the sun have come out he spread the flight out and lead they across a point of land and then down the coast although they draw light ground fire they see no sign of activity once todman think he have spot a tank and go down to investigate while greg cover he somebody beat we to it todman say over the radio a he come back up in formation visibility continue to be limit and greg be never able to get above a thousand foot it be frustrate he earphone be constantly full of the sound of enemy contact make by other flight he think once that he identify the somewhat hysterical voice of fleischman claim a kill but greg s area remain a placid a a florida dawn finally a time begin to run out he head into ormoc and glide-bombed a group of house that intelligence have think might contain japanese supply the low cloud make bomb difficult there be not enough room to make the usual vertical bomb run the accuracy be deplorable one of greg s bomb hang up and he be mile from the target before he could get rid of it only one of the flight score a direct hit and the rest blow up jungle with they load of bomb go the plane move swiftly and easily greg go up tight against the ceiling and lead they back to they pass to home mercifully it be still open like a man make a deep dive greg take full breath and plunge back into the valley he be about to make a gas check on he flight when todman s voice break in sweeneys three bogy twelve oclock level greg s eye flick up from he instrument panel he see they speck against the gray but close fast they be head straight for each other on a collision course friend or enemy the same old question and only a few second to answer it zero todman say excitedly and hopefully and then he think todman might be right he mind flick through the mental picture he have from the hour of aircraft identification he narrow the shape down to two either a zero or a we navy type aircraft if it be the enemy tactically he position be correct japanese aircraft be strong on maneuverability american on speed and firepower he present maximum altitude up against the overcast give he the opportunity to exploit he advantage but it also make he conspicuous to the enemy if it be the enemy and he have nt be spot already but the close aircraft show no sign of deviate from they original course in second greg make he decision he push the radio button sweeney blue hit the deck lot of throttle todman you take the one on the leave i ll take the middle belton the one on the right if they re jap let s make sure first greg have the stick forward and the throttle up before he hear the two rogers the plane light with most of the gas burn out respond beautifully greg s airspeed indicator be over 350 when he leveled off just above the tree the oppose aircraft continue to come on they appear to be the enemy greg wish the air corps have continue to camouflage plane there be of course no way for the other plane to get by they it be a box but they could turn and escape to the east greg push the radio button again todman drop you second element back if any of we miss they can pick up the piece now let s make sure they re jap even a he say it greg know they have find the enemy the shape be unmistakable and the rise sun be show up slightly bright pinpoint in the gray gloom greg slap he hand across the switch that turn on the gun and gun camera and gun sight the circle with the dot in the center show up yellow on the reflector glass in front of he he hand shake arm you gun sweeneys they re jap they re jap come a high-pitched voice greg to sweeney blue one pass only no turn you ll bust you ass in this canyon that s an order he move the flight over against one wall it give they all a chance to make a high-speed climb turn attack and a break-away that would not take they into the overcast or force a tight-turn recovery if the turn be too tight a barrel roll would bring they out a hell of an altitude for a barrel roll but it could be do greg slam he throttle to the fire wall and ram up the rpm and the engine respond a if it have be wait the clearly identifiable enemy continue on a if no one else be around they have nt see we greg yell to himself over the engine noise they have nt see we he hit the radio button now sweeneys now let s take em home he haul back on the stick and feel he cheek sag out of the corner of he eye he watch he wingman move out a bit and shoot up with he perfect he think with the rapid rate of closure the approach from below the side and ahead there would be only a moment when damage could be do just like shoot at a duck while perform a half-gainer from a dive board he tighten he turn he nose up it be go to be dangerous eight aircraft in this small box please dear god make i pilot good he pray he take a lead on the enemy use a distance of five of the radius in he circular sight and then add another the enemy do not veer it do not seem possible that they have nt be spot blind fool now greg s finger close on the stick trigger the plane rumble and slow six red line etch they way into the gray and vanish a if draw by a wire the enemy fly into they greg tighten he turn until the plane shudder luck be with he he burst hold for a second on the engine section of the plane the jap s propeller fly off in piece a large piece of engine cowling vanish it be all greg have time to see he maneuvering for the shoot have place he near the overcast almost invert and head up into the cloud he speed be drop rapidly if he spin out now he would join he opponent on the ground wingman stay clear he pray he push stick and rudder and enter the overcast on he back he fight the panic of vertigo he have no idea which be up and which be down he hold the control where they have be sweat pop out over he and he feel the slick between he palm and the stick grip he air speed drop until he think he would spin out
