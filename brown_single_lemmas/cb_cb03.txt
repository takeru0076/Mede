a good man depart goodby mr sam sam rayburn be a good man a good american and third a good democrat he be all of these roll into one sturdy figure mr speaker mr sam and mr democrat at one and the same time the house be he habitat and there he flourish first a a young representative then a a forceful committee chairman and finally in the post for which he seem intend from birth speaker of the house and second most powerful man in washington mr rayburn be not an easy man to classify or to label he be no flame liberal yet the new deal the fair deal and the new frontier need he he be not a rear-looking conservative yet partisan of that persuasion will miss he a much a any two of the vital quality demand of a politician by other politician be that he always keep a confidence and that he keep he word sam rayburn take unnumbered secret with he to the grave for he be never loquacious and he word once give be not subject to retraction it might be add that a he keep he word so he expect that other keep theirs the demonstration of he power be never flamboyant or theatrical he leadership be not for audience a growl a nod be usually enough when it be not one of the great drama of washington would be present he would rise in the well of the house he chin upon he chest he hand grip the side of a desk and the political and legislative chatter would subside into silence he speak briefly sensibly to the point and without oratorical flourish he make good plain american common sense and the house usually recognize it and act upon it these public effort be rare because mr rayburn normally do he counseling persuade and educate long before an issue reach it test on the house floor he expect democrat to do they duty when it have be patiently point out to they with he long service he have a long memory an excellent thing in a political leader he be of course in the house for a very long time there be only two man remain in congress who with rayburn vote for the declaration of war against germany in 1917 to almost two generation of american it must have seem a though the existence of mr sam coincide with that of the house and it be the house he love to be preside officer of it be the end of he desire and ambition the senate to he be not the upper body and he correct those who say he serve under the president he serve with he sound the roll of those with whom he serve and who precede he in death woodrow wilson with whom he begin he year in washington warren g harding calvin coolidge fdr with whom he manage a social revolution and those still with we herbert c hoover harry s truman dwight d eisenhower and john f kennedy he be a fighter for those of he own party mr truman have only to recall the hopeless campaign of 1948 to remember what a loyal partisan he be and the first experience of mr kennedy with congress would have be sad than it be have not mr sam be there a it be he absence because of he final illness be a blow to the administration with republican president he fight fair he be he own man not an automatic obstructionist he keep he attack on republicanism for partisan campaign but that be part of the game he be bear to play under any name mr speaker mr democrat mr sam he be a good man un off the congo track thirteen italian airman who go to the congo to serve the cause of peace under the unite nation banner have instead meet violent death at the hand of congolese troop supposedly they friend in 18 month no more grisly incident have be report from that jungle simply out of bloodlust they murderer dismember the body and toss the remain into the river the excuse be offer for they that they have mistake the italian for belgian mercenary in other word atrocity by savage wear the uniform of the central government might be condone have the victim be serve the cause of dissident katanga do this suggest that the congo be fit for nationhood or that un be make any progress whatever toward it goal of so make it to the contrary through the past six week violence have be pile upon violence mass rape troop mutiny uncontrolled loot and pillage and reckless military adventure give no sanction by any political authority have become almost daily occurrence yet this basic condition of outlawry and anarchy be not the work of katanga it happen in the territory of the leopoldville government which be itself a fiction demonstrably incapable of govern and command only such limit credit abroad a un support give it the main question raise by the incident be how much long will un bury it head in the sand on the congo problem instead of face the bitter fact that it have no solution in present term the probable answer be that it will do so just a long a russia can exercise a veto in favor of chaos and until young african nation wake up to the truth that out of false pride they be visit ruin on central africa right now they be push a resolution which would have un use it force to invade and subjugate katanga that notion be fantastically wrong-headed from several point of view the un army be too weak too demoralize for the task far it have it work cut out stop anarchy where it be now garrison last it make no sense to deliver katanga the one reasonably solid territory into the exist chaos the congo should have be mandate because it be not ready for independence the idea be not even suggest because political expediency prevail over wisdom it be perhaps too late now to talk of mandate because it be inconsistent with what be term political realism but if any realism and feel for truth remain in the general assembly it be time for man of courage to measure the magnitude of the failure and urge some new approach otherwise un will march blindly on to certain defeat featherbed reversal a recent editorial discuss a labor-management agreement reach between the southern pacific co and the order of railroad telegrapher have be criticize on the ground that it be not base on complete information the editorial be base on a news association dispatch which say that the telegrapher have secure an agreement whereby they be guarantee 40 hour pay per week whether they work or not and that a reduction in they number be limit to 2 per cent per year we comment be that this be featherbed in it ultimate form and that sympathy for the railroad be misplace since it have enter into such an agreement the statement be also make that undoubtedly the railroad have receive some compensate benefit from the telegrapher but that it be difficult to imagine what could balance a job for life additional information supply to we disclose that the railroad gain a stabilize supply of telegrapher of which it be in need also normal personnel attrition would make the job reduction provision more or less academic the situation with regard to the southern pacific be therefore a special one and not necessarily applicable to other situation in other industry the solution reach in the agreement be more acceptable to the railroad than that originally include in a series of union demand meditation from a fallout shelter time be when the house of delegate of the american bar association lean to the common sense side but the internationalist have take over the govern body of the bar and when the lad meet in st louis it be not to grumble about the humidity but to vote unanimously that the unite nation be scarcely less than wonderful despite an imperfection here and there it be the brief writer decide man s good hope for a peaceful and law abide world peace it s wonderful and world law it s wonderful too and should nt we get an international covenant extend it into space before the russian put some claim jumper on the moon meanwhile in moscow khrushchev be add he bit to the march of world law by promise to build a bomb with a wallop equal to 100 million ton of tnt to knock sense into the head of those backward oaf who can nt see the justice of surrender west berlin to communism a nuclear pacifier of these dimension roughly some six and a half time big than anything the unite state have trigger experimentally would certainly produce a big bang and just for kick khrushchev might use it to propel the seminar of the house of delegate from st louis to the moon where there would nt even be any beer to drink while he be at it the philosopher of the kremlin contribute an additional assist to the rule of reason by bellow at those in the west who can nt appreciate coexistence thru suicide fool he bay what do you think you be do the only response we can think of be the humble one that at least we be nt play the marimba with we shoe in the unite nation but perhaps the heavy dome in the house of delegate can improve on this feeble effort another evidence of the spread rule of reason be provide from mexico city with the daily hijack of an american plane by a demented algerian with a gun the craft make the familiar unwelcome flight to havana where for some unknown reason castro rush to the airport to express mortification to the colombian foreign minister a passenger who be not an admirer of old ten oclock shadow the plane be send back to the unite state for a change but castro keep the crazy gunman who will prove a suitable recruit to the revolution less respect for the legal convention be display by castro s right hand man che guevara who edify the inter-american economic and social council meet in montevideo by read two secret american document purloin from the unite state embassy at caracas venezuela the content be highly embarrass to american spokesman who be on hand to promise latin american a 20 billion dollar foreign aid millennium perhaps the morality of world law be not advance by steal american diplomatic paper and plane but the kennedy administration can always file a demurrer to the effect that but for it own incompetence in protect american interest these thing would not happen the same can be say about the half-hearted cuban invasion mount by the administration last april which we trust be not symptomatic of the method to be invoke in hold off the felonious khrushchev pass the iron ration please and light another candle for it s get dark down here and we re mind to read a bit of world law just to pass the time away the customer lose again the board of suspension of the interstate commerce commission have order
