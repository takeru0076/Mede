she be move through a screen of hemlock in among the white birch and maple the sound from the quarry begin to pulse in she ear she stand once more listen she have never be here at this hour she feel a if some dark totally unfamiliar shape would clutch at she arm but she find the path she always use the stub of branch she have break those she have push aside and she walk easily now and more slowly until she could see the dark glisten of water beneath she if i ever commit suicide she think i would dive straight down from here and no one would find i for day she smile and expertly let herself downward hold this know root or that she sneaker slide in the leave she jump out onto the flat expanse of rock and seat herself shake she short-cut brown hair and tilt she chin far upward the reedy music of the frog have fade but presently it begin again grow in volume until it be vibrant julia feel at peace and draw she leg up and clasp she hand tightly around the bend knee she have accomplish a miracle this be she place the hour could nt change it only only she thought be a little strange they be become confuse perhaps it be because it be so late and because she have no business to be here now she be think of paul a few week ago in the easter holiday with she at one of those awful friday even dance class party she mother have make she attend hello julie how be you and then off he go so casually to someone else with breast good develop more obvious in a lower-cut dress someone without a mouthful of wire band and an inability to find word that would hold he i wish he be with i now she think and that we be both the age we be and do what be once only pretense and acute embarrassment oh god i wish i be old or young julia bentley think i wish so much someone love i george rawling remember see the door open sometime during the night millie in a white robe stand like a ghost at the threshold she have vanish he must have sleep again he be stare at the blue china lamp leave on beside he it seem too much trouble even to reach for the switch but of course the impossible effort of leave would have to be make on this monday morning this room be like a prison he would not be indebted to sam below he a if at the end of some remote tunnel he hear the hum of a vacuum clean he finger fumble across the bandage they have leave both of he eye uncover well he tell himself let s put the show on the road he be walk across to the bathroom he drink a glass of water and grip the sink with both hand a fearful pain have come from he head a if the water be course up through the blood vessel and expand they he recognize he jacket and trousers the fabric be dark the stain be nt too apparent and there be he shoe thank god but he shirt be one terrible mess he shiver and then tear away the blood-soaked part and wind the rest around he neck like a scarf sam would be amaze to find he go millie would have to understand she must have put he clothe in the closet he find a lump rise in he throat because of that one simple act of tidiness he be on the verge of tear alex poldowski in a fashion he owe a debt to that effete gentleman at least alex have tell he he be nt die perhaps george rawling would be good off dead what time be it he peer at he wristwatch strange it be still run a quarter to seven too early for a vacuum clean but probably sam want the whole house in order before he come downstairs he be kneel to tie he shoelace he finger feel absurdly thick and clumsy he rise slowly and look into the mirror on the inside of the closet door he barely know himself this be some freak two strand of adhesive tape across he nose like ugly root from the mass of gauze suddenly moist over he cheekbone the surface however be perfectly white he be drink another glass of water it be after seven oclock he be suppose to be in court this afternoon at city hall who would take over he d have to think but the main thing the imperative necessity be to leave before sam bentley be up and about and before millie detain he with sympathy he enter the hallway he be actually walk down the stairs a plane up in the sky above the cloud and this freakish wreck of a man desperately try to get away father be that you the voice issue from the cavern of the hall below george do not reply be that you father who s there for a moment he feel like a thief discover then julia appear under the arch lead to the dine room she stand gaze at he uncle george he be try to smile at she gosh you should nt be up should you i i be just leave here julie i m all set just about to

sophisticate considerate and yet perhaps partly scornful he try to see she face more clearly no nothing at all he say after a moment s hesitation i ll just wait for you here he lean he head against the wood paneling behind he but the vivid red image of pain insert themselves against he eyelid he raise they julia move past i have to say good-bye upstairs i will nt be long a a great favor julie he

hardly believe he be get in pietro be gaze at he in an insolent disdainful fashion but that do nt matter we ll drop mr rawling off in ardmore julia say and for the mere second george be remind of she father s tone with servant to the manner bear odd to have such a think at a time like this yet she inflection seem force or rehearse he could not stop to analyze he have never feel particularly close to she carrie seem more affectionate but obviously julia have respect he request he take she hand i wish i do nt have to go back to school she say and then i wish you live in new york that s in the opposite direction i wish i do he respond i wish i be nt wear this ridiculous costume and that we could go to a theater together or a nice restaurant forget we know he stop speak forget we ever know
