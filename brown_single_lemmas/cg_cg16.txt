the reality to which they respond be rationally empty and they art be an imitation of the inescapable powerfulness of this unknown and empty world they artistic rationale be give to the witness of unreason these polar concern imitation vs formalism reflect a philosophical and religious situation which have be develop over a long period of time the breakdown of classical structure of mean in all realm of western culture have give rise to several generation of artist who have document the disintegrative process thus the image of man have suffer complete fragmentation in personal and spiritual quality and complete objectification in sub-human and quasi-mechanistic power the image of the world tend to reflect the hostility and indifference of man or else to dissolve into empty space and overwhelming mystery the image of god have simply disappear all such imitation of negative quality have give rise to a compensatory response in the form of a heroic and highly individualistic humanism if man can neither know nor love reality a it be he can at least invent an artistic reality which be it own world and which can speak to man of purely personal and subjective quality capable of be know and worthy of be love the person of the artist become a final bastion of mean in a world render meaningless by the march of event and the decay of classical religious and philosophical system whatever pole of this contrast one emphasize and whatever the tension between these two approach to understand the artistic imagination it will be readily see that they be not mutually exclusive that they belong together without the decay of a sense of objective reference except a the imitation of mystery the stress on subjective invention would never have be stimulate into be and although these insight into the nature of art may be in themselves insufficient for a thoroughgoing philosophy of art they peculiar authenticity in this day and age require that they be take seriously and give promise that from they very substance new and valid chapter in the philosophy of art may be write for good or bad we can not regard imitation in the art in the simple mode of classical rationalism or detach realism a broad concept of imitation be need one which acknowledge that true invention be important that the artist s creativity in part transcend the non-artistic causal factor out of which it arise on the other hand we can not regard artistic invention a pure uncaused and unrelated to the time in which it occur we need a doctrine of imitation to save we from the solipsism and futility of pure formalism accordingly it be the aim of this essay to advance a new theory of imitation which i shall call mimesis in order to distinguish it from early theory of imitation and a new theory of invention which i shall call symbol for reason to be state hereafter the mimetic imagination in the art the word mimesis imitation be usually associate with plato and aristotle for plato imitation be twice remove from reality be a poor copy of physical appearance which in itself be a poor copy of ideal essence all artistic and mythological representation therefore be imitation of imitation and be completely supersede by the truth value of dialectic the proper use of the inquire intellect in plato s judgment the art play a meaningful role in society only in the education of the young prior to the full development of they intellectual power presuppose in plato s system be a doctrine of level of insight in which a certain kind of detach understand be alone capable of penetrate to the most sublime wisdom aristotle also tend to stratify all aspect of human nature and activity into level of excellence and like plato he put the pure and unimpassioned intellect on the top level the poetic in affirm that all human art be mode of imitation give a more serious role to artistic mimesis than do plato but aristotle keep the principle of level and even augment it by describe in the poetic what kind of character and action must be imitate if the play be to be a vehicle of serious and important human truth for both plato and aristotle artistic mimesis in contrast to the power of dialectic be relatively incapable of express the character of fundamental reality the central concern of erich auerbach s impressive volume call mimesis be to describe the shift from a classic theory of imitation base upon a recognition of level of truth to a christian theory of imitation in which the level be dissolve follow the theme of incarnation in the gospel the christian artist and critic see in the most commonplace and ordinary event figure of divine power and reality here artistic realism involve the audience in an impassioned participation in event whose overtone and implication be transcendent artistic mimesis under christian influence record the involvement of all person however humble in a divine drama the artist unlike the philosopher be not a remove observer aim at neutral and rarify high level of abstraction he be the conveyor of a sacred reality by which he have be grasp i have choose to use the word mimesis in it christian rather than it classic implication and to discover in the concrete form of both art and myth power of theological expression which a in the christian mind be the direct consequence of involvement in historical experience which be not reserve a in the greek mind only to moment of theoretical reflection in the first instance mimesis be here use to mean the recall of experience in term of vivid image rather than in term of abstract idea or conventional designation by image be mean not only a visual presentation but also remember sensation of any of the five sense plus the feeling which be immediately conjoin therewith this be the primary function of the imagination operate in the absence of the original experiential stimulus by which the image be first appropriate mimesis be the near possible thing to the actual re-live of experience in which the imagine person recover through image something of the force and depth characteristic of experience itself the image themselves like they counterpart in experience be not neutral quality to be survey dispassionately they be field of force exert a unique influence on the sensibility and a unique relatedness to one another they bring an inextricable component of value within themselves with attraction and repulsion native to they own quality a in experience one be seize by give entity and they interrelation and be force to respond in value feeling to they so one be similarly seize in the mimetic presentation of image mimesis here be not to be confuse with literalism or realism in the conventional sense a word take in it dictionary mean a photographic image of a recognizable object the mere picture of a scene tend to lose experiential vividness and to connote such conventional abstraction a to invite neutral reception without the incitement of value feeling similarly experience itself can be conventionalized so that people react to certain preconceived clue for behavior without awareness of the vitality of they experiential field a truly vivid imagination move beyond the conventional recollection to a sense of immediacy the mimetic character of the imaginative consciousness tend to express itself in the presentation of artistic form and material when word can be use in a more fresh and primitive way so that they strike with the force of sight and sound when tone of sound and color of paint and the carven shape all strike the sensibility with an undeniable force of data in and of themselves compel the observer into an attitude of attention all this imitate the way experience itself in it deep character strike upon the door of consciousness and clamors for entrance these be like the initial way in which the world force itself upon the self and thrust the self into decision and choice the presence of genuine mimesis in art be mark by the persistence with which the work demand attention and compel valuation even though it be but vaguely understand underlie these conception of mimesis be certain presupposition concern the nature of primary human experience which require some exposition before the main argument can proceed experience be not see a it be in classical rationalism a present we initially with clear and distinct object simply locate in space and register they character movement and change on the tabula rasa of an uninvolved intellect neither be primary experience understand accord to the attitude of modern empiricism in which nothing be think to be receive other than signal of sensory quality produce they response in the appropriate sense organ primary feeling of the world come neither a a collection of clearly know object house tree implement etc nor a collection of isolate and neutral sensory quality in contrast to all this primary data be data of a self involve in environing process and power the most primitive feeling be rudimentary value feeling both positive and negative a desire to appropriate this or that part of the environment into oneself a desire to avoid and repel this or that other part these desire presuppose a sense of causally efficacious power in which one be involve some work for one s good other threaten ill go be the tabula rasa of the mind in it place be a passionate consciousness grasp and mold to feeling of positive or negative value even a the action of one s life be determine by constellation of process in which one be catch the principal defender of this view of primary experience a causal efficacy be alfred north whitehead we most elemental and unavoidable impression he say be those of be involve in a large arena of power which have a long past than we own which be interrelate in a vast movement through the present toward the future we feel the quality of these power initially a in some degree wholesome or threaten late abstractive and rational process may indicate error of judgment in these apprehension of value but the apprehension themselves be the primary stuff of experience it take a great deal of abstraction to free oneself from the primitive impression of large unity of power and influence and to view one s world simply a a collection of sense data arrange in such and such sequence and pattern devoid of all power to move the feeling and action except in so far a they present themselves for inspection whitehead be here question david hume s understand of the nature of experience he be question also every epistemology which stem from hume s presupposition that experience be merely sense data in abstraction from causal efficacy and that causal efficacy be something intellectually impute to the world not directly perceive what hume call sensation be what whitehead call perception in the mode of presentational immediacy which be a sophisticate abstraction from perception in the mode of causal efficacy a long a perception be see a compose only of isolate sense data most of the quality and interconnectedness of existence lose it objectivity become an invention of consciousness and the result be a philosophical scepticism whitehead contend that the human way of understand existence a a unity of interlocking and interdependent process which constitute each other and which cause each other to be and not to be be possible only because the basic form of such an understand for all it vagueness and tendency to mistake the detail be initially give in the way man feel the world in this respect experience be broad and full of a rich variety of potential meaning than the mind of man or any of he art or culture be capable of make clear and distinct a chief characteristic of experience in the mode of causal efficacy be one of derivation from the past both i and i feeling come up out of a chain of event that fan out into the past into source that be ultimately very unlike the entity which i now be
