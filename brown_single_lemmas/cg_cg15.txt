it be worth dwelling in some detail on the crisis of this story because it bring together a number of characteristic element and make of they a curious riddle compound obscurely but centrally significant for mann s work the wife amra and she lover be both savagely portray she a incarnate sensuality voluptuous and indolent possibly a mischief maker with a kind of luxurious cunning to set against she apparent simplicity she birdlike brain lautner for he part belong to the present-day race of small artist who do not demand the utmost of themselves and the bitter description of the type include such epithet a wretched little poseur the devastate indictment they do not know how to be wretched decently and in order and the somewhat extreme prophecy so far not fulfil they will be destroy the trick these two play upon jacoby reveal they want not simply of decency but of imagination a well he appearance a lizzy evoke not amusement but horror in the audience it be a spectacle absolutely painful an epiphany of the suffer flesh unredeemed by spirit untouched by any spirit other than abasement and humiliation at the same time the multiple transvestitism involve the fat man a girl and a baby a coquette pretend to be a baby touch for a moment horrifyingly upon the secret source of a life like jacoby s upon the sinister dream which form the source of any human life the music which lautner have compose for this episode be for the most part rather pretty and perfectly banal but it be characteristic of he we be tell he little artifice to be able to introduce into a fairly vulgar and humorous piece of hackwork a sudden phrase of genuine creative art and this occur now at the refrain of jacoby s song at the point in fact of the name lizzy a modulation describe a almost a stroke of genius a miracle a revelation it be like a curtain suddenly tear away to reveal something nude it be this modulation which reveal to jacoby he own frightful abjection and simultaneously he wife s infidelity by the same mean he perceive this fact a have communicate itself to the audience he collapse and die in the work of every artist i suppose there may be find one or more moment which strike the student a absolutely decisive ultimately emblematic of what it be all about not less strikingly so for be mysterious a though some deeply hide constatation of thought be enciphered in a single image a single moment so here the horrifying humor the specifically sexual embarrassment of the joke go wrong the monstrous image of the fat man dress up a a whore dress up a a baby the epiphany of that quiver flesh the bring together around it of the secret liaison between indolent mindless sensuality and sharp shrewd talent cleverness with an occasional touch of genius which however do not know how to attack the problem of suffer the miraculous way in which music revelation and death be associate in a single instant all this seem a triumph of art a rather desperate art in itself beyond itself also it evoke numerous and distant resonance from the entire body of mann s work when i try to work out i reason for feel that this passage be of critical significance i come up with the follow idea which i shall express very briefly here and revert to in a late essay love be the crucial dilemma of experience for mann s hero the dramatic construction of he story characteristically turn on a situation in which someone be simultaneously compel and forbid to love the release the freedom involve in love another be either terribly difficult or else absolutely impossible and the motion toward it bring disaster this prohibition on love have an especially poignant relation to art it be particularly the artist tonio kroger aschenbach leverkuhn who suffer from it the specific analogy to the dilemma of love be the problem of the breakthrough in the realm of art again the suffering and disaster produce by any transgression against the commandment not to love be almost invariably associate in one way or another with childhood with the figure of a child finally the theatrical and perversely erotic notion of dress up cosmetic disguise and especially change of costume or singularity of costume a with cipolla be characteristically associate with the catastrophe of mann s story we shall return to these statement and deal with they more fully a the evidence for they accumulate for the present it be enough to note that in the grotesque figure of jacoby at the moment of he collapse all these element come together in prophetic parody professionally a lawyer that be to say associate with dignity reserve discipline with much that be essentially middle-class he be compel by an impossible love to exhibit himself dress up disguise that be paradoxically reveal a a child and bad a a whore masquerade a a child that this abandonment take place on a stage during an artistic performance be enough to associate jacoby with art and to bring down upon he the punishment for art that be he be suspect guilty punishable a be anyone in mann s story who produce illusion and this be true even though the constant element of the artist-nature technique magic guilt and suffer be divide in this story between jacoby and lautner it appear that the dominant tendency of mann s early tale however pictorial or even picturesque the surface be already toward the symbolic the emblematic the expressionistic in a certain perfectly definite way the method and the theme of he story be one and the same something of this can be learn from the way to the churchyard 1901 an anecdote about an old failure whose fit of anger at a pass cyclist cause he to die of a stroke or seizure there be no more plot than that only slightly more perhaps than a newspaper account of such an incident would give the artistic interest then lie in what the encounter may be make to represent in the power of some central significance to draw the detail into relevance and meaningfulness the first sentence with it platitudinous irony announce an emblematic intent the way to the churchyard run along beside the highroad run beside it all the way to the end that be to say to the churchyard and the action be consistently present with regard for this distinction the highroad one might say at first belong to life while the way to the churchyard belong to death but that be too simple and will nt hold up a the first sentence suggest both road belong to death in the end but the highroad accord to the description of it traffic belong to life a it be live in unawareness of death while the way to the churchyard belong to some other sort of life a suffer form an existence wholly comprise in the awareness of death thus on the highroad a troop of soldier march in they own dust and sing while on the footpath one man walk alone this man s isolation be not merely momentary it be permanent he be a widower he three child be dead he have no one leave on earth also he be a drink and have lose he job on that account he name be praisegod piepsam and he be rather fully describe a to he clothing and physiognomy in a way which relate he to a sinister type in the author s repertory he be a forerunner of those enigmatic stranger in death in venice for example who represent some combination of cadaver exotic and psychopomp this strange person quarrel with a cyclist because the latter be use the path rather than the highroad the cyclist a sufficiently commonplace young fellow be not name but identify simply a life that and a license number which piepsam use in address he life point out that everybody use this path and start to ride on piepsam try to stop he by force receive a push in the chest from life and be leave stand in impotent and grow rage while a crowd begin to gather he rage assume a religious form that be on the basis of he own sinfulness and abject wretchedness piepsam become a prophet who in he ecstasy and in the name of god imprecates doom on life not only the cyclist now but the audience the world a well all you light-headed breed this passion bring on a fit which prove fatal then an ambulance come along and they drive praisegod piepsam away this be simple enough but several more point of interest may be mention a relevant the season between spring and summer belong to life in it carefree aspect piepsam s fatal rage arise not only because he can not stop the cyclist but also because god will not stop he a piepsam say to the crowd in he last moment he justice be not of this world life be far characterize in antithesis to piepsam a animal the image of a dog which appear at several place be first give a the criterion of amiable irrelevant interest arouse by life consider simply a a spectacle a dog in a wagon be admirable a pleasure to contemplate another wagon have no dog and therefore be devoid of interest piepsam call the cyclist cur and puppy among other thing and at the crisis of he fit a little fox-terrier stand before he and howl into he face the ambulance be draw by two charm little horse piepsam be not certainly religious in any conventional sense he religiousness be intimately or dialectically connect with he sinfulness the two may in fact be identical he unsuccessful striving to give up drink be represent a religious striving he keep a bottle in a wardrobe at home and before this wardrobe praisegod piepsam have before now go literally on he knee and in he wrestling have bitten he tongue and still in the end capitulate the cyclist by contrast blond and blue-eyed be simply unreflective unproblematic life blithe and carefree he make no claim to belong to the great and mighty of this earth piepsam be grotesque a disturb parody he end be ridiculous and trivial he be a man rave mad on the way to the churchyard but he be more interest than the other the one who come from the highroad to watch he more interest than life consider a a cyclist and if i have go into so much detail about so small a work that be because it be also so typical a work represent the germinal form of a conflict which remain essential in mann s write the crude sketch of piepsam contain in it critical destructive and self-destructive tendency much that be enlarge and illuminate in the figure of for instance naphta and leverkuhn in method a well a in theme this little anecdote with it detail select a much for expressiveness and allegory a for realism anticipate a kind of musical composition a well a a kind of fictional composition in which a leverkuhn say there shall be nothing unthematic it resemble too picture such a durer and bruegel do in which all that look at first to be solely pictorial prove on inspection to be also literary the representation of a proverb for example or a deadly sin gladius dei 1902 resemble the way to the churchyard in it representation of a conflict between light and dark between life and a spirit of criticism negation melancholy but it go considerably far in characterize the element of this conflict the monk savonarola bring over from the renaissance and place against the background of munich at the turn of the century protest against the luxurious work display in the art-shop of m bluthenzweig in particular against a madonna portray in a voluptuous style and modele accord to gossip upon the painter s mistress hieronymus like piepsam make he protest quite in vain and he rejection though not fatal be ridiculous and humiliate he be simply throw out of the shop by the porter on the street outside hieronymus envision a holocaust of the vanity of this world such a burn of artistic and erotic production a he namesake actually bring to pass in florence and prophetically he issue he curse gladius dei super terram cito et velociter
