so far these remark like most criticism of hardy have tacitly assume that he poetry be all of a piece one solid mass of verse express a sensibility at a single stage of development for critic hardy have have no poetic period one do not speak of early hardy or late hardy or of the london or max gate period but simply of hardy a of a poetic monolith this seem odd when one recall that he write poetry long than any other major english poet domicilium be date between 1857 and 1860 see the moon rise be date august 1927 one might expect that in a poetic career of seventy-odd year some change in style and method would have occur some development take place this be not however the case and development be a term which we can apply to hardy only in a very limit sense in a time when poetic style and poetic belief a well seem in a state of continual flux hardy stand out a a poet of almost perverse consistency though he struggle with philosophy all he life he never get much beyond the pessimism of he twenties the sober opinion of he letter to noye write when hardy be eighty year old be essentially that of he first philosophical notebook entry make when he be twenty-five the world do not despise we it only neglect we early life p 63 and though in he late year he revise he poem many time the revision do not alter the essential nature of the style which he have establish before he be thirty so that while it usually be easy to recognize a poem by hardy it be difficult to date one there be only one sense in which it be valid to talk about hardy s development he do develop toward a more consistent and more effective control of that tone which we recognize a uniquely he there be only one hardy style but in the early poem that style be only intermittently evident and when it be not the style be the style of another poet or of the fashion of the time in the late poem however the personal tone predominate the bad early poem be bad shakespeare or bad swinburne the bad late poem be bad hardy there be two way of get at a poet s development through he date poem and through the revision which he make in late edition of he work about a quarter of hardy s poem carry an append date line usually the year of completion but sometimes inclusive year 1908 - 1910 or two separate date when hardy work on the poem 1905 and 1926 or an approximate date during the war these date be virtually the only clue we have to the chronology of the poem since the separate volume be neither chronological within themselves nor in relation to each other with the exception of satire of circumstance each volume contain date poem range over several decade winter word span sixty-one year the internal organization rarely have any chronological order except in obvious group like the poem of pilgrimage the poem of 1912 - 13 and the war poem from the date poem we can venture certain conclusion about hardy s career in poetry always remember that conclusion base on a fraction of the whole must remain tentative the date poem suggest that while hardy s concern with poetry may have be constant he production be not he have two productive period one in the late 1860 s the other in the decade from 1910 to 1920 half of the date poem be from the latter period and these alone total about one-tenth of all hardy s poem there be one sterile period only one poem be date between 1872 and 1882 and except for the poem write on the trip to italy in 1887 very few from 1882 to 1890 the date poem also give we an idea of the degree to which hardy draw upon past production for he various volume and therefore probably be an indication of the amount of poetry he be write at the time poem of the past and the present and time s laugh stock both publish while hardy be at work on the dynast draw heavily on poem write before 1900 satire of circumstance and moment of vision come during he most productive decade be relatively self-contained the former contain no poem date before 1909 - 10 that be no poem from a period cover by a previous volume and the latter have only a few such the last three volume be again more dependent on the past a hardy s creative power decline in he old age these observation about hardy s productivity tally with the detail of he life a we know they the first productive period come when he be consider poetry a a vocation before he have decide to write fiction for a live in he note for who s who he write that he write verse 1865 - 1868 give up verse for prose 1868 - 70 but resume it late during the poetically sterile year he be write novel at the rate of almost one a year and be in addition burden with bad health he spend six month in bed in 1881 too ill to do more than work slowly and painfully at a laodicean two entry in the early life support the assumption that during this period hardy have virtually suspend the write of poetry mrs hardy record that at the end of november 1881 he make a note of an intention to resume poetry a soon a possible early life p 188 and on christmas day 1890 hardy write while think of resume the viewless wing of poesy before dawn this morning new horizon seem to open and worry pettinesses to disappear early life p 302 there be more poem date in the 1890 s than in the 80s hardy have apparently resume the viewless wing a he decrease the volume of he fiction but none in 1891 the year of tess and only one in 1895 the year of jude after 1895 the number increase and in the next thirty year there be only one year for which there be no date poem 1903 when hardy be at work on the dynast the second productive period the decade from 1910 to 1920 can be relate to three event the completion of the dynast in 1909 which leave hardy free of pressure for the first time in forty year the death of emma hardy in 1912 which have a profound emotional effect on hardy for which he find release in poetry and the first world war it may seem strange that a poet should come to full fruition in he seventies but we have it on hardy s own authority that he be a child till he be sixteen a youth till he be five-and-twenty and a young man till he be nearly fifty early life p 42 we may carry this sequence one step far and say that at seventy he be a poet at the height of he power want only the impetus of two tragedy one personal the other national to loose those power in poetry hardy s two productive decade be separate by forty year yet between they he develop only in that he become more steadily himself it be a narrow not an expand process like a wise gardener hardy prune away the shakespearian sonnet and song and the element of meter and poetic diction to which he personal style be not suit and let the main stock of he talent flourish the range of the late poetry be considerably narrow but the number of successful poem be far great we can see the general characteristic of the early decade if we look at two poem of very different quality revulsion 1866 and neutral tone 1867 there be not much to be say for revulsion like about half of the 1860 - 70 poem it be a sonnet on a conventional theme the unhappiness of love almost anyone could have write it it be competent in the sense that it make a coherent statement without violate the rule of the sonnet form but it be entirely undistinguished and entirely unlike hardy the language be the conventional language of the form there be no phrase or image that sound like hardy or that be strike enough to give individuality to the poem it be smooth than hardy usually be but with the smoothness of anonymity it be obviously a young man s poem write out of book and not out of experience it assert emotion without evoke it that be to say it be sentimental there be many such competently anonymous performance among the early poem neutral tone we immediately recognize a a fine poem in hardy s most characteristic style the plain but not quite colloquial language the hard particular colorless image the slightly odd stanza-form the dramatic handle of the occasion the refusal to resolve the issue all these we have see in hardy s good poem the poem do not distort the syntax of ordinary speech nor draw on exotic source of diction yet it be obviously not ordinary speech only hardy would say a grin of bitterness sweep thereby like an ominous bird a-wing or wring with wrong or would describe a winter sun a god-curst the detail of the set of neutral tone be not strictly speak metaphorical but they combine to create a mood which be appropriate both to a dismal winter day and to the end of love and in this way love and weather the emotion and the element symbolize each other in a way that be common to many of hardy s good poem weather the darkling thrush and during wind and rain for example and to some move passage in the novel a well far from the mad crowd be full of scene construct in this way neutral tone be an excellent example of hardy s mature style draw from he early productive period i cite it a evidence that he do not develop through new style a he grow old a yeats do but that he simply learn to use good what he already have in the poem we recognize and acknowledge one man s sense of the world if it be somber it be also precise and the precision lend authority to the vision in revulsion on the other hand the pessimism be a case not prove the poem offer nothing to persuade we of the speaker s right to speak a he do in the 1860 - 70 decade there be many poem like revulsion but there be only one neutral tone hardy be not hardy very often the poem of 1912 - 13 offer a good example of hardy s style a it be manifest in the late productive decade these be the poem hardy write after the death of he first wife they compose a painful elegy to what might have be to a marriage that begin with a promise of happiness and end in long year of suffer and hatred hardy obviously feel that these poem be peculiarly personal and private he sometimes call they an expiation and he would not allow they to be publish in periodical they be the only poem that he rearrange a a group between they first appearance in satire of circumstance and the publication of the collect poem the elegiac tone be hardy s natural tone of voice and it be not surprise that the 1912 - 13 poem be consistently and unmistakably he the view be always toward the past but the mood be not quite nostalgic hardy would not allow sentiment to soften he sense of the irredeemable pastness of the past and the eternal deadness of the dead the poem be the epigraph tell we the trace of an ancient flame the fire of love be dead and hardy stand a the speaker do in the last poem of the sequence over the burn circle of char stick and think of past happiness and present grief honest and uncomforted
