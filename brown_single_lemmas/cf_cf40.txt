in the final account these would have augment the bill for both side an estimate of one million dollar be probably not excessive yet the huge amount of money consume by the selden litigation which many regard a wasteful indirectly contribute to constructive change in legal procedure the duration and other circumstance of the selden case make it a flagrant example of the gross abuse of patent infringement action the suit a we have see come before the court when patent attorney inventor and layman be make mount demand for reform in the american patent system chief among the defect they single out be the complicate and wearisome procedure in equity in a long and angry footnote to he opinion judge hough have lend the weight of judicial condemnation to such criticism it be a duty say hough not to let pass this opportunity of protest against the method of take and print testimony in equity current in this circuit and probably other excuse if not justify by the rule of the supreme court especially to be find in patent cause and flagrantly exemplify in this litigation a long a the bar prefer to adduce evidence by write deposition rather than viva voce before an authoritative judicial officer i fear that the antiquated rule will remain unchanged and expensive prolixity remain the good know characteristic of equity observe that reform sometimes begin with the contemplation of horrible example hough catalogue the many abuse encourage by exist procedure he cite the elephantine dimension of the selden case record the duplication of testimony and exhibit the numerous squabble over minor matter the objection state at outrageous length and the frequent and rancorous verbal bout uncalled for and unjustifiable from the retort discourteous to the lie direct the fundamental difficulty of which the selden case be a strike though not singular example conclude hough will remain a long a testimony be take without any authoritative judicial officer present and responsible for the maintenance of discipline and the reception or exclusion of testimony not least among the member of the patent bar who echo this powerful indictment be those who have participate in the selden suit william a red assert that if the case have be hear in open court under rule of evidence the testimony would have be complete in sixty day instead of five year inventor join lawyer in the clamor for reform inevitably center upon the selden litigation a a horrible example it costive deliberation be liken to those of the british court of chancery mercilessly caricature by dicken in bleak house parker who agree with much of this criticism do not conceal he dissatisfaction with procedural defect but he feel that the selden case be be unfairly pillory in a detail letter publish in the scientific american in 1912 he remark that loose statement about the case show scant understand of the fact the suit although commonly designate a a single action actually embrace five case parker insist that the size of the record would have be drastically reduce but for an unavoidable duplication of testimony in a private communication write in 1911 parker have be more to the point note the complaint of inventor and member of the patent bar he admit that some of the stricture be fairly well found but he add that under exist rule the court could not consolidate testimony in a group of suit involve separate infringement of the same patent the vast industrial interest catch up in the selden suit a well a the complex character of the automotive art encourage both side to exploit every possible chance for or against the patent say parker this very seldom happen in this class or in other case and of course all of these matter lead to a volume and an expense of the record beyond what ordinarily would occur parker list the remedy he deem essential for reduce the cost and mass of testimony the most important of these find he in agreement with hough s plea for reform parker call for abolition of the indiscriminate or uncontrolled right of take deposition before officer of the court who have no authority to limit testimony the take of deposition he suggest should be place under a special court examiner empower to compel responsive and relevant answer and to exclude immaterial testimony i be satisfy that in the selden case have this power exist and this course be pursue it would have shorten the deposition of some of the expert nearly one-half and of some of the other witness thereto more than that in the end hough s acidulous protest which parker call the now somewhat famous note on this selden case do not go unheeded in 1912 the unite state supreme court adopt a new set of rule of equity which become effective on february 1 1913 the revise procedure be acclaim a a long-overdue reform under the new rule testimony be take orally in open court in all case except those of an extraordinary character other expeditious method be design to prevent prolixity limit delay and reduce the expense of infringement suit one of the alam lawyer observe that if the selden case have be try under this simplify procedure the testimony which fill more than a score of volume at a minimum cost of $ 1 a page for publication alone could have be contain in one volume while patent suit be still among the most complex and expensive form of litigation these rule have save litigant uncounted sum of money there be little doubt that they be promulgate by the supreme court a a direct result of the selden patent suit 3 even before it be formally dissolve in 1912 the alam be succeed by the automobile board of trade the direct lineal ancestor of the present-day automobile manufacturer association the trade body which come in the wake of the alam be more representative for they never adopt a policy of exclusion nevertheless it be from the selden organization that the industry inherit it institutional machinery for further the broad interest of the trade one of the chief feature of this community of interest be the automotive patent cross-licensing agreement a milestone in the development of american industrial cooperation it origin lie in the selden patent controversy and it aftermath from the early day of the motor car industry before the alam be establish patent infringement loom a a serious and vex problem many patent contest be wage over automobile component and accessory among they tire detachable rim ball bearing license bracket and electric horn the fluidity and momentum of the young industry abet a general disregard of patent claim a early a 1900 a wall street combination acquire detail patent with the intention of exact heavy tribute from automobile manufacturer this scheme fail and the follow decade bring a deluge of infringement suit among individual manufacturer that reach it crest in 1912 in this tangle of conflict claim the patent-sharing scheme adopt by the alam at it found prove to be the good device for avoid or mitigate the burden of incessant litigation the interchange of shop license for a nominal royalty eliminate infringement suit among the member of the alam patent pool although it do not protect they against outside action and keep open channel for the cross-fertilization of automotive technology one of the condition of the pool be a prohibition upon the withhold of patent right among alam member within it limit this arrangement have the actual or potential characteristic of a cross-licensing agreement it positive feature outweigh the fact that the pool be an adjunct of a wouldbe monopoly since the alam holding embrace only about twenty-five per cent of motor vehicle patent the denial of right to independent company do not retard technical progress in unlicensed sector of the industry the highly important dyer patent on the slide gear transmission be hold by the alam pool but henry ford use the planetary transmission in he model t and early car and in 1905 a a precautionary measure take out a license from the man who claim to be it inventor for those affiliate with it the alam pool be a haven from the infringement action involve detail patent that beset the industry with mount intensity after 1900 by 1910 the court be crowd with case many of they bring by freebooter who traffick in dispute invention it be commonplace for auto maker parts-suppliers and dealer to find warn notice and threat of infringement suit in they daily mail purely from the business man s standpoint and without regard to the lawyer s view comment a trade journal the matter of patent in the automobile and accessory trade be develop some phase and result that challenge think a to how far patent be to become weapon of warfare in business instead of simple beneficient protection device for encourage inventive creation occasionally new enterprise be discourage by the almost certain prospect of legal complication one manufacturer who hold an allegedly basic patent say i would readily put over $ 50000 into the manufacture of the device but it be so easy to make that we would enter immediately into a prolong ordeal of patent litigation which would eat up all we profit the prevail view in the industry be sum up in 1912 by a group of auto maker who tell a senate committee the exceedingly unsatisfactory and uselessly expensive condition include delay surround legal dispute particularly in patent litigation be item of industrial burden which must be write large in figure of many millions of dollar of industrial waste by that time it be commonly agree that patent warfare be sap constructive achievement and block the free exchange of technical information at this point charles c hanch long an advocate of patent peace in the industry become chairman of the patent committee of the national automobile chamber of commerce successor to the automobile board of trade hanch be treasurer of the nordyke & marmon company an indianapolis firm which have manufacture flour-milling machinery before produce the marmon car in 1904 he have first-hand knowledge of the patent war which have drive about ninety per cent of the mill equipment maker out of business in the mid-1890 s anxious to avoid a similar debacle in the motor car industry hanch go to detroit in 1909 to enlist the support of lead alam member for an industry-wide patent-sharing plan the breach create by the selden patent doom he proposal but hanch do not abandon he scheme after the demise of the alam the time be propitious for establish such a pool most manufacturer be now dispose to heed a proposal for the formal interchange of patent it be a much easy course to agree to let one another alone so far a ordinary patent be concern say a trade authority than to continue the costly effort of straighten the tangle in the court or seek to reform the patent system which appear to be get into deep confusion every day with the other member of the patent committee wilfred c leland howard e coffin windsor t white and wh vandervoort hanch draft a cross-licensing agreement whose essential feature of royalty-free license be he own contribution the plan be support by frederick p fish counsel for the national automobile chamber of commerce it will be recall that in he summation for the alam before judge hough fish have condemn patent litigation a the curse of the american industrial community he be well aware that some inventor and they ally use they patent solely for nuisance value i personal view be that not one patent invention in ten be worth make he late tell a congressional committee the eloquent persuasion of fish guarantee the adoption of the plan by the member of the automotive trade association draw up in 1914 the cross-licensing agreement become effective in 1915 it remain in force for ten year and have be renew at five-year interval since 1925
