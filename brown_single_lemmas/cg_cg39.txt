american-negro suite and say of it of all the many song write by white composer and employ what claim to be a negroid idiom in both word and music these six song by harold arlen and ted koehler easily stand far out above the rest thoroughly modern in treatment they be at the same time full of simple sincerity which invariably characterize genuine negro folk-music and be by no mean to be confuse with the average broadway spiritual which depend for they racial flavor upon sundry allusion to the amen corner judgement day gabriel s horn and a frustrate devil with a few random hallelujah throw in
