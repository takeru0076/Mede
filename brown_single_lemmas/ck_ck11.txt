there be of course no real need to rearrange everything a quarter inch this way or that for the hardbake or the toffee or the barley sugar or the sardine or the bitter or the condense milk or the stationery or the needle what could it mean adam watch he own hand make the caress anxious movement that when rain fall and nobody come and ruin draw close like a cat rub against the ankle have be the ritual of stall vendor forever he recognize the gesture he know it mean he have see a dry old yellow hand reach out with that painful solicitude to touch to rearrange to shift aimlessly some object worth a pfennig back in bavaria he have see that gesture and at that sight he heart have always die within he on such occasion he have not have the courage to look at the face above the hand whatever face it might be now the face be he own he wonder what expression a he make that gesture be on he face he wonder if it wear the old anxiety or the old taut stoicism but there be no need he remember for he hand to reach out for he face to show concern or stoicism it be nothing to he if rain fall and nobody come then why be he assume the role the gesture and the suffer what be he expiate or be he now take the role the gesture and the suffer because it be the only way to affirm he history and identity in the torpid befogged loneliness of this land this be virginia he look out of the tent at the company street the rain drip on the freeze loblolly of the street beyond that misty gray of the rain he see the stretch hutment low diminutive log cabin chink with mud with doorway a man would have to crouch to get through with roof of tent lay over bough or board from hardtack box or fence rail with cranky chimney of stick and dry mud the chimney of the hut across from he be surmount by a beef barrel with end knock out in this heavy air however that device do not seem to help the smoke from that chimney rise a sluggishly a smoke from any other and hang a sadly in the drizzle creep back down along the sop canvas of the roof over the door be a board with large inept lettering home sweet home this be the hut of simms purdew the hero the man be huddle in those lair adam know the name of some

whom he hate he have see the heavy slack bestubbled jaw open and close to emit the cruel obscene banter and have see the pale-blue eye go watery with whisky and merriment and suddenly he be not see the face of that vile creature he be see somehow the face of a young boy the boy simms purdew must once have be a boy with sorrel hair and blue eye dance with gaiety and the boy mouth grin trustfully among the freckle in that moment of vision adam hear the voice within himself say i must not hate he i must not hate he or i shall die he heart suddenly open to joy he think that if once only once he could talk with simms purdew something about he own life and all life would be clear and simple if simms purdew would turn to he and say adam you know when i be a boy it be a funny thing happen lemme tell you now if only simms purdew could do that whatever the thing he remember and tell it would be a sign for the untellable and he adam would understand now adam in the gray light of afternoon stare across at the hut opposite he tent and think of simms purdew lie in there in the gloom snore on he bunk with the fume of whisky choke the air he see the sign above the door of the hut home sweet home

the head be wrap in a turban and on top of the turban ride a great hamper across which a piece of poncho have be fling the gray face stare straight ahead in the drizzle moisture run down the cheek gather at the tip of the nose and at the chin the figure be close enough now for he to see the nose twitch to dislodge the drop cling there the figure stop and one hand be perilously free from the hamper to scratch the nose then the figure move on this be one of the irish woman who have build they own hut down near the river they do wash adam recognize this one he recognize she because she be the one who in a winter twilight on the edge of camp have once stop he and reach down she hand to touch he fly slice o mutton bhoy she have query in she soft guttural slice o mutton she name be mollie
