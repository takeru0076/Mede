it be not until we have return to the city to live while i be still at word and sharpe s that i feel the full impact of evangelical christianity i come under the spell of a young group in the church lead by the pastor s old son the spirit of this group be that we be and be live in a world doom to eternal punishment but that god through jesus christ have provide a way of escape for those who confess they sin and accept salvation there be millions who accept this doctrine but few indeed be those who accept it so truly that the fate of humanity lie a a weight on they soul night and day this group in park place church be make up of the earnest few i be draw deep and deep into these concern and responsibility i engage more and more in religious activity besides church and sunday school i go to out-of-door meeting on the sidewalk at the church door i go to an afternoon service at the afj i go to the christian endeavor society and to the even service of the church much of this lack the active support of the pastor the young people be self-energizing and i be energize once or twice i father ask i if i be nt overdo a bit in i churchgoing meanwhile i myself be not yet save at least i have be unable to lie hold on the experience of conversion try a i might to confess i sin and accept salvation no answer come to i from heaven finally after year i give up the basic difficulty i suppose be in i ultimate inability to feel a burden of sin from which i seek relief i be familiar with pilgrim s progress which i read a literature no load of sin have be lay on i shoulder nor do earnest effort enable i to become conscious of one there be of course the doctrine of original sin which assert that each of we a individual partake of the guilt of we first ancestor in the rhym catechism this doctrine be word thus in adam s fall we sin-ned all this doctrine be repugnant to i moral sense i do not feel it presumptuous to expect that the creator would be at least a just a the most righteous of he creature and the doctrine of original sin be compound of injustice some of these thought not all of they have take organize form in late year the actual impel force which sever i from evangelical effort be of another sort i become disgust at be so preoccupy with the state of i own miserable soul i find myself become one of that group of people who in carlyle s word be forever gaze into they own navel anxiously ask be i right be i wrong i bethought i of the lord s prayer and these word come to mind thou kingdom come thou will be do on earth a it be in heaven they have remain on the open page of i mind in all the year which since have pass from that time to this i religious concern be that i might give effective help to the bring in of god s kingdom on earth i do not claim to be free from sin or from the need for repentance and forgiveness in i experience the assurance of forgiveness come only when i have confess to the wronged one and have make a full reparation a i can devise there be one far step in i religious progress this be take after i come to live in springfield and it be make under the guidance of the reverend raymond beardslee a young preacher who come to the congregational church there at about the same time that i move from new york he father be a professor at hartford theological seminary and from he he acquire a conviction which he pass along to i that there be in the universe of person a moral law the law of love which be a natural law in the same sense a be the physical law it be most important that we recognize the law of love a be unbreakable in all personal relationship whether individually socially or a between whole nation of people if obey the law bring order and satisfaction if disobey the result be turmoil and chaos a we observe moral law and physical law they appear a be inevitable we can conceive of no alternative they basis seem deep than mere authority they be not true because scientist or prophet say they be true it be not the authority of god himself which make they true because god be what he be the law of the universe material and spiritual be what they be deity and law be one and inseparable with this conviction the partition between the sacred and the secular disappear one s daily work become sacred since it be perform in the field of influence of the moral law deal a it do with people a well a with matter and energy in he book civilization and ethics albert schweitzer face the moral problem which arise when moral law be recognize in business life for example he ethics define possession a the property of the community of which the individual be sovereign steward one serve society by conduct a business from which a certain number of employee draw they mean of subsistence another by give away he property in order to help he fellow man each will decide on he own course somewhere between these two extreme case accord to the sense of responsibility which be determine for he by the particular circumstance of he own life no one be to judge other he be uncompromising in assign guilt to the man who find it necessary to inflict or permit injury to one individual or group for the sake of a large good for this decision a man must take personal responsibility say he i may never imagine that in the struggle between personal and supra-personal responsibility it be possible to make a compromise between the ethical and the purposive in the shape of a relative ethic or to let the ethical be supersede by the purposive on the contrary it be i duty to make i own decision a between the two schweitzer seem in fact to acquire for himself a burden of sin not bequeath by adam but accumulate in the inevitable judgment which life require of he a between great and lesser responsibility this viewpoint i find interest but it have never weigh on i soul perhaps it should have i own experience have follow simple line an uncompromising belief in the moral law have the advantage of make religion natural even a physical law be natural neither the engineer nor the ordinary citizen feel any self-consciousness in obey the law of matter and energy nor can he achieve a sense of self-righteousness in such obedience to obey the moral law be just ordinary common sense apply to a neglect field religion thus become integrate with life this truth that the moral law be natural have other important corollary one of they be that it give mean and purpose to life in seek for such mean and purpose albert schweitzer seize upon the concept of the sacredness of life it be puzzle to the occidental mind to i at least to assign sacredness to animal insect and plant life these life be in themselves outside of the moral order and be unburden with moral responsibility there be indeed a moral responsibility on man himself for he own soul s sake to respect low life and to avoid the infliction of suffer but this viewpoint schweitzer reject so far a sacredness inhere in any aspect of creation it seem to i to be find in human personality whether in lambarene africa or in washington dc one can not read the record of scientist official and traveler who have penetrate to the mind of the most savage race without realize that each individual meet with be a person read for instance in malcolm macdonald s borneo people of segura and she wise father tomonggong koh and she final adjustment to encroach civilization above all read in jen bjerre s the last cannibal show the old man of the wailbri tribe not cannibal in central australia give to the white man he choicest possession while the tear stream down he face the australian aborigine be the conventional exemplar of degrade humanity yet here be a depth of sensibility which be lack in a considerable portion of the beneficiary of we civilization person whether white black word or yellow be a concern of god respect for personality be a privilege and a duty for we a brother such be the field for exercise we reverence a to we action let we align ourselves with the purpose express by jesus in the lord s prayer thou kingdom come thou will be do on earth a it be in heaven with the knowledge that the kingdom come by obedience to the moral law in we relation with all people we have a firm intellectual grasp on both the mean and the end of we life this intellectual approach to spiritual life suit i well because i be never content to lead a divide life a i have say word from tennyson remain ever in i memory that mind and soul accord well may make one music a before let we now give some think to the soul when the young biologist dr ballard begin to show interest in we daughter elizabeth this induce a correspond interest on we part in he i ask one day what he be do he tell i that he have a big newt and a little newt and that he be transplant a big eye of the big newt onto the little newt and a little eye of the little newt onto the big newt he be then note that the big eye on the little newt hang back until the little eye have grow up to it while the little eye on the big newt grow rapidly until it be a big a the other then i ask what do that teach you say he it teach i to wonder this be a profound statement in the face of the unfold universe we ultimate attitude be that of wonder wonder be indeed the intellectual gateway to the spiritual world go be the day when in the nineteenth century scientist think that they be close to the attainment of complete knowledge of the physical universe for they only a little more need to be learn and then all physical knowledge could be neatly sort package and put in the inventory to be draw on for the solution of any human problem this complacency be blow to bit by the relativity of einstein the revelation of the complex anatomy of the atom and the discovery of the expand universe none of these discovery be neatly round off bit of knowledge each fade out into the unexplored area of the future it be a if we in we center of human observation from time to time penetrate more deeply into the unknown a we radius of penetration r increase the area of new knowledge increase by afj and the total of human knowledge become measure in term of afj wonder grow it be endless there be some people intelligent people who seem to be untouched by the sea of wonder in which we be immerse and in which we spend we life one such be abraham meyer the writer of a recent book speak of man this be a straightforward denial of the spiritual world and a vigorous defense of pure materialism he inability to wonder vitiate he argument the subject of immortality bring to mind a vivid incident which take place in 1929 at montreux in switzerland
