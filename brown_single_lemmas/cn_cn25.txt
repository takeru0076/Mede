rubbery a he foot slow he feel ashamed of the panic and resolve to make a stand he cross the next meadow and climb a tree where the jungle trail resume in the leafiest part of the tree straddle a broad horizontal limb he could see over the meadow for a while he be content to let event develop in they good time he have no doubt the marine be the lead scout of a column and while he shoot have probably breed indecision they would soon come hunt he superior have emphasize that marine torture other for the sheer pleasure yesterday today tomorrow no surrender he remember the self-dictate bring no peace only a faint chill of doubt he murmur to himself with firmness no surrender it be good to die fight the marine he superior have also preach this say it be the way for eternal honor what if the marine never come he comrade be all dead he have no rice then it would be a choice between starvation and suicide whichever the way he would rot in this vast choke green he wife never to receive an urn of he ash he sigh and lean for a moment against the trunk he finger touch the bone handle of a knife the knife an ammunition pouch and a half-filled bottle of purify water hang on he belt besides the belt he wear a loin cloth a he look up from pick at a leg ulcer he see a marine in the jungle across the clear gloom recede the marine come to the edge of the green jungle mist and stay a though debate whether to brave the sunlight he fatigue make a streak of almost phosphorescent green in the mist come out come out in the meadow matsuo say under he breath the man lean against a tree and wipe a sleeve across he face a signal matsuo lift he rifle ease the sling under he leave upper arm for steadiness fresh on he mind be event of the past day when he whole regiment be destroy in the hill they have fight from cave and the marine resort to burn they out even now like a ring in he ear he hear the wooooosh of flame-thrower squirt great orange billow a wave of flame ripple through they cave have reach nagamo he friend and with a shriek the man bolt through the entrance then slow to the jerky walk of a puppet he uniform blaze the marine let he advance when he sink on he knee they have allow he to char without administer the stroke of mercy matsuo have fake death and be pitch on a stack of corpse both the burn and the unburned the latter decompose rapidly under the tropical sun the callous marine have laugh at each other s retch while stack body matsuo repeatedly choke down he own nausea at nightfall he have be able to sneak down a hillside and into the jungle reek of death apprehensively he peer to the leave to the right into the leafy vine-crisscrossed maze he decide that the marine must be deploy around the meadow with the one leave to distract he he strain he hear cautious foot step on leafmold faint creak of belt and sling whisper he hear none of these only the hum of insect and the distant flutter call of a bird because he could nt hear they he be more convince they be there a spectacle occur across the meadow the lone marine take a seat on the ground lean sidewise on a tree trunk he embrace it humiliation make matsuo tremble while he comrade cock the trap that one behave a if it be some dull maneuver take aim at the man s face matsuo squeeze the trigger up to the point of discharge and then he change he mind he want the arrogant marine to know fear and so he aim above the head the shoot reverberate in diminish whiplash of sound hush follow like a mischievous boy expect punishment matsuo await reaction from the jungle how stupid to give he position away the jungle do not retort the sitter remain seat hug the tree before long the atmosphere revert to it old normalcy and insect hum and bird occasionally call matsuo puzzle and grow anxious over the complete passiveness conclude that he be the butt of a devilish joke five or so minute late the marine abruptly pull up and step into sunlight immediately throw he hand over he eye he go into a whirl dance a sort of blind chase of the tail it end when he tumble but jump right up he stagger in no particular direction he wear no head cover of any kind and more odd have no visible weapon with a sudden decisiveness he lurch in matsuo s direction cross the meadow in a zigzag gallop when he get close to the tree matsuo note the wild look on he face the pocket of he jacket bulge hand grenade the bob head be a poor target so matsuo shoot he in the upper trunk the marine spin clap a hand high on he chest and dive forward in the hush that follow the echo matsuo be tense they could come on he now without difficulty gradually he reach a conclusion the marine be alone for they be impatient people and by now would have vie to knock he from the tree down the tree he scramble and kneel at the edge of foliage the marine be sprawl some thirty yard away one arm extend matsuo jump when the hide arm flop out reflex rifle leveled on the man he make a rush heat in the
