the most beautiful bed of pansy i ve see be in a south dakota yard on a sizzle day pansy be suppose to like it cool but those great velvety flower be healthy and perky in { the glare sun i seek out the gardener and ask he what he do to produce such beauty in that weather he seem puzzle by i question i just love they he say the more i talk with he the more convince i become that that be the secret of they riotous bloom of course he love be express in intelligent care he plant the pansy seed himself buy they from a pansy specialist these specialist i learn have do a great deal of work to improve the size and health of the plant and the result flower they seed produce vigorous bloom plant half again the size of the unimproved strain i ask he if he take seed from he own plant occasionally when he have an unusual flower that he want more of he do but pansy seed he tell i soon run down it s good to buy they fresh from a dealer who be work to improve they he soil be nothing special just prairie land but he have harrow in compost until it be loose spongy and word-black i finger it and have the feel of adequacy that come with the right texture tilth and body it be nt easy to describe it but every gardener know it when he finger touch such soil nothing be easy to grow from seed than pansy they germinate quickly the tiny plant appear in a week and grow along lustily it do nt really matter which month of the year you sow they but they germinate good when they have a wide variation of temperature very warm follow by cool in the same 24 hour i like to make a seedbed right in the open though many people start they successfully in cold frame pansy do nt have to be coddle they d rather have thing rugged with only moderate protection on the cold day if you do use a cold frame be sure that it ventilation be adequate for i seedbed i use good garden soil with a little sand add to encourage root i dig it rake it smooth sow the seed and wet they down with a fog spray then i cover the sow with a board this keep it cool and moist and protect it from bird ant carry away the seed so good be sure that there be no ant hill nearby when the first sprinkle of green appear i remove the board a light porous mulch apply now keep the root cool and the soil soft during these early day of growth i like sawdust for this or hay when they have 4 to 6 leave and be thrifty little plant it s time to set they out where they be to remain every time you transplant a pansy you cause it flower to become small the moral be do nt transplant it any oftener than you must a soon a they be large enough to move i put } i 9 inch apart where they be to bloom i put a little scoop of pulverize phosphate rock or steam bone meal into each hole with the plant that encourage root and the good develop the root the large and more plentiful the flower pansy be glutton i doubt if it be possible to overfeed they i spade lot of compost into they bed lack that decay manure spread over the bed be fine one year i simply set the plant in the remain of a compost pile to which a little sand have be add and i have the most beautiful pansy in i or any of i neighbor experience in addition to the rich soil they benefit by feeding of manure water every other week dilute to the color of weak tea a a substitute for this organic fertilizer dissolve in water to half the strength in the direction may be use they need mulch we put a light mulch over the seedling now we must use a heavy one three inch of porous material will do a good job of keep weed down and the soil moist and cool when winter come be ready with additional mulch i like hay for this and apply it so that only the top of the plant show right after a good frost that keep in the cold retain moisture and prevent the heave of alternate freeze and thaw do nt miss the pansy that appear from time to time through the winter whenever there be a thaw or a few sunny day you ll be likely to find a brave little blossom or two if those be nt enough for you why not grow some just for winter bloom the pansy i cherish most bloom for i in february during a particularly cold winter i start the seed in a flat in june and set out the little pansy in a cold frame an unheated greenhouse would have be good if i have have one the plant take zero night in they stride with nothing but a mat of straw over the glass to protect they in response to the lengthen day of february they bud then bloom they 4-inch velvety flower that cold frame be i morale builder it mass of bright bloom set in a border of snow make i spirit rise every time i look at it like strawberry in december pansy be far more exciting in february than in may try that late winter pickup when you be so tire of cold and snow that you feel you just can nt take another day of it the day will come in midsummer when you find you plant become leggy run to tall-growing foliage at the expense of blossom try peg down each separate branch to the earth use a bobby pin to hold it there pick the flower keep the soil dampen and each of the pegged-down branch will take root and become a little plant and go on bloom for the rest of the season a soon a an experimental tug assure you that root have take over cut it off from the mother plant a second and also good practice be to shear off the top leave an inch high stub with just a leaf or two on each branch these cut-down plant will bud and blossom in record time and will behave just a they do in early spring i like to shear half i plant at a time leave one half of they to blossom while the second half be get start on it new round of bloom probably no one need to tell you that the way to stop all bloom be to let the blossom go to seed nature s aim different from ours be to provide for the come generation that do she work be accomplish and she ignore the plant here be a word of advice when you go shop for you pansy seed go to a reputable grower preferably a pansy specialist it be no hard to raise big healthy bloom plant than weak sickly little thing in fact it be easy but you will never get good flower than the seed you grow many people think that pansy last only a few week then they period of growth and bloom be over that be not true if the plant be care for and protect over the winter the second year be more prolific than the first would you like to grow exhibition pansy remove about half the branch from each plant leave only the strong with the large bud the flower will be huge pansy have character they stick to they principle insist upon they due but grow and bloom with dependable regularity if give it treat they right and they ll make a show every month in the year except the frigid one give they food some shade mulch water and more food and they ll repay you solicitude with beauty a salad
