they should be know and remember in this sequence i shall write about they in the order of they erection the first bridge know to have be cover wholly or in part and perhaps the most interest one connect newbury now newburyport with salisbury point it build be first propose in 1791 when a group of citizen mostly newburyport man petition the general court for an act of incorporation this document begin no 1 newbury port may 30th 1791 whereas a bridge over merrimack river from the land of honble jonathan greenleaf esquire in newbery to deer island and from say island to salisbury would be of very extensive utility by afford a safe conveyance to carriage team and traveller at all season of the year and at all time of tide we the subscriber do agree that a soon a a convenient number of person have subscribe to this or a similar write we will present a petition to the honble general court of the commonwealth of massachusetts pray for an act incorporate into a body politic the

november 26 of that year the bridge be complete and open timothy palmer who invent and late patent the arch type of construction for wooden bridge be the genius who plan and supervise the build of the essex or deer island bridge although the actual work be carry out under the direction of william coomb who receive $ 300 a recompense this two-part bridge be good describe by rev timothy dwight president of yale college in he travel in new-england and new-york publish in new haven in 1821 he say of it it consist of two division separate by an island at a small distance from the southern

mark in appearance and construction it resemble the pascataqua bridge the whole length of essex bridge be one thousand and thirty foot and it breadth thirty-four i have already mention that mr timothy palmer of newburyport be the inventor of the arch bridge in this country a mr palmer be educate to house-building only and have never see a structure of this nature he certainly deserve not a little credit for the invention it be hardly necessary to remind student of cover bridge that timothy palmer be bear in 1751 in nearby rowley that he move with he parent to west boxford when he be sixteen year old and be there apprentice to a builder and architect moody spofford it be indeed a remarkable feat that a man who have have no experience of bridge build should have apply the principle of the arch which appear in he famous bridge at portsmouth haverhill and philadelphia the essex merrimack bridge when first build be not cover a far a we know no american bridge have be thus protect in 1792 richard s allen be the authority for the statement that the northern section be probably roof by 1810 it original appearance be show in an engrave publish in the massachusetts magazine in may 1793 which be reproduce herewith fig 1 a brief description accompany the picture say that the bridge contain more than 6000 ton of timber between the abutment on the newbury shore and the south bank of deer island there be one span or arch measure 160 foot between the north shore of deer island and the salisbury side there be an arch of 113 foot and a series of pier with a draw forty foot long a dinner and celebration in honor of this piece of engineering take place july 4 1793 in a tavern erect by the corporation on the island it be say that the eccentric timothy dexter who be one of the first share-holders stand on the table and make a speech worthy of the occasion the essex journal say that he deliver an oration on the bridge which for elegance of style propriety of speech or force of argument be truly ciceronian the reporter must have write this with tongue in cheek because dexter s oration could hardly be understand and although he late explain that he be talk french it seem rather more likely that he have succumb to the joy of the even the north portion of the essex bridge be well worth the cost of construction although it prove to be twice what be estimate in the begin it stand in it original form until 1882 the southern half however on account of it underbracing be consider by boat owner a menace to navigation in 1810 it be tear down and replace by a chain suspension bridge this be build by john templeman from plan submit by jame finley of fayette county pennsylvania timothy palmer have general supervision of the work an advertisement in the newburyport herald december 21 1810 show palmer in a new light a an expert on chain bridge it read chain bridge information be hereby give that mr timothy palmer of newburyport mass have agree to take charge of the concern of the patentee of the chain bridge in the state of massachusetts new hampshire vermont rhode island and connecticut so far a relate to the sale of patent right and the construction of chain bridge mr palmer will attend to any application relate to bridge and if desire will view the propose site and lie out and superintend the work or recommend a suitable person to execute it john templeman approve timothy palmer this chain bridge prove less durable than the wooden arch on the salisbury end it fall february 6 1827 carry with it a horse and wagon two man and four ox the horse and man be save but the ox drown in spite of this catastrophe the bridge be rebuild on the same plan and open again on july 17 1827 this second chain bridge be 570 foot long have two thirty-foot tower and a draw and a double roadway the essex bridge be a toll cross until 1868 when the county commissioner lay out all the merrimack bridge a highway sturdy and strong after more than a century of continuous use the old cover wooden bridge that span the tygartis valley river at philippi will have a distinctive part in the week-long observance of the first land battle of the civil war at it home site may 28th to june 3rd colonel frederick w lander impersonate will again make he break-neck ride down the steep declivity of talbott s now college hill and thunder across the bridge to join colonel benjamin f kelley s west virginia infantry then swarm through the street in pursuit of the retreat confederate he be closely follow by the ohio and indiana troop thus the old bridge have another distinction that of be the first such structure secure by force of arm in the war of the 60s the bridge have survive the natural hazard of the element war fire and flood a well a injury incident to heavy traffic for more than a hundred year twice during the civil war it be save from destruction by the oppose army by the plea and prayer of a local minister it still stand a a monument to the engineering skill of the last century and still serve in the gasoline age to carry heavy traffic on we route 250 the old beverly and fairmont turnpike it be one of the very few if not the only survive bridge of it type to serve a main artery of the we highway system thus it be far more than a relic of the horse and buggy day this cover wooden bridge be so closely identify with the first action in the early morning of june 3 1861 and with subsequent troop movement of both army in the philippi area that it have become a part and parcel of the war story so frequently have picture of the bridge appear in book and in national publication that it vie with the old john word fort at harper ferry a the two nationally good know structure in west virginia complete and open for traffic in 1852 the

builder they have construct nine of the cover wooden bridge on the parkersburg and staunton turnpike a dozen year before a well a many other bridge for several county the philippi bridge however be the chenoweth master piece with it 139-foot dual lane span and it stand today a a monument to it builder never rebuild the bridge be strengtened in 1938 by two extra pier a concrete floor and a walk-way along the upper side in order to care for modern traffic during the war it be in constant use by the wagon train transport supply from the railhead at grafton to the troop operate in the interior union soldier at time use it for sleep quarter to escape from the rain or other inclement weather and some of they leave momentoes of they stay by carve they name and small token on it wall and beam but what the element could not do be seriously threaten when brigadier general william e grumble jones reach philippi while on the famous jones-imboden raid in may 1863 general jones be fresh from a long series of bridge burning include the long bridge at fairmont and after see a great drive of horse and cattle he have collect safely across the bridge he send he man to work pile combustible in and around it reverend joshual corder a baptist minister gather a few citizen of southern sympathy to call on jones and plead with he to spare the structure he reason and argue point
