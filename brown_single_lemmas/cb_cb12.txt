simultaneously with the publish today of the new testament the first part of the new english bible undertake a a new translation of the scripture into contemporary english since it be issue in the spring of 1611 the king jame version have be most generally consider the most poetic and beautiful of all translation of the bible however biblical scholar frequently attest to it numerous inaccuracy a old manuscript be uncover and scholarship advance this result in revision of the king jame bible in 1881-85 a the english revise version and in 1901 a the american standard version then in 1937 america s international council of religious education authorize a new revision in the light of expand knowledge of ancient manuscript and language undertake by 32 american scholar under the chairmanship of rev dr luther a weigle former dean of yale university divinity school they study result in the publish of the revise standard version 1946-52 not rival the new english bible the old testament and apocrypha will be publish at a future date have not be plan to rival or replace the king jame version but a it cover state it be offer simply a the bible to all those who will use it in read teach or worship time of course will testify whether the new version will have achieve it purpose bible read even more so than good classical music grow in depth and mean upon repetition if this new bible do not increase in significance by repeat reading throughout the year it will not survive the age a have the king jame version however an initial perusal and comparison of some of the famous passage with the same part of other version seem to speak well of the effort of the british biblical scholar one be impress with the dignity clarity and beauty of this new translation into contemporary english and there be no doubt that the mean of the bible be more easily understandable to the general reader in contemporary language in the frequently archaic word and phrase of the king jame for example in the third chapter of matthew verse 13-16 describe the baptism of jesus the 1611 version read then come jesus from galilee to jordan unto john to be baptize of he but john forbad he say i have need to be baptize of thou and comest thou to i and jesus answer say unto he suffer it to be so now for thus it becometh we to fulfill all righteousness then he suffer he and jesus when he be baptize go up straightway out of the water and lo the heaven be open unto he and he see the spirit of god descend like a dive and light upon he clear mean certainly the mean be clear to one who be not familiar with biblical teaching in the new english bible which read then jesus arrive at jordan from galilee and he come to john to be baptize by he john try to dissuade he do you come to i he say i need rather to be baptize by you jesus reply let it be so for the present we do well to conform this way with all that god require john then allow he to come after baptism jesus come up out of the water at once and at that moment heaven open he see the spirit of god descend like a dive to alight upon he the paragraph spell and punctuation be reproduce a print in each version among the most frequently quote biblical sentence be the beatitude and yet so few person other than scholar really understand the true mean of these eight blessing utter by jesus at the begin of the sermon on the mount to illustrate the first bless in the king jame bible read bless be the poor in spirit for they s be the kingdom of heaven the new version state how blest be those who know that they be poor the kingdom of heaven be theirs some of the poetic cadence of the old version certainly be lose in the new one but almost anyone with a fair knowledge of the english language can understand the mean without the necessity of interpretation by a biblical scholar to a novice that be significant in the second and third chapter of revelation the new version retain however the old phrase angel of the church which biblical scholar have previously interpret a mean bishop this be not contemporary english mostly contemporary for the most part however the new version be contemporary and a such should be the mean for many to attain a clear comprehension of the mean of those word record so many hundreds of year ago by the first follower of christ originally record by hand these word have be copy and recopy translate and retranslated through the age discovery recently make of old biblical manuscript in hebrew and greek and other ancient writing some by the early church father in themselves call for a restudy of the bible to have the result record in everyday usable english should be of benefit to all who seek the truth there be one danger however with contemporary english change with the rapidity that mark this jet age some of the word and phrase of the new version may themselves soon become archaic the only answer will be continuous study the new testament offer to the public today
