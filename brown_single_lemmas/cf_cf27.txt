except for the wine waiter in a restaurant always an inscrutable plenipotentiary unto himself the genii with the key to unlock the gate of the wine world be one s dealer and the foreign shipper or negociant who in turn supply he in instance where both of these be person or firm with integrity the situation be ideal it may on occasion be anything but that however by cultivate a wine dealer and accept he advice one will soon enough ascertain whether he have any knowledge of wine a oppose to what he may have be tell by salesman and promoter and good yet whether he have a taste for wine again by spread one s purchase over several wine dealer one become familiar with the name and specialty of reputable wine dealer and shipper abroad this be important because despite all the effort of the french government an appreciable segment of france s export trade in wine be still taint with a misrepresentation approach downright dishonesty and there be many too many negociants who would rather turn a sou than amass a creditable reputation overseas a good negociant or shipper will not only be the man or the firm which have corner the wine from the good vineyard or the good part of they he may also be the one who make and bottle the good blend sound wine from vineyard generally in he own district these be the wine the french themselves use for everyday drink for even in france virtually no one drink the grand crus on a meal-to-meal basis the grand crus be expensive and even dote palate tire of they and certainly in the case of the beginner or the comparatively uninitiated wine drinker the palate and the capacity for appreciation will not be ready for the grand crus a a steady diet without frequent recourse to crus of less renown there be nothing infra dig about a good blend from a good shipper some of they be very delicious indeed and there be many good one export unfortunately along with other not so good and bad consultation with a reputable wine dealer and constant experimentation steer ever from the know to the unknown be the requisite wine waiter be something else again especially if one be travel or dine out a great deal they importance mount most of they the world over operate on the same principle by which justice be administer in france and some other latin country the customer be to be consider guilty of abysmal ignorance until prove otherwise with the burden of proof on the customer himself now the drink of wine and happily so be for the most part a recondite affair for manifestly if everyone in the world who could afford the good wine also like they the supply would dry up in no time at all this be the only valid and extenuate argument that may be advance in defense of the reprehensible attitude of the common wine waiter a really good wine waiter be paradoxically the guardian and not the purveyor of he cellar against the visigoths face on the one hand with an always exhaustible supply of he good wine and on the other by a clientele usually equip with inexhaustible pocketbooks it be a wonder indeed that all wine waiter be not afflict with chronic ambivalence the one way to get around they short of know exactly what one want and stick to it be to frequent a single establishment until it wine waiter be persuade that one be at least a interest in wine a in spend money only then perhaps will he reveal he jewel and he bargain wine buy from a dealer should ideally be allow to rest for several week before it be serve this be especially true of red wine and a practice which though not always practicable be well worth the effort it do no harm for wine to stand on end for a matter of day but in term of month and year it be fatal wine store for a long time should be on it side otherwise the cork dry and air enter to spoil it when stack wine on it side in a bin care should always be take to be sure there be no air bubble leave next to the cork fat bottle such a burgundy have a way of roll around in the bin and often need little prop such a a bit of cardboard or a chip of wood to hold they in the proper recline posture too much dampness in the cellar rot the cork again with ill effect the good rule of thumb for detect cork wine provide the eye have not already spot it be to smell the wet end of the cork after pull it if it smell of wine the bottle be probably all right if it smell of cork one have ground for suspicion seasonal rise or drop in temperature be bad for wine they age it prematurely the ideal storage temperature for long period be about fifty-five degree with an allowable range of five degree above or below this provide there be no sudden or frequent change prolong vibration be also undesirable consequently one s wine closet or cellar should be away from machine or electrically drive furnace if one life near a subway or an express parkway the solution be to have one s wine store with a dealer and bring home a few at a time light especially daylight be always bad for wine all in all though there be a good deal of nonsense expend over the preparation think necessary for ordinary wine drink many people go to extreme length in decant chill or warm or banish without far investigation any bottle with so much a a slightly suspicious cork no one should wish to deny these purist the obvious pleasure they derive from all this and to give fair warn where warn be due no one who become fond of wine ever avoid acquire some degree of purism but the fact remain that in most restaurant include some of the good of paris and bordeaux and dijon the bottle be frankly and simply bring from the cellar to the table when order and all the condition or preparation it ever receive take place while the chef be prepare the meal a white wine already at cool cellar temperature may be adequately chill in a bucket of ice and water or the freeze compartment of a refrigerator the former be far preferable in about fifteen minute for those who live in a winter climate there be nothing good than a bucket of water and snow though by no mean an ideal procedure a red wine may similarly be bring from the cellar to the dine room and open twenty minute or so before serve time it may be a bit cold when pour but again a one will have observe at any restaurant worth it salt wine should be serve in a large tulip-shaped glass which be never fill more than half full in this way red wine warm of itself quite rapidly and though it be true that it may not attain it potential of taste and fragrance until after the middle of the meal or the course in the meantime it will have run the gamut of many beguiling and interest stage the only cardinal sin which may be commit in warm a wine be to force it by put it next to the stove or in front of an open fire this invariably efface any wine s character and drive it fragrance underground it should not be forget that wine mature fast in half-bottle less fast in full bottle slowly in magnum and slow yet in tregnums double magnum jeroboams methuselah and imperiales respectively very old red wine often require several hour of aeration and any red wine bring from the cellar within half an hour of mealtime should be uncork and allow some air but white wine never white wine should be open when serve have be previously chill in proportion to they sweetness thus sauterne or barsacs should be very cold a pouilly-fuisse or a chablis somewhat less cold over-chilling be an accept method for cover up the fault of many a cheap or poor white wine especially a dry wine and certainly less of a crime than serve a wine at a temperature which reveal it a unattractive the fragrance and taste of any white wine will die a linger death when it be allow to warm or be expose for long to the air to quote professor saintsbury the last glass of claret or burgundy be a good a the first but the first glass of chateau dyquem or montrachet be a great deal good than the last this do not mean though that a red wine improve with prolong aeration there be a reasonable limit and wine keep over to the next meal or the next day after they have once be open be never a good if this must be do they should always be cork and keep in a cool place it should be remember that they last quality be appreciably short than those of milk a few red wine notably those of the beaujolais be good consume at cellar temperature by tradition a red wine should be serve at approximately room temperature if anything a little cool and be age enough for the tannin and acid to have work out and the sediment have settle well thus red wine must if possible never be disturb or shake very old red wine be often decant so that the pucker bitter element which have settle to the bottom will not be mingle with the wine itself a tug-of-war between an old bottle and an inefficient corkscrew may do a much harm a a week at sea the cork should be pull gradually and smoothly and the lip of the bottle wipe afterward many people use wicker cradle for old red wine lift the bottle carefully from the bin into the cradle and eventually to the table without disturb the sediment another school frown on such a shortcut and insist that after leave the bin an old red wine should first stand on end for several day to allow the sediment to roll to the very bottom after which the bottle may be gently ease to a tilt position on it side in the cradle in france when one wish to entertain at a restaurant and serve truly fine old red wine one visit the restaurant well ahead of time choose the wine and with the advice of the manager and he chef build the menu around they the wine waiter will see to it that the bottle be take from the bin and open at least in time to warm and aerate preferably allow to stand on end for a long a possible and perhaps in the case of very old wine be decant decant old wine aerate it fully it may also be practically speak a matter of good economy for in the process of decant the bottle be only tilt once instead of several or more time at the table hence a minimum of the undesirable mixture of wine and dregs though there be many exception which we have note in precede page white wine be a a rule good consume between two and six year old and red wine nowadays between three and ten red wine of good year tend to mature late and to keep long the average claret be notably longer-lived than it opposite number red burgundy some claret do not come into they own until they be ten or fifteen year of age or even more if a red bordeaux of a good name and year be bitter or acid or cloy and muddy-tasting leave it alone for a while most of the wine of beaujolais on the other hand should be drink while very young and alsatian may be
