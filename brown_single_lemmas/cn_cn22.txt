 i guess he spend the morning get himself all organize then head for home maybe to beat up on he squaw benson look up and see ramey s long head tilt forward to rub he chin on the stiff edge of the overall bib ramey reach out with the tire iron and dislodge a chunk of mud that be cake on the spare tire rack i d like to know just which it be that those guy do nt understand the liquor or automobile somehow the think of a simple man bewilder by thing no one have ever really help he understand move the driver for a moment he hatred toward drunken or careless driver soften maybe the indian be nt too much at fault ramey think maybe he be only do the good he know how like any of we anyway he do nt deserve to lie there in the sun and be stare at ever see yourself spread out on the pavement benny he say to he partner you mean dream not exactly just see it benson grin and flip a rock with he thumb like a marble nope just you all the time sometimes i think it s the only way i ll ever get a decent partner ramey smile but he think to himself i always see i too never benny whenever he see someone lie in the dirt ramey wonder what the person have be think and he would try out thought in he own mind then he would realize they be really thing that only he himself could think with this realization sometimes he see himself a he look down you see he yet benson say refer to the indian he be nt in the car ramey say you do nt go clear around benson say if you want to see something he s back on the other side by the trunk of the car too long a wait line ramey answer pretend to joke a few minute late the insurance man a road checker drive up in the gray coupe with license plate on it from a far-away state it be a trick they use to try and conceal they identity when they follow truck to check they speed sometimes they just park at the side of the road and use radar on the truck a they pass all the driver know about the plate and they also know about the big floppy straw hat with shred edge the kind native in travel ad wear when they be out joyfully chop cane horsely an agent on the east end wear the hat try to look like a tourist it have always seem strange to ramey that to disguise himself a a tourist an ex-truck driver like horsely would merely pick something outlandish and put it on he head the insurance man inform they that he have talk to crumley who be all right and that he would watch the man s personal effect until they tow the rig back to town he chat with ramey and benson for a minute or so in the meager shade of the trailer every so often the diminish sound of a car come under the trailer a it slow down for the wreck then speed up again a it get clear when they be ready to leave benson and ramey walk back around the rear of the trailer there s a body you will nt mind look at benson say and they stop she have drive up with she husband in a convertible with eastern license plate although the two driver know nothing at the moment about that she wear shorts and a loose terry-cloth shirt slender and tan she dark word hair be draw straight back simply what outfit do she drive for benson say see she cause a lurch in ramey a recognition she might have be someone he have once love he have never see she before but now he think of the manner in which he and benson go in and out of the city at each end of they run the truck route the industrial area with wall grime with diesel smoke pass briefly through he mind back alley be they access to a city and they could never stay how would you ever see she again the feel subside it be only a small yearn they work be lonely what s she do in this bunch benson say and ramey wonder how close they thought might have be the girl look around at the countryside she glance swing past the trailer where the two driver be stand it make only a tiny bump over the two man like a tire over a piece of gravel then move on she begin to watch a blonde-haired man also in shorts stand right at the rear of the wreck car in the one spot that most of the crowd have detour slightly what have catch he attention be obscure by the car itself so that neither the girl nor the truck driver could see but benson know what it be the girl take a couple of step toward the man in shorts when benson in that barefoot courtliness ramey could never decide be real say you do nt want to go around there maam the girl stop but do not turn she head or acknowledge that someone have speak to she the man stand near the bend levi-clad body of the indian who lie face down almost under the car the two driver move close what do he want a spoon benson say to ramey one tiny detail in a happen can clog the memory and stick like meat in a crook tooth while the rest of the occurrence will go hazy and uncertain with ramey it be a dusty work shoe that be half-off the indian s foot that he would always remember the lace be break at the bottom of the eyelet but there be still a bow knot at the top the slight twitch would have part the shoe entirely from the foot yet the toe be still inside the two man in overall stand just behind the blonde-headed man he wear tennis shorts and a white sweater with a red v at the neck the sleeve push above the elbow he turn and look at they with clear blue eye immaculate eye he be very tan big hand might have tear he from a coca-cola poster he s dead be nt he the man say he turn and bend over the body of the indian there be nothing in particular on the man s face it be simply a matter of curiosity a natural right to examine what s this the man say back up a step still look down he word be mostly to himself do nt there be a gentle concern in benson s voice ramey look down and see the white sneaker at the bottom of the man s tan leg cautiously nudge a bit of fold blood-flecked substance lie by itself on the pavement but what be it the man say with a tone of impatience but what be it the man have speak only once ramey hear the word again inside weaken the way move water sound through a grove of tree until he be not sure whether it be sound or light-headedness press in he ear the sneaker reach out once more to tap against the mass and ramey s vision darken except for an unreasonable clarity of the man s leg ramey see sunlight touch the curly blonde hair on the word skin he stare at the shine shine circle of hair and hear the voice of he partner through tree do nt do that fella they s brain the man seem to sink a little a ramey bring the tire iron down on he shoulder and it seem that the blonde head be turn a he hit the man again with he fist ramey swing and catch the man just to the leave of he mouth it be a straight solid once-in-a-lifetime shoot he lay all four knuckle in between the man s cheekbone and he chin ramey s fist and the air expel from the man s collapse cheek make a hollow pop in the air like cup hand clap together the man take two short step backward then sit down heavily on the pavement ramey hear a cry from the girl and feel a slight pain somewhere in he hand a he watch the man sit suddenly a detach part of he mind observe how very difficult it be really to knock a man off he foot he have nt do it this time and he would never again hit anyone so hard with a thoughtful look the man sit on the pavement leg straight out in front of he he arm hang like empty shirt sleeve and he mouth be slightly open after what seem several second the open mouth grow dark inside then blood begin to ooze from it the man bring one hand up slowly and the finger fumble across he face until he touch he mouth he moan and pull the hand away even yet there be no realization in he eye ramey could hear the crowd come up rapidly behind he and the question voice come over he shoulder have no identity or importance to he he do not look around what happen someone say he s hurt a woman s voice say and then he hear a sort of wail from the man s wife the man on the ground begin to move one of he hand flatten out on the pavement and support he blood drip down the front of he sweater soak into a dark streak of dirt that run diagonally across the white wool on he shoulder a though the bright v weave into the neckline have melt run a dark color the girl kneel by she husband with one arm at he back can you hear can you talk to i she beg an incoherent puzzle sound come from the red mouth the girl look around quickly at several of the people none of the crowd have step forward to help then she see ramey and she face be misshapen with bewilderment why do you do it why do you hit he she say she voice rise ramey say nothing a shine in she eye suddenly become tear and she turn back to she husband again behind ramey foot scrape beneath sharp question whisper no one seem to know for sure what have happen nor be there any purpose or responsibility in the mutter foot and urgent voice behind the driver beyond find out ramey look around and catch sight of he partner near the front end of the wreck truck talk to the patrolman benson move he arm gesture with an unfamiliar vigor and talk rapidly ramey catch a glimpse of the insurance man some of the ruddiness be go from he face and he stare at ramey it s all over now the driver think a he see the patrolman turn and walk rapidly down along the trailer toward they ramey watch he come with a vision a clean a the glare on the metal side of the trailer he see the dark sweat spot flip in and out of sight under the patrolman s swing arm and in the leather holster that swagger and roll at the side of he stocky body the sun leave a smoky shine on the narrow strip of blue metal that run between the horn handle of he pistol all right step back the patrolman say to no one in particular a he push between the fat man in the baseball cap and a young boy in levis he walk straight up to the man sit on the ground and bend over to look at he you all right mough it s i mough the man say try to talk without move he lip he word face look gray from dirt streak where he hand have come off the dusty pavement and rub across it
