all false god resemble moloch at least in the early phase of they career so it would be unreasonable to expect any form of idol-worship to become widespread without the accompaniment of human sacrifice but there be reason in all thing and in this country the heathenish cult of the motor-car be exceed all bound in it demand the annual butchery of 40000 american man woman and child to satiate it blood-lust be excessive a quota of 25000 a year would be more than sufficient no other popular idol be accord even that much grace if the railroad for example regularly slaughter 25000 passenger each year the high priest of the cult would have cause to tremble for they personal safety for such a holocaust would excite demand for the hang of every railroad president in the unite state but by comparison with the railroad the motor car be a relatively new object of popular worship so it be too much to hope that it may be bring within the bound of civilize usage quickly and easily yet it be plainly time to make a start and to be effective the first move should be highly dramatic without be fanatical here then be what swift would have call a modest proposal by way of a begin from next new year s day let we keep careful account of each successive fatality on the highway publicize it on all media of communication to avoid suspicion of bigotry let the hand of vengeance be stay until the meat-wagon have pick up the twenty-five thousandth corpse but let the twenty-five thousand and first butchery be the signal for the arrest of the 50 state highway commissioner then let the whole lot be hang in a public mass execution on july 4 1963 the scene of course should be nine mile northwest of centralia illinois the geographical center of population accord to the census a special grandstand protect by awning from the midsummer sun of illinois should be erect for occupancy by honore guest who should include the ambassador of all those new african nation a yet not quite convince that the unite state be thoroughly civilize the band should play the rogue march a a processional switch to hail columbia happy land a the trap be spring independence day be the appropriate date a a symbolical reminder of the american article of faith that government be institute among man to secure to they certain inalienable right the first of which be life and when any government become subversive of that end it be the right of the people to alter or abolish it the highway system be an agency of government and when it grind up 40000 american every year the government be destroy it own taxpayer which be obviously a silly thing for any government to do hang the responsible official would not abolish the government but would emphasize it accountability for the life of it individual citizen which would certainly alter it and definitely for the good moreover the salubrious effect would not be exclusively political but at least partially and perhaps primarily social it would challenge sharply not the cult of the motor car itself but some of it ancillary belief and practice for instance the doctrine that the fulfillment of life consist in proceed from hither to yon not for any advantage to be gain by arrival but merely to avoid the cardinal sin of stasis or a it be generally term stay put true the adherent of stay put be now reduce to a minor even a miniscule sect and they credo home-keeping heart be happy be a disreputable a socinianism nonetheless although few in number they be a stubborn crew a tenacious of life a the hardshell baptist which suggest that there be some kind of vital principle embody in they faith perhaps there be more truth than we be wont to admit in the conviction of that ornament of tarheelia robert ruark s grandfather who be persuade that the great curse of the modern world be all this gallivantin in any event the yearly sacrifice of 40000 victim be a hecatomb too large to be justify by the most ardent faith somehow we contemporary moloch must be induce to see reason since appeal to morality to humanity and to sanity have have such small effect perhaps we last recourse be the deterrent example if we make it establish custom that whenever butchery on the highway grow excessive say beyond 25000 per annum then somebody be go to hang it follow that the more eminent the victim the more impressive the lesson to hang 50 governor might be preferable except that they be not directly relate to the highway so all thing consider the highway commissioner would seem to be elect a the new cloud of radioactive fallout spread silently and invisibly around the earth the soviet union stand guilty of a monstrous crime against the human race but the guilt be share by the unite state britain and france the other member of the atomic club until moscow resume nuclear test last september 1 the we and uk have release more than twice a much radiation into the atmosphere a the russian and the fallout from the early blast be still come down a it descend the concentration of radioactivity build up in the human body for a dose of radiation be not like a flu virus which cause temporary discomfort and then die the effect of radiation be cumulative over the year and on to succeed generation so while we properly inveigh against the new poison history be not likely to justify the pose of righteousness which some in the west be so quick to assume when mr khrushchev make he cynical and irresponsible threat shock dismay and foreboding for future generation be legitimate reaction a holier-than-thou sermon be not on october 19 after the soviet have detonate at least 20 nuclear device ambassador stevenson warn the un general assembly that this country in self protection might have to resume above-ground test more recently the chairman of the atomic energy commission dr glenn t seaborg admit to a news conference in la vegas nevada that the we might fall behind russia he apparently mean in weapon development if the soviet continue to test in the atmosphere while we abstain the trial balloon be afloat all of which make it more imperative than ever that the biological and genetic effect of fallout be understand but for the average citizen unfortunately this be one of science s worst-marked channel full of tricky current and unknown depth the scientist in and out of government do not agree on some of the most vital point at least publicly on the one hand the public health service declare a recently a october 26 that present radiation level result from the soviet shot do not warrant undue public concern or any action to limit the intake of radioactive substance by individual or large population group anywhere in the afj but the ph concede that the new radioactive particle will add to the risk of genetic effect in succeed generation and possibly to the risk of health damage to some people in the unite state then it add it be not possible to determine how extensive these ill effect will be nor how many people will be affect have hedge it bet in this way ph apparently decide it would be possible to make some sort of determination after all at present radiation level and even at somewhat high level the additional risk be slight and very few people will be affect then to conclude on an indeterminate note nevertheless if fallout increase substantially or remain high for a long time it would become far more important a a potential health hazard in this country and throughout the world dr linus pauling a nobel prize winner in chemistry have be less ambiguous whether you choose to agree with he or not after declare in an article last month in frontier magazine that the russian test carry with it the possibility of the most tragic consequence of any action in the history of the world he give this estimate of the biologic and genetic consequence if the new soviet shot totale 200 megaton the damage to human germ plasm would be such that in the next few generation 160000 child around the world would be bear with gross physical or mental defect long-lived carbon-14 from the fusion process would cause four million embryonic neonatal or childhood death and stillbirth over the next 20 generation and between 200000 and one million human being now live would have they life cut short by radiation-produced disease such a leukemia most of these would be in the northern hemisphere where the fallout be concentrate pauling s estimate of 200 megaton yield from the present series of russian test will probably turn out to be too high but a total of 100 megaton be a distinct possibility the lack of scientific unanimity on the effect of radiation be due in part to insufficient data cover large population group from which agreed-on generalization could be draw but more than one conscientious researcher have be inhibit from completely frank discussion of the available evidence by the less excusable fact that fallout have be make a political issue a well a a scientific problem it dangerous effect have be downgrade to the public by some who believe national security require far test an illustration of this attitude be find in john a mccone s letter to dr thoma lauritsen report in a note elsewhere in this issue of the new republic to this day the atomic energy commission shy away from discuss the health aspect of fallout a recent study on radiation exposure by the aec s division of biology and medicine state the question of the biological effect of radiation dose be not consider herein of course the aec be in a bind now if it come down too hard on the potential danger of fallout it will box the president on resume atmospheric test so the commission s announcement of the new soviet shot have be confine to one or two bleak sentence with the fission yield usually leave vague now of course that the russian be the nuclear villain radiation be a nasty word than it be in the mid when the we be test in the atmosphere the prevail official attitude then seem to be that fallout if not exactly good for you might not be much bad than a bad cold after a nuclear blast one bureaucrat suggest in those halcyon day about all you have to do be haul out the broom and sweep off you sidewalk and roof thing be nt that simple anymore yet if washington get too indignant about soviet fallout it will have to do a lot of fast footwork if america decide it too must start push up the radiation count how much fallout will we get a of october 25 the aec have report 24 shot in the new soviet series 12 of they in a megaton range include a super bomb with a yield of 30 to 50 megaton the equivalent of 30 million to 50 million ton of tnt and president kennedy indicate there be one or two more than those report assume the low figure for the big blast and one shoot estimate by the japanese at 10 megaton a conservative computation be that the 24 announce test produce a total yield of at least 60 megaton some government scientist say privately that the figure probably be close to 80 megaton and that the full 50-megaton bomb that khrushchev mention may still be detonate if the new soviet series have follow the general pattern of previous russian test the shot be roughly half fission and half fusion mean a fission yield of 30 to 40 megaton thus far to this must be add the 90 to 92 megaton of fission yield produce between the dawn of the atomic age in 1945 and the informal three-power test moratorium that begin in november 1958
