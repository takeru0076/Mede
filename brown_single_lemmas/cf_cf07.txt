some recent writing assume that the ignorant young couple be a thing of the remote victorian past that nowadays all honeymooners be thoroughly familiar with the good sex-manuals and know enough from talk with friend and personal experimentation to take all the anxiety and hazard out of the situation perhaps but extensive discussion with contemporary practitioner family doctor and gynecologists indicate that this be still an area of enormous ignorance joke and talk may be free and easy but the important factual information be still lack for far too many newly-married man and woman various factor in the set can still be of great advantage in make the first intercourse a good rather than a bad memory for one or both privacy must be highly assure both in time and place that be lock the room or stateroom door give privacy of location but it be equally important to be sure there be time enough for an utterly unhurried fulfillment if the wedding party last late and the travel schedule mean there be only a few hour before resume the trip or make an early start the husband may forestall tension and uncertainty by confide to he bride that lie in each other s arm will be bliss enough for these few hour the consummation should come at the next stop place when they have a long private time day or night for that purpose first intercourse for the bride bring with it the various problem connect with virginity and the hymen one thing should be clear to both husband and wife neither pain nor profuse bleed have to occur when the hymen be rupture during the first sex act ignorance on this point have cause a great deal of needless anxiety misunderstanding and suspicion the hymen be in essence a fragile membrane that more or less completely cover the entrance to the vagina in most female human being who have not have sex relation hymen in fact be the greek word for membrane often it be thin and fragile and give way readily to the male organ at the first attempt at intercourse a might be expect girl in this situation bleed very little and perhaps not at all in the process of lose they virginity it be also important to realize that many girl be bear without a hymen or at most only a tiny trace of one so that the absence of the hymen be by no mean positive proof that a girl have have sex relation but there be a basis in fact for the exaggeration of the folk-lore belief some hymen be so strongly develop that they can not be tear without considerable pain to the girl and mark loss of blood more rarely the hymen be so sturdy that it do not yield to penetration extreme case be on record in which the doctor have have to use instrument to cut through the hymen to permit marital relation to be consummate these case for all they rarity be so dramatic that friend and relation repeat the story until the general population may get an entirely false notion of how often the hymen be a serious problem to newly-wed in recent time when sexual matter begin to be discuss more scientifically and more openly the emotional aspect of virginity receive considerable attention obviously the bridal pair have many adjustment to make to they new situation be it necessary to add to the other tension the hazard of make the love husband the one who bring pain to he bride gynecologists and marriage manual begin to advise that the bride should consult a physician before marriage if he foresee any problem because of the quality of the hymen it be recommend that simple procedure be undertake at once to incise the hymen or preferably to dilate it a a natural outgrowth of this approach it be often suggest that the doctor should complete the preparation for painless intercourse by dilate the vagina this recommendation be base on the fact that the hymen be not the only barrier to smooth consummation of the sex act the vagina be an organ capable of remarkable contraction and dilation this be obvious when it be remember that during childbirth the vagina must dilate enough to permit the passage of the baby the intricate system of muscle that manage the contraction and dilatation of the vagina be partly under voluntary control but an instinctive reflex may work against the conscious intention of the woman that be when first penetration take place the pressure and pain signal may involuntarily cause all the vaginal muscle to contract in an effort to bar the intrusion and prevent far pain the advantage of dilatation by the physician be both physical and psychological since it be a purely professional situation none of the pain be associate with love-making or the beloved by use instrument of gradually increase size the vagina be gently and with minimum pain at each stage teach to yield to an object of the appropriate shape in this process the vaginal muscle come under good conscious control by the girl she learn how to relax they to accept instead of contract they to repel the enter object apart from the standard problem of control the vaginal muscle other serious barrier may exist that need special gynecological treatment it be far good to have such condition treat in advance than to have they show up on the honeymoon where they can create a really serious situation when no medical problem exist the newly marry couple generally prefer to cope with the adjustment of they new relationship by themselves special information and guidance about the possible difficulty be still of great value folk-lore superstition and remember passage from erotic literature can create physical and emotional problem if blindly take a scientific fact and useful hint the importance of love tenderness be obvious the long unhurried approach and the deliberate prolongation of fore-play work on several level under the excitement of caress and sexual stimulation the vagina relax and dilate and the local moisture greatly increase provide an excellent lubricant to help achieve an easy penetration extensive observation by physician during vaginal examination have establish the fact that a single finger insert along the anterior wall the top line of the vagina a the woman lie on she back may cause a great deal of distress in a virgin but during the same examination two finger may be insert along the posterior wall the bottom of the vagina in the same position without any pain and in fact without any difficulty if the pressure be keep downward at all time these regional difference of sensitivity to pain may be of crucial significance during the early intercourse the husband and wife should start with this anatomical information clearly in mind they may then adjust they position and movement to avoid too much pressure on the urethra and the anterior wall of the vagina at least until repeat intercourse have dilate it and pain be no long a possible threat against the full pleasure of love-making in fact the technical procedure in medical examination may be wisely adapt to he romantic purpose by the husband during the honeymoon locker-room talk often stress the idea that a man be do the girl a favor if he be forceful and ruthless during the first penetration the false reason be that a gradual advance prolong the pain while a swift powerful act get it over with and leave the girl please with he virility and grateful for he decisiveness in settle the problem once and for all such talk be seriously in error ruthlessness at this time can be a very severe shock to the bride both physically and psychologically the insistent forceful penetration may tear and inflame the vaginal wall a well a do excessive damage to the hymen the pain and distress associate with the performance may easily give the wife a deep-seated dread of marital relation and cause she unconsciously to make the sex act unpleasant and difficult for both by exercise she vaginal muscle to complicate he penetration instead of relax they to facilitate it serious attention must also be give to the husband s problem in the honeymoon situation the necessity for keep alert to he bride s hazard can act a an interference with the man s spontaneous desire the emotional stimulation may be so great that he may experience a premature climax this be a very common experience and should in no way discourage or dishearten either husband or wife or the frequent need to check and discipline himself to the wise pace of the consummation can put he off stride and make it impossible for he to be continuously ready for penetration over a long period the signal to proceed may therefore come when he be momentarily not able to take advantage of they the good course be to recover he physical excitement by a change of pace that make he ardent again this may require imagination and remind himself that now he can be demand and self-centered he can take security from the fact that the progress he have make by he gentle approach will not be lose now while he use talk caress or require caress from she he bride will sympathetically understand the situation and eagerly help he restore he physical situation so they can have the consummation they both so eagerly desire a final word the accumulate information on this point show that first intercourse even when it be achieve with minimum pain or difficulty be seldom an overwhelming sexual experience to a woman too many new thing be happen for it to be a complete erotic fulfillment only under rare circumstance would a bride experience an orgasm during she first intercourse both man and wife should be aware of the fact that a lack of climax and even the absence of the anticipate keen pleasure be not a sign that the wife may be cold or frigid if the early approach be wise understand and patient the satisfaction of marital fulfillment will probably be discover before the marriage be much old write in a large volume on the nude in painting and sculpture title the nude a study in ideal form kenneth clark declare the human body a a nucleus be rich in association it be ourselves and arouse memory of all the thing we wish to do with ourselves perhaps this be a clue to the amaze variety and power of reaction attitude and emotion precipitate by the nude form the wide divergence of reaction be clearly illustrate in the kinsey study in human sexuality difference be relate to social economic and educational background whereas person of eighth grade education or less be more apt to avoid or be shock by nudity those educate beyond the eighth grade increasingly welcome and approve nudity in sexual relation such understand help to explain why one matron celebrate thirty-five year of marry life could declare with some pride that she husband have never see she entirely naked while another woman boast an equal number of year of marry life be proud of have share the nudist way of life the really free natural nude life for most of that period attempt at censorship always involve and reveal such complex and multiple individual reaction the indignant crusader see the nude or semi-nude human form a lewd and pornographic a threat and danger to all the young or good or religious or moral person the equally ardent proponent of freedom from any kind of censorship may find the nude human form the natural honest free expression of man s spirit and the epitome of beauty and inspiration one be always a little surprise to bump into such individual distinction when it be unexpect i still recall the mild shock i experience in read material of an enthusiastic advocate of the clean healthful free way of natural life in nudism who seem to brave much misunderstanding and persecution in fine spirit
