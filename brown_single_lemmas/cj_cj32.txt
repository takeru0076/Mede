the many linguistic technique for reduce the amount of dictionary information that have be propose all organize the dictionary s content around prefix stem suffix etc a significant reduction in the voume of store information be thus realize especially for a highly inflect language such a russian for english the reduction in size be less strike this approach require that 1 each text word be separate into small element to establish a correspondence between the occurrence and dictionary entry and 2 the information retrieve from several entry in the dictionary be synthesize into a description of the particular word the logical scheme use to accomplish the former influence the placement of information in the dictionary file implementation of the latter require storage of information need only for synthesis we suggest the application of certain data-processing technique a a solution to the problem but first we must define two term so that they mean will be clearly understand form any unique sequence of alphabetic character that can appear in a language precede and follow by a space occurrence an instance of a form in text we propose a method for select only dictionary information require by the text be translate and a mean for pass the information directly to the occurrence in text we accomplish this by compile a list of text form a text be read by the computer a random-storage scheme base on the spell of form provide an economical way to compile this text-form list dictionary form find to match form in the text list be mark a location in the computer store be also name for each mark form dictionary information about the form store at this location can be retrieve directly by occurrence of the form in text finally information be retrieve from the dictionary a require by stage of the translation process the grammatical description for sentence-structure determination equivalent-choice information for semantic analysis and target-language equivalent for output construction the dictionary be a form dictionary at least in the sense that complete form be use a the basis for match text occurrence with dictionary entry also the dictionary be divide into at least two part the list of dictionary form and the file of information that pertain to these form a more detail description of dictionary operation text lookup and dictionary modification give a clear picture text lookup a we will describe it consist of three step the first be compile a list of text form assign an information cell to each and replace text occurrence with the information cell assign to the form of each occurrence for this step the computer memory be separate into three region cell in the w-region be use for storage of the form in the text-form list cell in the x-region and y region be reserve a information cell for text form when an occurrence afj be isolate during text read a random memory address afj the address of a cell in the x-region be compute from the form of afj let afj denote the form of afj if cell afj have not previously be assign a the information cell of a form in the text-form list it be now assign a the information cell of afj the form itself be store in the next available cell of the w-region begin in cell afj the address afj and the number of cell require to store the form be write in afj the information cell afj be save to represent the text occurrence text read continue with the next occurrence let we assume that afj be identical to the form of an occurrence afj which precede afj in the text when this situation exist the address afj will equal afj which be produce from afj if afj be assign a the information cell for afj the routine can detect that afj be identical to afj by compare afj with the form store at location afj the address afj be store in the cell afj when a in this case the two form match the address afj be save to represent the occurrence afj text read continue with the next occurrence a third situation be possible the formula for compute random address from the form of each occurrence will not give a distinct address for each distinct form thus when more than one distinct form lead to a particular cell in the x-region a chain of information cell must be create to accommodate the form one cell in the chain for each form if afj lead to an address afj that be equal to the address compute from afj even though afj do not match afj the chain of information cell be extend from afj by store the address of the next available cell in the y-region afj in afj the cell afj become the second information cell in the chain and be assign a the information cell of afj a third cell can be add by store the address of another y-cell in afj similarly a many cell be add a be require each information cell in the chain contain the address of the y-cell where the form to which it be assign be store each cell except the last in the chain also contain the address of the y-cell that be the next element of the chain the absence of such a link in the last cell indicate the end of the chain hence when the address afj be compute from afj the cell afj and all y-cell in it chain must be inspect to determine whether afj be already in the form list or whether it should be add to the form list and the chain when the information cell for afj have be determine it be save a a representation of afj text read continue with the next occurrence text read be terminate when a pre-determined number of form have be store in the text-form list this initiate the second step of glossary lookup connect the information cell of form in the text-form list to dictionary form each form represent by the dictionary be look up in the text-form list each time a dictionary form match a text form the information cell of the match text form be save the number of dictionary form skip since the last one match be also save these two piece of information for each dictionary form that be match by a text form constitute the table of dictionary usage if each text form be mark when match with a dictionary form the text form not contain in the dictionary can be identify when all dictionary form have be read the appropriate action for handle these form can be take at that time each dictionary form be look up in the text-form list by the same method use to look up a new text occurrence in the form list during text read a random address afj that lie within the x-region of memory mention early be compute from the i-th dictionary form if cell afj be an information cell it and any information cell in the y-region that have be link to afj each contain an address in the w-region where a potentially match form be store the dictionary form be compare with each of these text form when a match be find an entry be make in the table of dictionary usage if cell afj be not an information cell we conclude that the i-th dictionary form be not in the text list these two step essentially complete the lookup operation the final step merely use the table of dictionary usage to select the dictionary information that pertain to each form match in the text-form list and use the list of information cell record in text order to attach the appropriate information to each occurrence in text the list of text form in the w-region of memory and the content of the information cell in the x and y-regions be no long require only the assignment of the information cell be important the first stage of translation after glossary lookup be structural analysis of the input text the grammatical description of each occurrence in the text must be retrieve from the dictionary to permit such an analysis a description of this process will serve to illustrate how any type of information can be retrieve from the dictionary and attach to each text occurrence the grammatical description of all form in the dictionary be record in a separate part of the dictionary file the order be identical to the order of the form they describe when entry be be retrieve from this file the table of dictionary usage indicate which entry to skip and which entry to store in the computer this selection-rejection process take place a the file be read each entry that be select for storage be write into the next available cell of the afj the address of the first cell and the number of cell use be write in the information cell for the form the address of the information cell be also supply by the table of dictionary usage when the complete file have be read the grammatical description for all text form find in the dictionary have be store in the w-region the information cell assign to each text form contain the address of the grammatical description of the form it represent hence the description of each text occurrence can be retrieve by read the list of text-ordered information-cell address and output the description indicate by the information cell for each occurrence the only requirement on dictionary information make by the text-lookup operation be that each form represent by the dictionary be available for lookup in the text-form list and that information for each form be available in a sequence identical with the sequence of the form this leave the order of entry variable here an entry be a form plus the information that pertain to it two very useful way for modify a form-dictionary be the addition to the dictionary of complete paradigm rather than single form and the application of a single change to more than one dictionary form the former be intend to decrease the amount of work necessary to extend dictionary coverage the latter be useful for modify information about some or all form of a word hence reduce the work require to improve dictionary content apply the technique develop at harvard for generate a paradigm from a representative form and it classification we can add all form of a word to the dictionary at once an extension of the principle would permit enter a grammatical description of each form equivalent could be assign to the paradigm either at the time it be add to the dictionary or after the word have be study in context thus one can think of a dictionary entry a a word rather than a form if all form of a paradigm be group together within the dictionary a considerable reduction in the amount of information require be possible for example the inflect form of a word can be represent insofar a regular inflection allow by a stem and a set of ending to be attach indeed the set of ending can be replace by the name of a set of ending the full form can be derive from such information just prior to the lookup of the form in the text-form list similarly if the equivalent for the form of a word do not vary the equivalent need be enter only once with an indication that they apply to each form the dictionary system be in no way dependent upon such summarization or design around it when irregularity and variation prevent summarize information be write in complete detail entry be summarize only when by do so the amount of information retain in the dictionary be reduce and the time require for dictionary operation be decrease
