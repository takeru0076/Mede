the sane society be an ambitious work it scope be a broad a the question what do it mean to live in modern society a work so broad even when it be direct by a lead idea and inform by a moral vision must necessarily fail even a hasty reader will easily find in it numerous blind spot error of fact and argument important exclusion area of ignorance and prejudice undue emphases on trivia example of broad position support by flimsy evidence and the like such book be easy prey for critic nor need the critic be captious a careful and orderly man who value precision and a kind of tough intellectual responsibility might easily be put off by such a book it be a simple matter for one so dispose to take a work like the sane society and shred it into odds and end the thing can be make to look like the clutter attic of a large and vigorous family a motley jumble of discard object some outworn and some that be never useful some once whole and bright but now chip and tarnish some odd piece whose history no one remember here and there a gem everything fascinate because it suggest some part of the human condition the whole add up to nothing more than a glimpse into the disorderly history of the maker and user that could be easily do but there be little reason in it it would come down to say that fromm paint with a broad brush and that after all be not a conclusion one must work toward but an impression he have from the outset i mention these feature of the book because they be inherent in the book s character and therefore must be mention it would be superfluous to build a critique around they there be more substantial criticism to be make of fromm s account of capitalist civilization it be worthwhile to recall that fromm s treatment have both descriptive and normative aspect since i have already discuss he moral position that discussion be incorporate by reference into the follow page which will focus on the empirical and analytic side of fromm s treatment i shall first indicate a couple of weakness in fromm s analysis then argue that grant these weakness he still have much leave that be valuable and finally raise the general question of a philosophical versus a sociological approach to the question of alienation almost no empirical work have be do on the problem of alienation despite it rather long intellectual history alienation be still a promise hypothesis and not a verify theory the idea have receive much attention in philosophy in literature and in a few work of general social criticism such a the sane society what be miss be work that would answer presumably by the use of survey method and guttman-type attitude scale such question a these what be the component of the feeling-state describe a alienation how widespread be alienation what be it incidence among the various class and subgroup of the population take alienation a a dependent variable with what socio-structural factor be it most highly associate consider a an independent variable how do it affect behavior in various sector of life until such work be do there must remain the nag suspicion that alienation may be little more than an expression of the malaise of the intellectual who reject by and in turn reject the large society project he own fear and despair onto the broad social screen i be not suggest that fromm ought to do this kind of work nor do i think that alienation be nothing more than a projection of the malaise of the intellectual i be say only that until a full and different kind of evidence come in any discussion of alienation must be understand to have certain important limitation until such evidence appear we must make do with the evidence we have here perhaps fromm be vulnerable for he do not always use the good and most recent evidence available and he sometimes select and interpret the evidence in rather special way three example follow fromm s analysis of alienation in the sphere of production center around the concept of the bureaucratization of the corporation the separation of ownership from control and the broad and thus from the point of view of corporate control ineffective dispersion of stock ownership for all these point he rely exclusively on berle and mean s study of 1932 the modern corporation and private property the broad conclusion of that pioneer work remain undisturbed but subsequent research have expand and somewhat alter they empirical support have suggest important revision in the general analytic frame of reference and have sharpen the mean of particular analytic concept in this area fromm seem unaware of these development another example be he very infrequent use of the large amount of data from survey design to discover what and how people actually do feel and think on a broad range of topic he cite such survey-type finding just three time moreover the conclusion he draw from the finding be not always the only one possible for example he cite the follow data from two study on job satisfaction in the first study 85 per cent of professional and executive 64 per cent of white collar people and 41 per cent of factory worker express satisfaction with they job in the second study the percentage be 86 for professional 74 for managerial person 42 for commercial employee 56 for skilled worker and 48 for semi-skilled worker he conclude that these data show a remarkably high percentage of consciously dissatisfied and unhappy person among factory and clerical worker start from other value premise than fromm s some analyst might conclude that the percentage really tell we very little at all while other might even conclude that the figure be remarkably low eric hoffer for example once say that america be a paradise the only one in the history of the world for workingman and small child what matter be that while fromm s read of the data be not the only one possible it be precisely the one we would expect from a writer who earnestly believe that every man can and ought to be happy and satisfy fromm also cite a poll on attitude toward work restriction conduct by the opinion research corporation in 1945 in which 49 per cent of manual worker say a man ought to turn out a much a he could in a day s work while 41 per cent say he should not do he good but should turn out only the average amount fromm say these data show that job dissatisfaction and resentment be widespread that be one way to read the finding but again there be other way one might use such finding to indicate the strength of informal primary association in the factory an interpretation which would run counter to fromm s theory of alienation or he might remind fromm that the 41 per cent figure be really astonishingly low after all the medieval guild system be dedicate to the proposition that 100 per cent of the worker ought to turn out only the average amount and today s trade union announce pretty much the same view in view of these shortcoming in both the amount and the interpretation of survey-type finding on public opinion and consider the criticism which can be bring against fromm s philosophical anthropology such a passage a the follow can not be take seriously be people happy be they a satisfy unconsciously a they believe themselves to be consider the nature of man and the condition for happiness this can hardly be so the ambiguity suggest above stem from a more basic difficulty in fromm s style of think he seem to use the term alienation in two different way sometimes he use it a a subjective descriptive term and sometimes a an objective diagnostic one that be sometimes it be use to describe feel human misery and other time it be postulate to explain unfelt anxiety and discontent the failure to keep these two usage distinct present hazard to the reader it also permit fromm to do some dubious thing with empirical finding when alienation be use a an objective and diagnostic category for example it become clear that fromm would have to say that awareness of alienation go far toward conquer it he in effect do say this in he discussion of the pseudo-happiness of the automaton conformist start from this and accept he estimate of the iniquity of modern society it would follow that the really disturb evidence of alienation would be that of a work-satisfaction survey which report widespread state worker satisfaction rather than widespread state worker dissatisfaction the point be that in a system such a fromm s which recognize unconscious motivation and which rest on certain ethical absolute empirical data can be use to support whatever proposition the writer be urge at the moment thus in the example cite above fromm rest he whole case on the premise that the worker be be deprive unconsciously unknowingly of fulfillment and then support this with survey data report conscious experience frustration he have he cake and eat it too if the worker say they be dissatisfied this show conscious alienation if they say they be satisfy this show unconscious alienation this sort of manipulation be especially troublesome in fromm s work because although he system be derive largely from certain philosophic conviction he assert that it be base on empirical finding draw both from social science and from he own consult room while the empirical psychoanalytic label which fromm claim shed no light on the validity of he underlie philosophy it do increase the marketability of he product the final example of the failure to use available evidence though evidence of a different kind from that which have so far be consider come from fromm s treatment of some other writer who have deal with the same theme in a brief chapter deal with various other diagnosis he quote isolate passage from some writer whose view seem to corroborate he own and find it most remarkable that a critical view of twentieth-century society be already hold by a number of thinker live in the nineteenth he find it equally remarkable that they critical diagnosis and prognosis should have so much in common among themselves and with the critic of the twentieth century there be nothing remarkable about this at all it be largely a matter of find passage that suit one s purpose there be a difference between evidence and illustration and fromm s citation of the other diagnostician fit the latter category glance at the list burckhardt tolstoy proudhon thoreau london marx tawney mayo durkheim tannenbaum mumford ar heron huxley schweitzer and einstein this be a delightfully motley collection one can make they say the same thing only by not listen to they very carefully and hear only what one want to hear the method of selection fromm use achieve exactly that furthermore the list be interest for it omission it omit for example practically the whole line of great nineteenth century english social critic nearly all the great writer whose basic position be religious and all those who be with more or less accuracy call existentialist of course the list also exclude all writer who be fairly optimistic about the modern situation these almost by definition be spokesman for an alienate ideology it be not hard to find that concurrence of opinion which fromm find so remarkable when you ignore all who hold a different opinion turn from these problem of the use of evidence one meet another type of difficulty in fromm s analysis which be he loose and ambiguous use of certain important term one such instance have already be present he use of alienation the only other one i shall mention here be he use of the term capitalism for fromm capitalism be the enemy the root of all evil it be of course useful to have a sovereign cause on one s social criticism for it make diagnosis and prescription much easy than they might otherwise be
