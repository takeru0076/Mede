a proton magnetic resonance study of polycrystalline afj a a function of magnetic field and temperature be present afj be paramagnetic and electron paramagnetic dipole a well a nuclear dipole effect lead to line broaden the line be asymmetric and over the range of field afj gauss and temperature afj the asymmetry increase with increase afj and decrease t an isotropic resonance shift of afj to low apply field indicate a weak isotropic hyperfine contact interaction the general theory of resonance shift be use to derive a general expression for the second moment afj of a polycrystalline paramagnetic sample and be specialize to afj the theory predict a linear dependence of afj on afj where j be the experimentally determine curie-weiss constant the experimental second moment afj conform to the relation afj in agreement with theory hence the electron paramagnetic effect slope can be separate from the nuclear effect intercept the paramagnetic dipole effect provide some information on the particle shape the nuclear dipole effect provide some information on the motion of the hydrogen nucleus but the symmetry of the afj bond in afj remain in doubt introduction the magnetic moment of an unpaired electron associate nearby may have a tremendous influence on the magnetic resonance property of nucleus it be important to consider and experimentally verify this influence since quantitative nuclear resonance be become increasingly use in investigation of structure afj appear to be well suit for the study of these matter since it be a normal paramagnet with three unpaired electron on the chromium it crystal structure be very simple and the unknown position of the hydrogen in the strong afj bond provide structural interest we first discuss the afj bond in afj we then outline the theory of the interaction of paramagnetic dipole with nucleus and show that the theory be in excellent agreement with experiment indeed it be possible to separate electron paramagnetic from nuclear effect the information provide by the electron paramagnetic effect be then discuss and finally the nuclear effect be interpret in term of various motional-modified model of the afj bond in af afj bond in afj theoretical study of the hydrogen bond generally agree that the afj bond will be linear in the absence of peculiarity of pack in the solid moreover it will be asymmetric until a certain critical afj distance be reach below which it will become symmetric there be ample evidence from many source that the afj bond in afj be symmetric the afj distance in afj be 226 afj there be evidence though less convince than for afj that the afj bond in nickel dimethylglyoxime be symmetric here the afj distance be 244 afj a number of semiempirical estimate by various worker lead to the conclusion that the afj bond become symmetric when the afj bond length be about 24 to 25 a but aside from the possible example of nickel dimethylglyoxime there have be no convince report of symmetric afj bond douglass have study the crystal structure of afj by x-ray diffraction he find the structure contain an afj bond with the afj distance of afj there be then the possibility that this afj bond be symmetric although douglass be unable to determine it symmetry from he x-ray data douglass find afj to be trigonal laue symmetry afj with afj afj x-ray and experimental density show one formula unit in the unit cell correspond to a paramagnetic ion density of afj the x-ray data do not permit douglass to determine uniquely the space group but a negative test for piezoelectricity lead he to assume a center of symmetry under this assumption the space group must be afj and the follow be the position of the atom in the unit cell afj this space group require the hydrogen bond to be symmetric douglass find powder intensity calculation and measurement to agree good for afj these data lead to a structure in which sheet of cr atom lie between two sheet of o atom the o atom in each sheet be close pack and each cr atom be surround by a distort octahedron of o atom the afj layer be stack normal to the 111 axis with the low oxygen of one layer directly above the upper oxygen of the neighboring low layer in such a manner that the repeat be every three layer the separate layer be join together by hydrogen bond a draw of the structure be to be find in reference 6 the gross detail of the structure appear reasonable the structure appear to be unique among ooh compound but be the same a that assume by afj the bond angle and distance be all within the expect limit and the volume per oxygen be about normal however the possible absence of a center of symmetry not only move the hydrogen atom off afj but also allow the oxygen atom to become nonequivalent with afj at afj and afj at afj space group afj where afj represent the oxygen on one side of the afj layer and afj those on the other side however any oxygen nonequivalence would shorten either the already extremely short afj interlayer distance of 255 a or the non-hydrogen-bonded afj interlayer interaction which be already quite short at 258 afj hence it be difficult to conceive of a pack of the atom in this material in which the oxygen atom be far from geometrical equivalence the only effect of lack of a center would then be to release the hydrogen atom to occupy general rather than special position along the 111 axis if the afj bond be linear then there be three reasonable position for the hydrogen atom 1 the hydrogen atom be center and hence all lie on a sheet midway between the oxygen sheet 2 all hydrogen atom lie on a sheet but the sheet be close to one oxygen sheet than to the other 3 hydrogen atom be asymmetrically place either randomly or in an order way so that some hydrogen atom be close to the upper oxygen atom while other be close to the low oxygen atom position 2 appear to we to be unlikely in view of the absence of a piezoelectric effect and on general chemical structural ground a randomization of up and down be more likely than order up and down in position 3 since the hydrogen atom be well separate and so the position of one could hardly affect the position of another and also since order up and down imply a large unit cell for which no evidence exist therefore the only unknown structural feature would appear to be whether the hydrogen atom be locate symmetrically 1 or asymmetrically 3 experimental procedure sample douglass prepare he sample of afj by thermal decomposition of aqueous chromic acid at 300 - 325-degrees-c dr douglass be kind enough to lend we about 5 gram of he material this material prove to be unsatisfactory since we could not obtain reproducible result on various portion of the sample subsequently we learn from douglass that he sample contain a few percent afj impurity since afj be ferromagnetic we feel that any result obtain from the magnetically contaminate afj would be suspect plane suggest another preparation of afj which we use here 500 ml of 1m aqueous afj with 1 afj add be heat in a bomb at 170-degrees-c for 48 hour a very fine gray solid about 15 g be form water-washed by centrifugation and dry at 110-degrees-c differential thermal analysis show a very small endothermic reaction at 340-degrees-c and a large endothermic reaction at 470-degrees-c this latter reaction be in accord with the report decomposition of afj thermogravimetric analysis show a weight loss of 18 % center at 337-degrees-c and another weight loss of 108 % at 463-degrees-c the expect weight loss for afj go to afj and afj be 106 % mass spectrometric analysis of gas evolve upon heat to 410-degrees-c indicate nitrogen oxide and water vapor the small reaction occur at 337-degrees-c be probably cause by decomposition of occlude nitrate and perhaps by a small amount of some hydrous material other than afj all subsequent measurement be make on material which have be heat to 375-degrees-c for one hour emission spectrum indicate afj calcium and all other impurity much low chromium analysis give 588 % cr a compare with 612 % theory however afj adsorb water from the atmosphere and this may account for the low chromium analysis and high total weight loss the x-ray diffraction pattern of the material take with cuk \*\* you radiation indicate the presence of no extra line and be in good agreement with the pattern of douglass magnetic analysis by rg meisenheimer of this laboratory indicate no ferromagnetic impurity afj be find to be paramagnetic with three unpaired electron per chromium atom and a molecular susceptibility of afj where afj for exactly three unpaired electron the coefficient would be 310 an infrared spectrum obtain by ha benesi and rg snyder of this laboratory show band in the position find by jones electron microscopic examination of the afj sample show it to be compose of nearly isotropic particle about 03m in diameter the particle appear rough and undoubtedly the single-crystal domain be small than this the x-ray data be consistent with particle size of 1000 a or great we find no obvious effect due to prefer orientation of the crystallite in this sample nor would we expect to on the basis of the shape find from electron microscopic examination nuclear magnetic resonance nmr measurement the magnetic resonance absorption be detect by employ a varian model afj broad line spectrometer and the associate 12-inch electromagnet system one measurement at 40 mc be obtain with the varian model afj unit a bridged-t type of bridge be use in the 10 - 16 mc range the rf power level be maintain small enough at all time to prevent obvious line shape distortion by saturation effect a modulation frequency of 40 cps with an amplitude a small a possible commensurate with reasonably good signal-to-noise quality be use background spectrum be obtain in all case the spectrometer be adjust to minimize the amount of dispersion mode mix in with the absorption signal a single value of the thermal relaxation time afj at room temperature be measure by the progressive saturation method the value of afj estimate at 470 gauss be afj microsecond a single measurement of the spin - spin relaxation time afj be obtain at 10 mc by pulse method this measurement be obtain by w blumberg of the university of california berkeley by observe the breadth of the free induction decay signal the value derive be 16 microsecond field shift be derive from the mean value of the resonance line define a the field about which the first moment be zero second moment of the spectrum be compute by numerical integration correction be apply for modulation broaden apparatus background and field shift spectrum be obtain over the temperature range of 77 - 294-degrees-k for the low-temperature measurement the sample be cool by a cold nitrogen gas flow method similar to that of andrew and eades the temperature be maintain to within about afj for the period of time require to make the measurement usually about one hour one sample which have be expose to the atmosphere after evacuation at 375-degrees-c show the presence of adsorb water about 03 wt a evidence by a weak resonance line which be very narrow at room temperature and which disappear due to broaden at low temperature the data report here be either from spectrum from which the adsorb water resonance could easily be eliminate or from spectrum of sample evacuate and seal off at 375-degrees-c which contain no adsorb water the measure powder density of the afj use here be about afj approximately one-third that of the crystal density afj such a density correspond to a paramagnetic ion density of about afj spectrum be obtain from a powder sample have the shape of a right circular cylinder with a height-to-diameter ratio of 4 1 the top of the sample be nearly flat and the bottom hemispherical spectrum be also obtain from a sample in a spherical container which be make by blow a bubble on the end of a capillary glass tube the bubble be fill to the top and special precaution be take to prevent any sample from remain in the capillary spectrum be also obtain from a third sample of afj which have be dilute to three time it original volume with powder anhydrous alundum afj this sample be contain in a cylindrical container similar to that describe above
