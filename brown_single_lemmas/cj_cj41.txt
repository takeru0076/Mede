wage-price policy of industry be the result of a complex of force no single explanation have be find which apply to all case the purpose of this paper be to analyze one possible force which have not be treat in the literature but which we believe make a significant contribution to explain the wage-price behavior of a few very important industry while there may be several such industry to which the model of this paper be applicable the author make particular claim of relevance to the explanation of the course of wage and price in the steel industry of the unite state since world war 2 indeed the apparent stiffen of the industry s attitude in the recent steel strike have a direct explanation in term of the model here present the model of this paper consider an industry which be not characterize by vigorous price competition but which be so basic that it wage-price policy be hold in check by continuous critical public scrutiny where the industry s product price have be keep below the profit-maximizing and entry-limiting price due to fear of public reaction the profit seek producer have an interest in offer little real resistance to wage demand the contribution of this paper be a demonstration of this proposition and an exploration of some of it implication in order to focus clearly upon the operation of this one force which we may call the effect of public-limit price on key wage bargain we deliberately simplify the model by abstract from other force such a union power which may be relevant in an actual situation for expository purpose this be good treat a a model which spell out the condition under which an important industry affect with the public interest would find it profitable to raise wage even in the absence of union pressure for high wage part 1 below describe this abstract model by spell out it assumption part 2 discuss the operation of the model and derive some significant conclusion part 3 discuss the empirical relevance and policy implication of the conclusion part 4 be a brief summary the mathematical appendix present the rigorous argument but be good read after part 1 in order that the assumption underlie the equation may be explicit 1 the assumption of the model a the industry the industry with which this model be concern be a basic industry produce a substantial share of gross national product price competition be lack for the purpose of set the product price the industry behave a a single entity in wage negotiation the industry bargain a a unit with a single union b the demand for the industry s product we be concern with aggregate demand for the industry s product the manner in which this be share among firm be take a give in any give time period the aggregate demand for the industry s product be determine by two thing the price charge by the industry and the level of afj for the purpose of this discussion the problem of relative price be encompass in these two variable since gnp include other price we abstract here from technological progress and assume that price of all other product change proportionately the form of the industry demand function be one which make quantity demand vary inversely with the product price and vary directly with the level of afj c industry product price policy the industry of this model be so important that it wage and price policy be affect with a public interest because of it importance and because the lack of price competition be well recognize the industry be under considerable public pressure not to raise it price any more than could be justify by cost increase the threat of effective anti-trust action provoke by gouge the public through price increase not justify by cost increase and fear of endanger relation with customer congress the general public and the press all operate to keep price increase in some relation to cost increase for the industry of this model the effect of such public pressure in the past have be to hold the price well below the short-run profit-maximizing price give the wage rate and the level of gnp and even below the entry-limited price but not below average cost for such an industry it be only safe to raise it price if such an increase be manifestly justify by rise cost due to rise wage etc thus if public pressure set the effective limit to the price that the industry may charge this pressure be itself a function of the wage rate in this model we abstract from all non-wage source of cost change so that the public-limit price only rise a the wage rate rise in such circumstance it may well be to the advantage of the industry to allow an increase in the basic wage rate since marginal cost rise when the wage rate rise the profit-maximizing price also rise when the public-limit price be elevate and be likely to remain well above the latter the entry-limiting price will also be raise for potential domestic competition but unless general inflation permit profit margin to increase proportionately throughout the economy we might expect the public-limit price to approach the entry-limit price the foreign-entry-limit price would be approach more rapidly since domestic wage-rates do not enter foreign cost directly where this approach become critical the industry can be expect to put much emphasis on this a evidence of it sincerity in resist the wage pressure of a powerful union request tariff relief after it have reluctantly accede to the union pressure whether or not it be in the industry s interest to allow the basic wage rate to rise obviously depend upon the extent to which the public-limit price rise in response to a basic wage increase and the relation of this response to the increase in cost accompany the wage increase the extent to which the public-limit price be raise by a give increase in the basic wage rate be itself a function of three thing the passage of time the level of gnp and the size of the wage increase we be abstract from the fact of strike here but it should be obvious that the extent to which the public-limit price be raise by a give increase in the basic wage rate be also a function of the show of resistance put up by the industry the industry may deliberately take a strike not to put pressure on the union but in order to educate the government and the customer of the industry a a strike continue these party increase they pressure on the industry to reach an agreement they become increasingly will to accept the price increase that the industry claim the wage bargain would entail public indignation and resistance to wage-price increase be obviously much less when the increase be on the order of 3 % per annum than when the increase be on the order of 3 % per month the simple passage of an additional eleven month time make the second 3 % boost more acceptable thus the public-limit price be raise far by a give wage increase the long it have be since the previous price increase notice however that the passage of time do not permit the raise of price per se without an accompany wage increase similarly high level of gnp do not in themselves provide ground for raise price but they do relax some of the pressure on the industry so that it can raise price high for a give wage increase this be not extend to anticipate level of gnp however only the current level of gnp affect the public pressure against wage-price increase finally since the public require some restraint on the part of the company large wage increase call for less than proportionately large price increase eg if a wage increase of 5 % allow a price increase of 7 % a wage increase of 10 % allow a price increase of something less than 14 % d industry cost we assume that average total unit cost in the relevant region of operation be constant with respect to quantity produce the average cost curve be horizontal and therefore be identical with the marginal cost curve and be the same for every firm and therefore for the industry the level of this average cost be determine by factor price technology and so forth a we have note however we be abstract from change in all determinant of this level except for change in the wage rate the level of average cost equal to marginal cost be thus strictly a function of the wage rate e union policy and collective bargain issue the single union which face the industry do not restrict it membership and there be an adequate supply of labor available to the firm of the industry at the go wage rate the union do not regard unemployment of it own member a a matter of concern when set it own wage policy it concern with employment make itself feel in pressure upon the government to maintain full employment the union vigorously demand wage increase from productivity increase and wage increase to offset cost-of-living increase but we abstract from these force here for we present purpose we assume that the sole subject of bargain be the basic wage rate not include productivity improvement factor or cost-of-living adjustment and it be this basic wage rate which determine the level of cost productivity be something of an amorphous concept and the amount of productivity increase in a give time period be not even well know to the industry much less to the union or to the public disagreement on the amount of productivity increase exacerbate the problem of agree how an increase in profit margin relate to a productivity increase should be share the existence of conflict and of vigorous union demand for an increase in money wage do not contradict the assumption that the union be will to settle for cost-of-living and productivity-share increase a distinct from a cost-raising increase in the basic wage rate we assume far that the union recognize the possibility that price-level increase may offset wage-rate increase and it do not entirely disregard the effect of price increase arise from it own wage increase upon the real wage rate for internal political reason the union ask for and accept increase in the basic wage rate and would vigorously oppose a reduction in this rate but the adjustment of the basic wage rate upwards be essentially up to the discretion of the company of the industry change in the basic wage rate be cost-raising and they constitute an argument for raise price however it be not know to either the union or the public precisely how much of a cost increase be cause by a give change in the basic wage rate although the company be presume to have reliable estimate of this magnitude in this model then the industry be presume to realize that they could successfully resist a change in the basic wage rate but since such a change be the only effective mean to raise price they may in circumstance to be spell out in part 2 below find it to they advantage to allow the wage rise thus for non-negative change in the basic wage rate the industry become the active wage-setter since any increase in the basic wage rate can occur only by reason of industry acquiescence the presumption in the literature would appear to be that the basic wage rate would be unchanged in this case on the ground that it be clearly not in the interest of the industry to raise wage gratuitously from this presumption it be an easy step to the conclusion that any observe increase in the basic wage rate must be due to union behavior different and more aggressive than assume in we model it be this conclusion that we challenge we do so by disprove the presumption on which it be base 2 the operation of the model it be convenient to assume that the union-industry contract be of one year s duration
