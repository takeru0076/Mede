lucas s article in sr s april 1 issue seem to be a very fair and objective analysis of the new english bible i certainly hope this will be the impression leave in the mind of reader rather than the comment by cleveland amory in he first of the month column it be blind fundamentalist dogmatism to say mess around with the king jame version seem to we a perilous sport at good fact in focus lester markel be on the right track in he article interpretation of interpretation sr mar 11 the current stereotype of straight news report be probably invaluable in protect the press and it reader from pollution by that combination of doctore fact fancy and personal opinion call yellow journalism which flourish in this country more than a generation ago we do nt need this type of protection any more the public be now arm with sophistication and numerous compete media besides there be no long enough corruptible journalist about the accept method of write news have two major liability first it do not communicate a reporter restrict to the compete propaganda statement of both side in a major labor dispute for instance be unable to tell he reader half of what he know about the cause of the dispute second it subject the news to distortion by the unscrupulous the charge by the late junior senator from wisconsin not only destroy innocent people but mislead the nation yet the press be powerless to put these charge in perspective in it news column despite several year of front-page story the average citizen be unable to get a complete picture of mccarthy until he see on the television screen what the reporter have be see all along but have no effective way of communicate the senator have box they in with they own restriction it seem to i the time have come for the american press to start experiment with way of report the news that will do a good job of communicate and will be less subject to abuse by those who have learn how to manipulate the present stereotype to serve they own end the objective should be to provide a method of get into print a high percentage than be now possible of the relevant information in the possession of reporter and editor southern california blackout i would like to see you devote some space in an early issue to the news blackout concern president kennedy s activity so far a southern california be concern you have on more than one occasion praise the idea of a televise press conference and the chance it give the people to form intelligent opinion to begin with the all-powerful los angeles time do not publish a transcript of these press conference i be sure that they do when eisenhower be president next because of the time differential the conference come on the network during the middle of the day up until now the network have grudgingly run half-hour tape at 5 pm or sometimes 7 or 1030 pm even then a few of the less interest question be edit out and glibly summarize by a commentator however last night the tape be not run at all during the even hour and all we get on tv be a few snatch which douglas edwards and huntley and brinkley could squeeze into they program this be no criticism of they a they obviously can not get a half-hour program into a fifteen-minute news summary the radio station do run transcript i think during the even hour however by compare the tv snatch two different radio station re-run and the censor los angeles time version i find that the radio station have edit out question abc remove the one regard laos or even a paragraph out of the middle of the president s answer i be interest to know he be get mail from all over the country about the abuse he be be subject to we out here do nt see enough of the conference to know he be be abuse i do nt know if this be the situation in other part of the country apparently it be not it also happen with the inauguration which be not re-run at all during the even hour and i write to the tv editor of the time he do mention in he column the fact that he have receive many letter about this and he himself do not understand the network and the independent local station not do this but nothing happen can you bring the network attention to this for a college of propaganda i be interest in jame webb young s madison avenue column in which he raise the question do we need a college of propaganda sr feb 11 in i estimation we definitely do and the sad part of it be that we have one which be round into excellent shape and we let it disintegrate and die during the war we set up school for the teach of psychological warfare which include the teach of propaganda both black and white and the various shade of grey in between we have a couple of school in this country the principal one be on the marshall field estate out in lloyd s neck there be also a couple in canada and several in england the english school precede ours and by the time we get into it they have learn a lot about the technique of propaganda and it teach four of we here in the unite state attend first a student then a instructor almost every one of these school in england canada and the unite state we set up the lloyd s neck school work out it curriculum and teach there toward the end of the war we really feel that we have learn something about propaganda and how to teach it when the end do come and the school be disband and abandon we feel and hope that the machinery of psychological warfare would not be allow to rust we hope that it practitioner and teacher might be put on some sort of reserve list and call back for refresher course each year or so alas no such thing happen there apparently be no school of propaganda or psychological warfare a study at the pentagon and at the service academy reveal that nothing be be do there and not one of the four man who attend all the school have ever be call on to apply any of he knowledge in any way congratulations on the article do we need a college of propaganda this be one of the most constructive suggestion make in this critical field in year and i certainly hope it spark some action let the media clean house too many of we in public relation be flatter that richard l tobin choose to devote he editorial in the march 11 communication supplement to the merger of the public relation society of america and the american public relation association snow storm i be surprise and sorry to find in you issue of march 4 a long and detail attack upon a book that have not yet be publish whether in he forthcoming book cp snow commit the error of judgment and of fact with which you heavily autobiographical critic charge he be important one should be able to get hold of the book at once but the attack be make from an advance copy if this practice should take root and spread the man who submit a manuscript to a publisher will find himself review before he be accept and publication will become a sort of post-mortem formality editor s note sir robert watson-watt write on page 50 of sr research for 4 march 1961 i have read an advance copy of the snow book which be to be title science and government until the work actually appear i be not privilege to analyze it publicly in detail but i have compare it text with already publish commentary on the 1960 series of godkin lecture at harvard from which the book be derive and i can with confidence challenge the gist of cp snow s incautious tale watson-watt s remark in sr do not then constitute a review of the book but a rebuttal to the godkin lecture representative of harvard university press which be publish the book this month of april recognize and freely acknowledge that they invite such reaction by allow life magazine to print an excerpt from the book in advance of the book s publication date the text of the book leave a somewhat mild impression than the prepublication excerpt sir robert watson-watt s rebuttal of sir charles snow s godkin lecture be mar throughout by too forceful a desire to defend lindemann and apparently himself from sir charles suppose falsehood while state those falsehood in an unclear incoherent argument the article present the reader with an absurdity at it begin it call the conclusion admit valid by historian and military strategist alike a pervert conclusion nonsense it submit an enthusiastic impressionistic conception of lindemann contribute another aspect of the man but on no more authoritative basis than sir charles account we be leave to choose between the two lindemanns the only fact that hold any weight in the article be the result of the tea party but we be to believe that lindemann actively support radar outside the tizard committee and dissemble discount it inside if so i would lean to sir charles conception of the man i think it be a grave error to print the article at this time to the unfortunate people unable to attend the godkin lecture it cast an unjustifiable aura of falsehood over the book which may dissuade some people from read it
