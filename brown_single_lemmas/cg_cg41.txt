if she be not at home mama would see to it that a fresh white rise be there sometimes mrs coolidge would close herself in the green suite on the second floor and play the piano she have bring to the white house mama know she be play she son s favorite piece and feel close to he and do not disturb she all the rest of the day in the white house would be shadow by the tragic loss even though the president try hard than ever to make he little dry joke and to tease the people around he a little boy come to give the president he personal condolence and the president give word that any little boy who want to see he be to be show in backstairs the maid cry a little over that and the stand invitation be not mention to mrs coolidge the president be even more generous with the first lady than he have be before the tragedy he would bring she box of candy and other present to coax a smile to she lip he bring she shawl dress be short in the day of mrs coolidge and spanish shawl be throw over they he get she dozens of they one shawl be so tremendous that she could not wear it so she drape it over the banister on the second floor and it hang over the stairway the president use to look at it with a ghost of a smile mrs coolidge spend more time in she bedroom among she doll collection she keep the doll on the lincoln bed at night when mama would turn back the cover she would have to take

be quiet than ever john be away at school most of the time mrs coolidge would knit and the president would sit read or play with the many pet around they now and then the president would call for little jack master of the hound which be he nickname for a messenger who have work in the white house since teddy roosevelt s administration and discuss the welfare of some one of the animal it be part of little jack s work to look after the dog one white house dog be immortalize in a painting that be rob roy who pose with mrs coolidge for the portrait by howard chandler christy to get he to pose mrs coolidge would feed he candy so he enjoy the portrait session a well a she do i would like to straighten out a misconception about the dress mrs coolidge be wear in this painting it be not the same dress a the one on she manikin in the smithsonian people think the dress in the picture be lengthen by an artist much late on this be not true the dress in the painting be a bright red with rhinestone form a spray on the right side there be a long train flow from the shoulder mrs coolidge give mama this dress for i and i wear it many time i still have the dress and i hope to give it to the smithsonian institution a a memento or a i more fondly hope to present it to a museum contain article show the daily life of the president if i can get it organize but to get back to the coolidge household mrs coolidge so obviously love dog that the public send she more dog calamity jane timmy and blackberry the last two be a red and a black chow rob roy remain boss of all the dog he show they what to do and teach they how to keep the maid around the white house in a state of terror the dog would run through the hall after he like a burst of bullet and all the maid would run for cover mama do nt know what to do whether to tell on rob roy or not since she have the ear of mrs coolidge more than the other maid but she be afraid the first lady would not understand because rob roy be a perfect angel with the first family every day when the president take he nap rob roy would stretch out on the window seat near he like a perfect gentleman and stare thoughtfully out the window or he would take a little nap himself he would not make a sound until the president have waken and leave for the office then he would bark to let everyone know the coast be clear he signal be for the other dog to come run but it be also the signal for mama and the other maid to watch out rob roy be self-appointed to accompany the president to he office every morning rob roy be well aware of the importance of this mission and he would walk in front of the president look neither to the right nor to the leave at dinner lunch or breakfast the president would call out supper he call all meal supper after the butler have announce the meal all the dog would dash to get on the elevator with the president and go to the dine room they would all lie around on the rug during the meal a very pretty sight a rob roy prudence and calamity jane be all snow-white when prudence and blackberry be too young to be trust in the dine room they be tie to the radiator with they leash and they would cry mama try to talk to they and keep they quiet while she tidy up the sit room before the first family return finally mama do mention to mrs coolidge that she feel sorry for the little dog and then mrs coolidge decide to leave the radio on for they while she be go even though she husband disapprove of the waste of electricity mama be now the first maid to mrs coolidge because catherine the previous first maid have become ill and die mrs coolidge choose mama in she place it be a high mark for mama every first family seem to have one couple upon whom it rely for true friendship for the coolidges it be mr and mrs frank w stearn of boston massachusetts owner of a large department store they seem to be at the white house half the time the butler be amuse because when the stearn be there the president would say grace at breakfast if the stearn be not there grace would be omit speak of breakfast the president inaugurate a new custom that of conduct business at the breakfast table the word be that this too be part of an economy move on he part a new bill have be pass under harding that designate the government rather than the president a the tab-lifter for official meal so the president would make a hearty breakfast official by invite government official to attend he cause a lot of talk when he also choose the breakfast hour to have the barber come in and trim he hair while he eat mama say that if president be suppose to be colorful mr coolidge certainly make a good president he know exactly how to be colorful the favorite guest of the house a far a the staff be concern be mr wrigley the chew gum king the white house have chew gum until it could chew no more and every christmas mr wrigley send the president a check for $ 100 to be divide among all the help you can
