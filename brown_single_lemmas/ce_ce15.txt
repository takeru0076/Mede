well-wedged clay free of air bubble and pliable enough to bend without crack clean wooden mold and press thoroughly they must be free of oil wax and dust press design the size of wooden mold will determine the amount of clay need roll clay to thickness indicate in individual instruction whenever possible use the wooden mold a a pattern for cut clay when mold have more than one design cavity make individual paper pattern place mold or paper pattern on roll clay and cut clay by hold knife in vertical position cut more piece than require for project to make allowance for defect experiment with defect for decoration technique of glaze and color place the cut clay piece loosely over the carve cavity design side of wooden mold to obtain clear impression of mold press clay gently but

piece of clay be sure to press the additional clay firmly into place without lock in air bubble allow project to stand for about five minute if wooden press mold be a good antique do not leave clay in too long a the dampness may cause mold to crack to release clay from mold place hand in a cup position around project gently lift the edge on far side then continue to release edge completely around mold slight tap on the underside of mold will help release the clay but too much agitation will cause the clay to become soft and will interfere with removal of clay from mold place a piece of plaster wall board or plaster bat on clay and reverse bat clay and mold in one action this will prevent the clay from twist or bend cause warp when fire place project on table and carefully lift the mold off study surface of clay for defect or desire correction if clay be slightly out of shape square straight side with guide stick or ruler press against opposite side or smooth round piece with damp finger if the background of design be too smooth or you wish to create a wood-grained effect it may be add at this time with a dull tool such a the handle of a fine paintbrush make slight smooth groove rather than cut for the texture cut could cause air pocket under the glaze create pinhole or crater in the glaze during fire leave the clay on plaster board to dry slowly cover lightly with a loose
