incarcerate in a furnace in the basement of the build in which he have live in new york he have dust each of the book carefully and carry they all to the basement and tremble at have to open the big

he to japan he pluck at the biwa try to make the sound he work resemble an ancient japanese tune he have once hear during he second week at sea he bring the curious melody out of the instrument and suddenly want to force the biwa to remain at just that moment in it history when it have give he pleasure he steal from he cabin late that night and creep out into a gusty north pacific wind and drop the biwa into the water it be so dark that he do nt see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean keep he from hear it it be a though the biwa have be eat up by the wind in tokyo richard take up a life similar to that which he have live in new york except that he have replace he biwa with a friend an american student name charlotte adam have refuse to take notice of he evident aversion to people and have at last succeed in get he to talk to she he have nothing much to say to she but that he say anything seem to please she and he accompany she on some of she unusually search tour of tokyo in charlotte richard see a frankness and a zest for do thing which after a fashion he envy in time he grow to depend upon she occasional company and she at length be able to encourage he to participate in more social activity she convince he that he ought to be a member of some of the small tea-drinking party she hold at she room and in the end he comply with she wish although it be only rarely that he add anything to the random conversation at one such gather charlotte announce i be at ryusenji today have you ever be to ryusenji no one have well it s at fudomae and there be a tan young man quite naked take a shower in the pool i be thoroughly startle richard think it a more promise remark than any make during the last conversation but charlotte s manner during the gathering be more flippant and superficial than when she be alone with he and he be sure she remark would lead to nothing much good than the pointless word which have precede it three of the four person present all foreign student in tokyo have be play a game of judge popular japanese food by the in and out system an equation in which zen philosophy be use a the modifier soba udon and tea be in because they could be take noisily sushi be out because it be pretentious sashimi be in samuel burn have suggest because it be too far out to stay out even if it be a little pretentious richard have keep he eye down throughout the game the very sound of the chatter nearly painful to he ear he be nt the least bit disturb by i watch he say charlotte do you watch he ask a red-haired girl name ceecee witter i should nt have be able to do that well i be able to do it charlotte say with no sign of irritation for a minute anyhow i m surprise no one have be there i ve be there a number of time sam i think you know everything about tokyo you ve never be to ryusenji i ve hear about it samuel burn say there s a little place there call lover mound dedicate to gompachi and komurasaki yes a little parkish place charlotte say and conclude anyhow it s all very nice and the man who bring sweet potato into kanto be bury there next to a beautiful seat statue of fudo oh that s what i mean to tell you this be the interest part richard she have a bothersome habit of try to pull he into the talk there be that fellow out there in the bitter cold i god it be cold today say samuel burn twenty-two or twenty-three and the water would be still cold ceecee seem to shiver at the think of it and you golden god say samuel burn probably go right home and pour himself into a boil bath it would kill one of we but the point be charlotte say there he be freeze naked in a little stream of water at ryusenji all in worship of fudo the god of fire richard s dark eye come up and seem for the tiny moment to reflect sharp light it be true fudo the god of wisdom be also think of a the japanese version of acala the conversation go on but richard stop listen he find himself try to remember something but he could nt decide even the nature of what it be he work to recall he have almost give up when he realize that the drop of he biwa into the icy jowl of the black pacific be the memory for which he have be search perhaps he sense some connection between the incident on the freighter and the ascetic at ryusenji he be unable to put it together that night after leave charlotte s apartment richard walk about for a time before return to he room when he at last do go to he room he could nt sleep and instead pace up and down before he little image of acala think first of charlotte s tale of the man at ryusenji then of he biwa and the invisible pacific water and the next morning not sure of why he go he take the train to fudomae and walk to ryusenji he be surprise by the sharp sensation he experience a he approach the pool which charlotte have mention he go through a gate to stand at the edge of the water and gaze at the two thin fall which drop from large spigot high at the back of the pool on the hillside above be cage what might have be an incarnation of fudo or perhaps a demon the strange creature house in wire make he shudder the sensation he so overwhelmingly realize be one which tell he he have be there before but he know he have not and could not recall any place he have visit to be liken to the limpid green water or the little fountain-falls or the green demon imprison beyond he reach he leave the pool and climb the steep stone stairs to the temple and the sense of familiarity with the place would not leave he into a little well before the temple he drop a hundred-yen coin and then he have an urge to sound the bell before the temple to take hold of the rope and crash it against the circle of bronze but the spirit he wish to call out would not he know come in the person of the temple priest instead he walk around the temple and mount still another flight of stairs and stand before the seat fudo at they head the black fudo seem to stare rigidly back at he and richard s eye be catch by the fudo s in fascination and then richard be shock a all at once flame shoot out from the sharp feature of fudo s face and there be a terrible metallic scrape sound a if the large statue be about to burst from some pressure within it then the flame be go the stillness fall upon the severe black face and richard begin to tremble violently suddenly he empty he pocket of all he coin and drop they into the box before the seat fudo and hurry back down both stairway and away from the temple never look back he walk all the mile back to he room he seem to have pick up a virus that day because the next morning he have a small cough and feel a bit hot he stay home read and refuse to think about he frighten experience at ryusenji but the process of refuse to think about it be an active reminder in itself and he could nt rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day the cold linger make sleep difficult that night and he remain in bed still the next morning now unable to keep from think about the inexplicable sight of burn metal the wretched sound the unbearable feel of have be to a remote tokyo temple at some early time in he life all of the element of the experience be impossible and yet the reality of they be heavy upon he and he resolve never again to visit the temple at fudomae
