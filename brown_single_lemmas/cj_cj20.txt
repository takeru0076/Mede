consider a simple close plane curve c which be a real-analytic image of the unit circle and which be give by afj these be real analytic periodic function with period t in the follow paper it be show that in a certain definite sense exactly an odd number of square can be inscribe in every such curve which do not contain an infinite number of inscribe square this theorem be similar to the theorem of kakutani that there exist a circumscribe cube around any close bound convex set in afj the latter theorem have be generalize by yamabe and yujobo and cairn to show that in afj there be family of such cube here for the case of square inscribe in plane curve we remove the restriction to convexity and give certain other result a square inscribe in a curve c mean a square with it four corner point on the curve though it may not lie entirely in the interior of c indeed the spiral afj with the two endpoint connect by a straight line possess only one inscribe square the square have one corner point on the straight line segment and do not lie entirely in the interior on c from the point p at afj to the point q at afj we construct the chord and upon the chord a a side erect a square in such a way that a s approach zero the square be inside c a s increase we consider the two free corner point of the square afj and afj adjacent to p and q respectively a s approach t the square will be outside c and therefore both afj and afj must cross c an odd number of time a s vary from zero to t the point may also touch c without cross suppose afj cross c when afj we now have certain square with three corner on c for any such square the middle corner of these will be call the vertex of the square and the corner not on the curve will be call the diagonal point of the square each point on c a a vertex may possess a finite number of correspond diagonal point by the above construction to each pair vertex and diagonal point there correspond a unique forward corner point ie the corner on c reach first by proceed along c from the vertex in the direction of increase t if the vertex be at afj and if the interior of c be on the leave a one move in the direction of increase t then every such corner can be find from the curve obtain by rotate c clockwise through 90-degrees about the vertex the set of intersection of afj the rotate curve with the original curve c consist of just the set of forward corner point on c correspond to the vertex at afj plus the vertex itself we note that two such curve c and afj can not coincide at more than a finite number of point otherwise be analytic they would coincide at all point which be impossible since they do not coincide near afj with each vertex we associate certain numerical value namely the set of positive difference in the parameter t between the vertex and it correspond forward corner point for the vertex at afj these value will be denote by afj the function f { t } define in this way be multi-valued we consider now the graph of the function f { t } on afj we will refer to the plane of c and afj a the c-plane and to the plane of the graph a the afj the graph a a set may have a finite number of component we will denote the value of f { t } on different component by afj each point with abscissa t on the graph represent an intersection between c and afj there be two type of such intersection depend essentially on whether the curve cross at the point of intersection an ordinary point will be any point of intersection a such that in every neighborhood of a in the c-plane afj meet both the interior and the exterior of c any other point of intersection between c and afj will be call a tangent point this terminology will also be apply to the correspond point in the afj we can now prove several lemma lemma 1 in some neighborhood in the f-plane of any ordinary point of the graph the function f be a single-valued continuous function proof we first show that the function be single-valued in some neighborhood with the vertex at afj in the c-plane we assume that afj be the parametric location on c of an ordinary intersection q between c and afj in the f-plane the coordinate of the correspond point be afj we know that in the c-plane both c and afj be analytic in the c-plane we construct a set of rectangular cartesian coordinate u v with the origin at q and such that both c and afj have finite slope at q near q both curve can be represent by analytic function of u in a neighborhood of q the difference between these function be also a single-valued analytic function of u furthermore one can find a neighborhood of q in which the difference function be monotone for since it be analytic it can have only a finite number of extrema in any interval now to find afj one need the intersection of c and afj near q but afj be just the curve afj translate without rotation through a small arc for afj be always obtain by rotate c through exactly 90-degrees the arc be itself a segment of an analytic curve thus if e be sufficiently small there can be only one intersection of c and afj near q for if there be more than one intersection for every e then the difference between c and afj near q would not be a monotone function therefore afj be single-valued near q it be also see that afj since the change from afj to afj be accomplish by a continuous translation thus afj be also continuous at afj and in a neighborhood of afj which do not contain a tangent point we turn now to the set of tangent point on the graph this set must consist of isolate point and close interval the fact that there can not be any limit point of the set except in close interval follow from the argument use in lemma 1 namely that near any tangent point in the c-plane the curve c and afj be analytic and therefore the difference between they must be a monotone function in some neighborhood on either side of the tangent point this prevent the occurrence of an infinite sequence of isolate tangent point lemma 2 in some neighborhood of an isolate tangent point in the f-plane say afj the function afj be either double-valued or have no value define except at the tangent point itself where it be single-valued proof a tangent point q in the c-plane occur when c and afj be tangent to one another a continuous change in t through an amount e result in a translation along an analytic arc of the curve afj there be three possibility a afj remain tangent to c a it be translate b afj move away from c and do not intersect it at all for afj c afj cut across c and there be two ordinary intersection for every t in afj the first possibility result in a close interval of tangent point in the f-plane the end point of which fall into category b or c in the second category the function afj have no value define in a neighborhood afj in the third category the function be double-valued in this interval the same remark apply to an interval on the other side of afj again the analyticity of the two curve guarantee that such interval exist in the neighborhood of an end point of an interval of tangent point in the f-plane the function be two-valued or no-valued on one side and be a single-valued function consist entirely of tangent point on the other side with the above result we can make the follow remark about the graph of f first for any value of t for which all value of f { t } be ordinary point the number of value of f { t } must be odd for it be clear that the total number of ordinary intersection of c and afj must be even otherwise start in the interior of c afj could not finally return to the interior and the center of rotation at t be the argument of the function not a value therefore for any value of t the number of value of f { t } be equal to the finite number of tangent point correspond to the argument t plus an odd number definition the number of ordinary value of the function f { t } at t will be call it multiplicity at t lemma 3 the graph of f have at least one component whose support be the entire interval afj proof we suppose not then every component of the graph of f must be define over a bound sub-interval suppose afj be define in the sub-interval afj now afj and afj must both be tangent point on the t component in the f-plane otherwise by lemma 1 the component would extend beyond these point far we see by lemma 2 that the multiplicity of f can only change at a tangent point and at such a point can only change by an even integer thus the multiplicity of afj for a give t must be an even number this be true of all component which have such a bound support but this be a contradiction for we know that the multiplicity of f { t } be odd for every t we have show that the graph of f contain at least one component whose inverse be the entire interval { 0t } and whose multiplicity be odd there must be an odd number of such component which will be call complete component the remain incomplete component all have an even number of ordinary point at any argument and be define only on a proper sub-interval of afj we must now show that on some component of the graph there exist two point for which the correspond diagonal point in the c-plane be on opposite side of c we again consider a fix point p at afj and a variable point q at afj on c we erect a square with pq a a side and with free corner afj and afj adjacent to p and q respectively a s vary from zero to t the value of s for which afj and afj cross c will be denote by afj and afj respectively we have afj plus tangent point these s-values be just the ordinary value of afj lemma 4 the value afj be the ordinary value at afj of a multi-valued function g { t } which have component correspond to those of f { t } proof we first define a function b { t } a follow give the set of square such that each have three corner on c and vertex at t b { t } be the correspond set of positive parametric difference between t and the backward corner point the function f and b have exactly the same multiplicity at every argument t now with p fix at afj af-values occur when the corner afj cross c and be among the value of s such that afj the root of this equation be just the ordinate of the intersection of the graph of b with a straight line of unit slope through afj in the b-plane the plane of the graph of b we define these value a afj and define g { t } in the same way for each t thus we obtain g { t } by introduce an oblique g { t } -axis in the afj
