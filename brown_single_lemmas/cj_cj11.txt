many other probably nearly all snake at maturity be already more than half they final length laurence m klauber put length at maturity at two thirds the ultimate length for some rattlesnake and charles c carpenter s data on michigan garter and ribbon snake thamnophis show that the small gravid female be more than half a long a the big adult felix kopstein state that when the snake reach it maturity it have already reach about it maximal length but go on to cite the reticulate python a an exception with maximum length approximately three time that at maturity it be hard to understand how he conclude that most snake do not grow appreciably after attain maturity he be work with species of java so perhaps some tropical snake be unusual in this respect certain individual giant record late do fail to show a reasonable difference after maturity but it be impossible to know whether this be due to captive condition additional record of slow growth have be omit it be possible to make a few generalization about the six giant themselves there seem to be a rough correlation between the initial and ultimate length start with the small boa constrictor and end with the large anaconda data on the former be scanty but there can be little doubt that the latter be sometimes bear at a length great than that of any of the other thereby lend support to the belief that the anaconda do indeed attain the great length for four of the six the anaconda and the amethystine python can not be include for lack of data there be also a correlation between size at maturity and maximum length the boa constrictor be the small and the indian python the next in size at the former stage let we speculate a little on the maximum size of the anaconda if in a certain part of the range it start life 1 foot long than do any of the other relatively large giant and reach maturity at let we guess 18 inch long than the other a quadruple of the maturity length would result in a maximum of nearly 40 foot when it come to rate of early growth the indian python lead with a figure of about 3 foot 6 inch per year for the first two year more or less the african rock python a close second be follow in turn by the reticulate python there be few data on the boa constrictor those for the anaconda be unconvincing and there be nothing at all on the amethystine python it seem likely that the indian python come out ahead because record of it growth have be make more carefully and frequently it respond exceptionally well to captivity and do not reach proportion that make it hard to keep i can not make sense out of the figure for post maturity growth at good the annual increase appear to be a matter of inch rather than foot until good record have be keep over long period of time and much more be know about the maximum dimension it will be wise to refrain from draw conclusion it be often state that the large snake require five year to attain maturity but this apparently be an overestimation the good way to determine the correct figure in captive be by direct observation of pair isolate from birth a method that produce surprise result mature of a male indian python in less than two year he mate in less than three data on the boa constrictor about match this another approach be to estimate from the rate of growth and the small size at maturity result from this approach amply confirm the direct observation about three year be require there be a possible slight difference between male and female in the time require only the amethystine python and the anaconda must be exclude for lack or paucity of data the follow information on snake vary greatly in size but all with less than a 10-foot maximum show when consider with the forego that there be probably no correlation between the length of a snake and the time require for it to mature oliver in he summary of the habit of the snake of the unite state could supply data on the mature period for only three species in addition to the rattler which i shall consider separately these three be much alike line snake tropidoclonion one year and nine month red-bellied snake storeria two year cottonmouth ancistrodon two year klauber investigate the rattlesnake carefully himself and also summarize what other have find he conclude that in the southern species which be rapidly grow type female mate at the age of two and a half and bear the first young when they be three other herpetologists have ascertain that in the northern unite state the prairie rattlesnake may not give first birth until it be four or even five year old and that the young may be bear every other year rather than annually carpenter s study show that female common garter and ribbon snake of michigan mature at about the age of two maximum length oversize monster be never bring home either alive or preserve and field measurement be obviously open to doubt because of the universal tendency to exaggerate dimension measurement of skin be of little value every snake hide be noticeably long than it carcass and intentional stretch present no difficulty to the unscrupulous explorer in spite of all the pitfall there be a certain amount of agreement on some of the giant the anaconda prove to be the fly in the ointment but the reason for this be not clear the relatively wild condition still find in tropical south america might be responsible there be three level on which to treat the subject the first be the strictly scientific which demand concrete proof and therefore may err on the conservative side by wait for evidence in the flesh this approach reject virtually all field measurement the next level attempt to weigh vary evidence and come to a balance sensible conclusion field measurement by experience explorer be not reject and even report of a less scientific nature be duly evaluate the third level lean on a belief that a lot of smoke mean some fire the argument against this last approach be comparable to that which reject story about hoop snake about snake that break themselves into many piece and join up again or even of ghost that chase people out of graveyard the mere pile up of testimony do not prove to the scientific mind the existence of hoop snake joint snake or ghost oliver have recently use the second-level approach with the large snake and have come to these conclusion the anaconda reach a length of at least 37 foot the reticulate python 33 the african rock python 25 the amethystine python at least 22 the indian python 20 and the boa constrictor 18-12 bernard heuvelmans also treat of the large snake but on the third level and be chiefly concern with the anaconda he reason that a anacondas 30 foot long be often find some might be 38 and occasional monstrous freak over 50 he reject dimension of 70 foot and more he thirteenth chapter include many exciting account of huge serpent with prodigious strength but these seem to be give to complete he picture not to be believe detail information on record length of the giant be give in the section that follow growth of the six giant discussion of the giant one by one will include a far a possible data on these aspect of growth size at which life be start and at which sexual maturity be reach time require to reach maturity rate of growth both before and after this crucial stage and maximum length with confirmation or amplification of oliver s figure definite information on the growth of senile individual be lack anaconda at birth this species vary considerably in size a brood of twenty-eight bear at brookfield zoo near chicago range in length from 22 to 33-12 inch and average 29 inch lawrence e griffin give measurement of nineteen young anacondas presumably member of a brood from south america the extreme measurement of these fall between the low limit of the brookfield brood and it average raymond l ditmars have two brood that average 27 inch rr mole and fw urich give approximately 20 inch a the average length of a brood of thirty from the region of the orinoco estuary william beebe report 26 inch and 24 ounce this snake must have be emaciate for the length and the weight of a young anaconda from british guiana in contrast ditmars record the average length of seventy-two young of a 19-foot female a 38 inch and four young be bear in london at a length of 35 or 36 inch and a weight of from 14 to 16 ounce beebe have a 3-foot anaconda that weigh only 98 ounce a difference between subspecies might explain the great range in size i have little information on the anaconda s rate of growth han schweizer have one that increase from 19-12 inch to 5 foot 3 inch in five year and jj quelch record a growth of from less than 4 foot to nearly 10 in about six year it be very unlikely that either of these anacondas be grow at a normal rate in 1948 afranio do amaral the note brazilian herpetologist write a technical paper on the giant snake he conclude that the anaconda s maximum length be 12 or 13 perhaps 14 meter which would approximate from 39 to 42 foot 14 meter be slightly less than 46 foot thus he estimate lie between oliver s suggestion of at least 37 foot and the 50-foot monstrous freak intimate by heuvelmans the most convince recent measurement of an anaconda be make in eastern colombia by roberto lamon a petroleum geologist of the richmond oil company and report in 1944 by emmett r dunn however a a field measurement it be open to question oliver s 37-12 foot be partly base on this report and can be accept a probable however many herpetologists remain skeptical and would prefer a tentative maximum of about 30 foot it be possible that especially large anacondas will prove to belong to subspecies limit to a small area in snake difference in size be a common characteristic of subspecies boa constrictor a colombian female s brood of sixteen boa constrictor bear in the staten island zoo average 20 inch this birth length seem to be typical when some thirteen record of newly and recently bear individual be collate little or no correlation between length and distribution can be detect the range be from 14 to 25 inch the former figure be base on a somewhat unusual birth of four by a central american female see chapter on lay brood hatch and birth the latter on a normal newly bear individual however a so many of the record be not certainly base on newborn snake these data must be take tentatively final conclusion will have to await the measurement of brood from definite locality alphonse r hoge s measurement of several very young specimen from brazil suggest that at birth the female be slightly large than the male i have surprisingly little information on the size and age at maturity carl kauffeld have write to i of sexual activity in february 1943 of young bear in march 1940 one female collect on an island off the coast of nicaragua be gravid and measure 4 foot 8 inch from snout to vent she tail should be between 6 and 7 inch long the female from central america which give birth to four be only 3 foot 11 inch long what data there be on growth indicate considerable variation in rate unfortunately no one have keep complete record of one individual whereas many have be make for a very short period of time the result be too vary to allow generalization
