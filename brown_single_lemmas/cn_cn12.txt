to ascertain that jess s buckskin be still miss and that he own gray be all right then climb through a back window and drop to the ground outside the fact that jess s horse have not be return to it stall could indicate that diane s information have be wrong but curt do nt interpret it this way a man like jess would want to have a ready mean of escape in case it be need probably he horse would be close to where he be hide from the back of the barn it be a simple matter to reach black s house without use the street curt approach the place cautiously and watch it several minute from the

scrape of a shoe hoof on a plank floor he move ahead carefully he leave hand in front of he and come to a wooden partition horse smell be very strong and he could hear the crunch of grain be ground between strong jaw he find a match in he pocket and light it there be two horse in the barn a sway-backed dun and jess crouch s buckskin curt snuff out the match it be certain now that jess be in the

and let he hand fall to he side he have find curt s weakness or what to jess be a weakness and be smart enough to take advantage of it somewhere in the distance a woman scream curt be too involve in he own problem to pay much attention he have to make jess talk and he have to do it before stacey black get curious and come to investigate once more he lift jess s gun from it holster only this time he toss it into the stall with the frighten buckskin he drop he own beside it we ll do it another way then he say harshly jess s coarse feature twist in a surprise grin which be smash out of shape by curt s fist with a roar of pain and fury jess make he attack curt manage to duck beneath the man s flail fist and drive home a solid leave to jess s mid-section it be like hit a sack of salt pain shoot up curt s arm clear to the shoulder but jess seem hardly aware that he have be hit he slam into the wall bounce back and catch curt with a roundhouse right which send he spin an inch low and it would have knock he out a it be he vision blur and for a moment he be unable to move when he eye begin to focus he see jess charge at he with a pitchfork curt twist to one side and the tine of the fork bit into the floor jess waste a few second try to yank they loose it give curt time to stagger to he foot the tine break off under jess s twist and he swing the handle in an attempt to knock curt

from the wall curt catch he flush on the nose with a blow which start at the floor jess have have enough blood gush from he nose and he back off a rapidly a he could stumble over he own foot in he
