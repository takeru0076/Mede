big burden there be lot of job available for train high school graduate but not for the dropout what we need be more vocational train in high school not more dropout two wrong to the editor of the inquirer i suppose i be miss some elementary point but i honestly can not see how two wrong can make a right i be refer to this country conduct atmosphere test of nuclear bomb just because russia be will we bomb be clean or will they fallout be less harmful to future generation of child if an atom bomb in 1945 could destroy an entire city surely the atomic arsenal we now have be more than adequate to fulfill any military objective require of it a i see it if war start and we survive the initial attack enough to be able to fight back the nuclear weapon we now have at least the bomb can inflict all the demage that be necessary why do we need big and good bomb i repeat two wrong do not make a right we tremble not to the editor of the inquirer everyone should take time to read martin luther s hymn a mighty fortress be we god especially the first half of the third verse out of the race to the editor of the inquirer to we everlasting shame we lead the world in this nuclear arm race sixteen year ago when we drop the first bomb on hiroshima and nagasaki have lead the world in this mad race i pray that we may have the wisdom and courage to lead it out of the race be we to be the master of the atom or will the atom be we master and destroy we why trust jagan to the editor of the inquirer just because cheddi jagan new boss of british guiana be educate in the unite state be no reason to think he be nt a red we have quite a few home-grown specimen of we own if we go all gooey over this new castro until he prove he be nt we ve get rock in we head how many time must we get burn before we learn russia and un to the editor of the inquirer just to remind the communist that the bomb drop on japan be to end a war not start one the war could have continue many year with many thousands kill on both side intelligent people will admit that bomb and rocket of destruction be frighten whether they fall on japan london or pearl harbor that be why the unite nation be form so that intelligent man with good intention from all country could meet and solve problem without resort to war russia have show it intention by explode bomb in peace time to try to frighten the world why be nt the soviet expel from the un belated tribute to the editor of the inquirer while good late than never may have certain merit the posthumous award of the nobel prize for peace to the late dag hammarskjold strike i a less than a satisfactory expression of appreciation have it be bestow while the secretary general of the unite nation be live unquestionably he would have be greatly encourage in pursue a difficult and in many way thankless task accord to one report however mr hammarskjold be consider too controversial a figure to warrant bestowal of the covete honor last spring actually of course that label controversial apply only because he be carry out the mandate give he by the world organization he head rather than follow the dictate of the soviet union at khrushchev s door therefore can be place the primary blame but also at fault be those who permit themselves to be intimidate it be well for we to remember that a wreath on a coffin never can atone for flower withhold while they still can be enjoy a have happen so often in the past the ability to recognize true greatness have be inadequate and tardy people to people to the editor of the inquirer just a brief note of appreciation to vice president johnson and pakistani camel driver bashir ahmad for provide a first-class example of people to people good will if only this could be do more often with such heartening result many of the earth s big problem would shrink to the insignificances they really be p thank for you good coverage of ahmad s visit too expressway answer east river drive to the editor of the inquirer you continue editorial concern the schuylkill expressway be valuable however several pertinent consideration deserve recognition one of the problem associate with the expressway stem from the basic idea we shuffle a large percentage of the car across the river twice they start on the east side of the schuylkill have to cross over to the west to use the expressway and cross over again to the east at they destination bridge tunnel and ferry be the most common method of river crossing each one of these be by it nature a focal point or a point of natural congestion we should avoid these congestion point or put it another way keep car start and end on the east side of the river on the east side this can be accomplish by several logical step 1 widen the east river drive at least one lane 2 so widen it a to minimize the present curve and eliminate drainage problem 3 paint continuous lane stripe and install overhead directional light a on we bridge one additional lane would then be directional with the traffic burden and effectively increase the traffic carry capability of the east river drive by fifty percent 4 this could be accomplish without the tremendous expenditure necessitate by the schuylkill expressway and without destroy the natural beauty of the east river drive shadow over washington square to the editor of the inquirer i wish to advocate two drastic change in washington square 1 take away george washington s statue 2 replace it with the statue of one or another of the world s famous dictator there s no sense in be remind of time that be washington square seem not part of a free land it may remind one of russia china or east berlin but it can nt remind one of the freedom that washington and the continental soldier fight for the fairmount park commission will no doubt approve i two proposal because it be responsible for the change of ideological atmosphere in the square the matter may seem a small thing to some people i know but it s a very good start on the road to totalitarianism the commission have post sign in washington square say the feed of bird be prohibit in this square fairmount park commission do each tentacle of the octopus of city government reach out and lash at whatever it dislike or consider an annoyance if bird do nt belong in a square or park what do they be the most beautiful part of that little piece of nature the tree be they home but the commission do not share such sentiment the whole official city apparently have an intense hatred toward bird starling and blackbird be scare off by canon from city hall just a preliminary measure if any be leave presently we may expect to see sign specifically prohibit the feed of they too the city government be not unite in an all-out to-the-death drive to stamp out gang delinquent thug murderer rapist subversive indeed no let every policeman and park guard keep he eye on john and jane do lest one piece of bread be place undetected and one bird survive of course in this small way of force the people to watch a tiny and innocent and dependent creature die because we re afraid to feed they and afraid to protest and say how come what s you motive who want this deed do in this small way do the leader of a city or of a nation inure the mass to watch or even inflict torture and death upon even they fellow man one mean to help the bird occur to i let the chime that ring over washington square twice daily discontinue any piece of music but one let they offer on behalf of those creature whose melody have be the joy of mankind since time begin the hymn abide with i we will know and he will know to whom it be render what the bird would ask not push-up but stand-up to the editor of the inquirer there be a trend today to bemoan the fact that american be too soft unfortunately those who would remedy we softness seek to do so with calisthenics they be work on the wrong part of we anatomy it be not we body but we heart and head that have grow too soft ashamed of we wealth and power afraid of so-called world opinion and addict to peace we have allow we soft-heartedness to lead to soft-headed policy when we become firm enough to stand for those ideal which we know to be right when we become hard enough to refuse to aid nation which do not permit self-determination when we become strong enough to resist any more drift towards socialism in we own nation when we recognize that we enemy be communism not war and when we realize that concession to communist do not insure peace or freedom then and only then will we no long be soft america do nt need to push-up she need to stand up dispute stan column business scandal view to the editor the new column by maurice stan regard business scandal be fair and accurate in most respect and he solution to the problem have some merit however he state unequivocally the scandal in business be far less significant than the scandal in labor i must in fairness take issue with he premise primarily because the so-called scandal in labor union be very much connect with business scandal the area most prominently comment on during the mcclellan hearing have to do with sweetheart contract these arrangement would have be impossible if the business community be truly interest in the welfare of it employe a sweetheart arrangement can come about a often by employer do the corrupt a by unscrupulous labor leader demand tribute anyone familiar with the detail of the mcclellan hearing must at once realize that the sweetheart arrangement augment employer profit far more than they augment the earnings of the corruptible labor leader far it should be recall that some very definite step be take by congress to combat corruption in the labor movement by it passage of the landrum-griffin act
