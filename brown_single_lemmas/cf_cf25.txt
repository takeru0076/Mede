i interview with teen-agers confirm this portrait of the weaken of religious and ethnic bond jewish identity be often confuse with social and economic striving be jewish give you tremendous drive a boy remark it mean that you have to get ahead when i press for a purely religious definition i encounter the familiar blend of liberal piety interfaith good will and a small residue of ethnic loyalty i like the tradition a girl say i like to follow the holiday when they come along but you do nt have to worship in the traditional way you can communicate in you own way a i see it there s no real difference between be jewish catholic or protestant another teen-ager remark most jew do nt believe in god but they believe in people in help people still another boy assert to be a good jew be to do no wrong it s to be a good person when ask how this be different from be a good protestant the boy answer it s the same thing this accord with the study by maier and spinrad they discover that although 42 per cent of a sample of catholic student and 15 per cent of the protestant believe it important to live in accordance with the teaching of they religion only 8 per cent of the jewish student have this conviction the most important aim of the jewish student be a follow to make the world a good place to live in 30 per cent to get happiness for yourself 28 per cent and financial independence 21 per cent nevertheless most of the teen-agers i interview believe in maintain they jewish identity and even envision join a synagogue or temple however they be hostile to jewish orthodoxy profess to believe in judaism but in a moderate way one boy say querulously about orthodox jew it s the twentieth century and they do nt have to wear beard the reason offer for cling to the ancestral faith lack force and authority even in the teen-agers mind we be bring up that way be one statement which win general assent i want to show respect for i parent religion be the way in which a boy justify he inhabit a halfway house of judaism still another suggest that he would join a temple for social reason since i ll be live in a suburb intermarriage which be generally regard a a threat to jewish survival be regard not with horror or apprehension but with a kind of mild clinical disapproval most of the teen-agers i interview reject it on pragmatic ground when you marry you want to have thing in common a girl say and it s hard when you do nt marry someone with you own background a fourteen-year-old girl from the middle west observe wryly that in she community religion inconveniently interfere with religious activity at least with the peripheral activity that many middle class jew now regard a religious it appear that an orthodox girl in the community disrupt plan for an outing sponsor by one of the jewish service group because she would not travel on saturday and in addition require kosher food another girl from a relatively large midwestern city describe herself a the only orthodox girl in town this be no doubt inaccurate but it do convey how isolate she feel among the vast army of the nonobservant the old teen one of the significant thing about jewish culture in the old teen year be that it be largely college-oriented sixty-five per cent of the jewish teen-agers of college age attend institution of high learn this be substantially high than the figure for the american population at large 456 per cent for male and 292 per cent for female this may help explain a phenomenon describe by a small-town jewish boy in they first two year in high school jewish boy in this town make strenuous exertion to win position on the school team however in they junior and senior year they generally forego they athletic pursuit presumably in the interest of good academic achievement it be significant too that the old teen-agers i interview believe unlike the young one that jewish student tend to do good academically than they gentile counterpart the percentage of jewish girl who attend college be almost a high a that of boy the motivation for both sex to be sure be different the vocational motive be the dominant one for boy while jewish girl attend college for social reason and to become culturally develop one of the significant development in american-jewish life be that the cultural consumer be largely the woman it be they who read and make jewish best-seller and then persuade they husband to read they in upper teen jewish life the non-college group tend to have a sense of marginality people automatically assume that i m in college a nineteen-year-old machinist observe irritably however among the girl there be some morale-enhancing compensation for not go to college the jewish work girl almost invariably work in an office in contradistinction to gentile factory worker and buttress by a respectable income she be likely to dress good and live more expansively than the college student she be even prone to regard the college girl a immature the lower-middle class college student one of the reason for the high percentage of jewish teen-agers in college be that a great many urban { jew be enable to attend local college at modest cost this be particularly true in large center of jewish population like new york chicago and philadelphia what be noteworthy about this large group of teen-agers be that although they attitude hardly differentiate they from they gentile counterpart they actually lead they life in a vast self-enclosed jewish cosmos with relatively little contact with the non-jewish world perhaps the jewish student at brooklyn college constitute 85 per cent of those who attend the day session can serve a a paradigm of the urban lower-middle class jewish student there be to begin an important sex difference typically in a lower-middle class jewish family a son will be send to an out-of-town school if financial resource warrant it while the daughter will attend the local college there be two reason for this first the girl s education have a low priority than the son s second the attitude in jewish family be far more protective toward the daughter than toward the son most jewish mother be determine to exercise vigilance over the social and sexual life of they daughter by keep they home the consequence of this be that the girl at brooklyn college outnumber the boy and do somewhat good academically one can assume that some of the bright boy be out of town brooklyn college student have an ambivalent attitude toward they school on the one hand there be a sense of not have move beyond the ambiance of they high school this be particularly acute for those who attend midwood high school directly across the street from brooklyn college they have a sense of marginality at be deny that special badge of status the out-of-town school at the same time there be a good deal of self-congratulation at attend a good college they be even incline to exaggerate it not inconsiderable virtue and they express pleasure at the cozy in-group feel that the college generate it s people of you own kind a girl remark you do nt have to watch what you say of course i would like to go to an out-of-town school where there be all kind of people but i would want lot of jewish kid there for most brooklyn college student college be at once a perpetuation of they ethnic attachment and a break away from the cage of neighborhood and family brooklyn college be unequivocally jewish in tone and effort to detribalize the college by bring in unimpeachably midwestern type on the faculty have be unavailing however a grow intellectual sophistication and the new certitude impart by course in psychology and anthropology make the student increasingly critical of they somewhat provincial and overprotective parent and the rebellion of these third generation jew be not the traditional conflict of culture but rather a protest against a culture that they view a softly and insidiously envelop a long a i m home i ll never grow up a nineteen-year-old boy observe sadly they do nt like it if i do anything away from home it s so much trouble i do nt usually bother for girl the overprotection be far more pervasive parent will drive on friday night to pick up they daughter after a sorority or house plan meet a freshman girl s father not too long ago call a dean at brooklyn college and demand the low-down on a boy who be go out with he daughter the domestic tentacle even extend to the choice of a major field under pressure from parent the majority of brooklyn college girl major in education since that co-ordinate good with marriage plan limit graduate study requirement and convenient work hour this mean that a great many academically talent girl be discourage from pursue graduate work of a more demand nature a kind of double standard exist here for jewish boy and girl a it do in the realm of sex the break away from the prison house of brooklyn be gradual first the student train on he hapless parent the heavy artillery of he newly acquire psychological and sociological insight then with the new affluence there be actually a sally forth into the wide wide world beyond the precinct of new york it be significant that the catskills which use to be the summer playground for old teen-agers a kind of summer suburb of new york no long attract they in great number except for those who work } there a waiter bus boy or counselors in the day camp the great world beyond beckon but it should be point out that some of the new water place fire island nantucket westhampton long island for example tend to be homogeneously jewish although brooklyn college do not yet have a junior-year-abroad program a good number of student spend summer in europe in general however the timetable of travel lag considerably behind that of the student at harvard or smith and acculturation into the world at large be likely to occur for the brooklyn college student after college rather than during the four school year brooklyn college be marjorie morningstar territory a much a the bronx or central park west there be horde of nubile young woman there who prod by they impatient mother be determine to marry it be interest that although the percentage of marry student be not appreciably high at brooklyn than elsewhere about 30 per cent of the woman and 25 per cent of the man in the graduate class the anxiety of the unmarried have puff up the estimate almost everybody in the senior class be marry student say dogmatically and the school newspaper sell space to jubilant fraternity sorority and house in the house plan association that have good news to impart these announcement be in effect advertisement for themselves a thrive marriage mart there be box proclamation in the newspaper of watchings pinnings ringings engagement and marriage in a scrupulously grade hierarchy of felicity witt house happily announce the engagement of fran horowitz to erwin schwartz of fife house the brooklyn college student show some strike departure from prevail collegiate model the ivy league enjoy no easy dominion here and the boy be a likely to dress in rather foppish continental fashion or even in nondescript work class manner a they be in the restrain button-down ivy way the girl be prone to dress far more flamboyantly than they counterpart out of town and eye shadow mascara and elaborate bouffant hairdo despite the admonition of cautious guidance personnel be not unknown even in early morning class among the boy there be very little bravado about drink brooklyn college be distinctive for not have an official drink place the fort lauderdale encampment for drink be foreign to most brooklyn college boy
