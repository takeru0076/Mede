with capital largely squander there seem to they no other course to pursue the director sell directly to concessionaire who have to make they profit above the high price ask by the company these concessionaire trade where they wish and generally deal with the indian through engage who might be habitants voyageurs or even soldier the concessionaire also have to pay a tax of one-tenth on the goods they trade and all pelt be to be take to company store and ship to france in company ship the company dispose of the pelt but with what profit the record do not show in accord with it penurious policy the company fail to furnish present to hold the loyalty of the principal indian the lavish use of present have be effective in expand the indian trade of new france and louisiana in the previous century and the change in liberality arouse resentment in the mind of the red man trader from the english colony be far more generous and indian loyalty turn to they protest from governor and intendant pass unheeded and the parsimonious policy of the company probably let loose indian insurrection that bring ruin to the company in 1721 the king send three commissioner to louisiana with full power to do all that be necessary to protect the colony they order the raise of troop and obtain 75000 livre with which to build fort they adopt a program by which louisiana be divide into five district in each of these there be to be a strong military post and a trade depot to supply the small trade house for southeastern louisiana mobile be the principal post and it be to furnish supply for trade to the north and east in the region threaten by british trader mobile be to be the anchor of a chain of post extend northward to the source of the tennessee river fort toulouse on the alabama river have be erect in 1714 for trade with the alabamas and choctaws but money be available for only one other new post near the present nashville tennessee and this be soon abandon west of the mobile district be the low mississippi district of which new orleans be headquarters dependent upon it be post on the low mississippi and the region westward to the frontier of new spain on the middle mississippi a principal post be to be locate near the mouth of the arkansas it be hope that to this post would flow a large quantity of fur from the west principally down the arkansas river on the ohio or wabash be to be build another post at the fork of two great river other post would be establish up the ohio and wabash to protect communication with canada on the upper mississippi the illinois post be to be establish near kaskaskia and dependent post be to be build on the missouri where there be mine in abundance each of the five principal post be to have a director responsible to a director-general at new orleans an elaborate system of account and report be work out and the trade be to be manage in the most scientific way concessionaire be to be under the supervision of the director engage must be loyal to the concessionaire and must serve until the term provide in the engagement be end the habitants be to be encourage to trade and be to dispose of they pelt to the concessionaire only two principal storehouse be actually establish one at mobile the other at new orleans new orleans supply the goods for the trade on the mississippi and west of that river and on the ohio and wabash mobile be also supply by new orleans with goods for the mobile district the power that bienville exercise during he first administration can not be determine regulation for the indian trade be make by the conseil superieure de la louisiane and bienville apparently do not have control of that body the conseil even treat the serious matter of british aggression a it business and on it own authority send to disaffected savage merchandise suitable for the peltry trade it decide also that the purely secular effort of bienville be insufficient and send missionary to win the savage from the heathen carolinians during the first administration of bienville the peltry trade of the mobile district be a lucrative source of revenue the alabamas bring in annually 15000 to 20000 deerskins and the choctaws and chickasaws bring the total up to 50000 pelt these deerskins be the raw material for the manufacture of leather and be the only article which the tribe of this district have to exchange for european goods during he first administration bienville succeed in keep carolina trader out of the alabama country and the choctaw country the director of the post at mobile keep an adequate amount of french goods of a kind to which they be accustom to supply the indian need the alabama and tombigbee river furnish a highway by which goods could be move quickly and cheaply de la laude commander of the alabama post have the friendship of the native and be able to make they look upon the british a poor competitor diron dartaguette the most prominent trader in the district be energetic and resourceful but he method often arouse the ire of the french governor he become after a time commander of a post on the alabama river but he operation extend from mobile throughout the district and he finally obtain a monopoly of the indian trade the chickasaws be the principal source of trouble in the mobile district they territory lie to the north near the source of the alabama the tombigbee the tennessee and cumberland river and be easily accessible to trader among the near-by cherokee in 1720 some chickasaws massacr the french trader among they and do not make peace for four year venturesome trader however continue to come to they from mobile and to obtain a considerable number of pelt for the french market british trader from south carolina incited the indian against the french and there develop french and british faction in the tribe the chickasaws finally be the occasion for the most disastrous war during the french control of louisiana to hold they be an essential part of french policy for they control the upper terminus of the route from the north to mobile they threaten constantly to give the british a hold on this region from whence they could move easily down the river to the french settlement near the gulf bienville realize that if the french be to hold the southeastern tribe against the enticement of british goods french trader must be able to offer a supply a abundant a the carolinians and at reasonable price he urging bring some result the company of the indies promise to send over a supply of indian trade goods and to price they more cheaply in term of deerskins but it couple with this a requirement that indian must bring they pelt to mobile and thus save all cost of transportation into and out of the indian country the insistence of bienville upon give liberal price to the indian in order to drive back the carolina trader be probably a factor that lead to he recall in 1724 for two year he friend and cousin boisbriant remain a act governor and could do little to stem the anglican advance although he incited a few friendly indian to pillage the invader and even kill some of they the carolina advance continue the company be impress with some idea of the danger from carolina and when perier come over a governor in 1727 he be give special instruction regard the trade of the mobile district but the company of the indies hold to it program of economy make no arrangement to furnish good goods at attractive price to the director the problem appear a matter of intrigue or diplomacy perier attempt to understand the problem by send agent to inquire among the indian these agent be to ascertain the difference between english and french goods and the price charge the indian they be to conciliate the unfriendly savage and wherever possible to incite the native to pillage the trader from carolina they be to promise fine present to the loyal red man a well a an abundant supply of trade goods at good price than the opposition be offer perier s intrigue gain some success the savage divide into two faction one be british and the other french so hostile do these faction become that among the choctaws civil war break out perier s effort however be on the whole ineffective in win back the tribe of the mobile district and he decide to send troop into the trouble country he ask the government for two hundred soldier who be to be specifically assign to arrest english trader and disloyal indian in spite of the company s restriction he plan to build new post in the territory he ask also for more supply to trade at a low price for the indian pelt no help come from the crown and perier in desperation give a monopoly of the indian trade in the district to dartaguette dartaguette go vigorously to work and give credit to many hunter but they bring back few pelt to pay they debt and soon french trade in the region be at an end perier finally in one last bid in 1730 cut the price of goods to an advance of 40 per cent above the cost in france the indian be not impress and hold to the carolina trader who swarm over the country almost to the mississippi with the loss of the mobile trade which end all profit from louisiana the natchez indian revolt they destroy a trade house and pillage the goods and harass french ship on the mississippi the war to subdue they tax the resource of the colony and pile up enormous debt in january 1731 the company ask the crown to relieve it of the government of the colony it state that it have lose 20000000 livre in it operation and apparently blame it poor success largely on the indian trade it offer to surrender it right to exclusive trade but ask an indemnity the king accept the surrender and fix the compensation of the company at 1450000 livre thenceforth the commerce of louisiana be free to all frenchman company rule in louisiana leave the colony without fortification arm munition or supply the difficulty of trade have ruine many voyageurs and number of they have go to live with the native and rear half-blood family other leave the country and there be no one familiar with the indian trade if this trade should be resume the habitants who have come to be farmer or artisan and soldier discharge from the army must be harden to the severe life of coureurs de bois this be a slow and difficult course and french trade suffer from the many mistake of the new group of trader these man be without capital or experience perier and salmon the intendant wish either to entrust the trade to an association of merchant or to have the crown furnish goods on credit to individual who would repay they debt with pelt bienville who return to succeed perier in 1732 object that the merchant would not accept the responsibility of manage a trade in which they could see no hope of profit he report too that among the habitants there be none of probity and ability sufficient to justify entrust they with the king s goods he do find some to trust however and he employ the king s soldier to trade with no company to interfere he keep close control over all the trader in order to compete with english trader bienville radically change the price schedule the king should expect no profit and an advance of only 20 per cent above the cost in france which would cover the expense of transportation and handle be all he charge the trader
