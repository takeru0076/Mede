for this change be not a change from one positive position to another but a change from order and truth to disorder and negation the liberal-conservative division we might observe in pass be not of itself directly involve in a private interest conflict nor even in struggle between rule group rather it be root in a difference of response to the threat of social disintegration the division be not between those who wish to preserve what they have and those who want change rather it be a division establish by two absolutely different way of think with regard to man s life in society these way be absolutely irreconcilable because they offer two different recipe for man s redemption from chaos the civilizational crisis the third type of change raise the question what be we to do on the most primitive level for the answer can not be derive from any socially cohesive element in the disrupt community there be no socially existential answer to the question for the truth formerly experience by the community no long have existential status in the community nor do any answer elaborate by philosopher or theoriticians in this phase of change no idea have social acceptance and so none have ontological status in the community an interregnum ensue in which not man but idea compete for existence if we examine the three type of change from the point of view of they internal structure we find an additional profound difference between the third and the first two one that account for the notable difference between the response they evoke the first two type of change occur within the inward and immanent structure of the society the first involve a simple shift of interest in the society the second involve something deep but it characteristic form focus on a shift in policy for the community not in the truth on which the community rest thus in both type attention be focus on the community itself and it phenomenological life the third type however wrench attention from the life of action and interest in the community and focus it on the ground of be on which the community depend for it existence voegelin have analyze this experience in the case of the stable healthy community there the community face with the need to formulate policy on the level of absolute justice can find the answer to it problem in the absolute truth which it hold a partially experience this however can not be do by a community whose very experience of truth be confuse and incoherent it have no absolute standard and consequently can not distinguish the absolute from the contingent it have lose it ground of be and float in a mist of appearance relativism and equality be it characteristic disease precisely at the moment when it have lose it vision the mind of the community turn out from itself in a search for the ontological standard whereby it can measure itself for paradigmatic history break rather than unfold precisely when the movement be from order to disorder and not from one order to a new order the liberal-conservative split to define it far derive from a basic difference concern the existential status of standard seek and about the spiritual experience that lead to it identification when disruptive change have penetrate to the third level of social order the process of disruption rapidly reach a point of no return indeed it be probable that this point be reach the moment the third level of change begin at that point we reach the close historical situation the situation in which man be no long free to return to a status quo ante at that point man become aware of the mystery of history call variously fate or destiny or providence and feel themselves catch helplessly in the writhing of a disrupt society the reason for this experience be root in the metaphysical characteristic of such a change of all form of be society or community have the great element of determinability it ontological status be itself most tenuous because apart from individual man who be it matter tradition the form of society exist only a a share perception of truth the ontological status of society thus be constitute by the psychological status of society s member the content of that psychological status determine ultimately the content of civilization those social civilizational factor not root in the human spirit of the group ultimately cease to exist civilization itself tradition fall out of existence when the human spirit itself become confuse civilization be what man have make of himself it massive contour be root in the simple need of man since he be always incomplete to complete himself it be not enough for man to be an ontological esse he need existential completion he need that be to move in the direction of completion and the direction of that movement be determine by he perception of the truth about himself he must consequently exist a a self-perceived substantive develop agent or he do not exist a man thus it be no mystical intuition but an analyzable conception to say that man and he tradition can fall out of existence this happen at the moment man lose the perception of moral substance in himself of a nature that in maritain s word be perceive a a locus of intelligible necessity an existentialist be a man who perceive himself only a esse a existence without substance thus human perception and human volition be the immanent cause of all social change and this most truly when the change reach the civilizational level thus with regard to the loss of tradition in the change from order to disorder the metaphysic of change work itself out a a disruption of the individual soul a change in which man continue a an objective ontological existent but no long a a man far change be a form of motion it occur a the act of a be in potency insofar a it be in potency and have not yet reach the terminus of the change with regard to the change we be examine the question be at what point do the change become irreversible a number of consideration suggest that this occur early in the process change involve the displacement of form this mean that the inception of change itself can begin only when the factor conducive to change have already become more powerful than those anchor the existent form in be if the existent form be to be retain new factor that reinforce it must be introduce into the situation in the case of social decay form be displace simply by the process of dissolution with no form at the terminus of the process now in the mere fact of the begin of such displacement we have prima-facie evidence of the ontological weakness of the fade form and when we consider the tenuous hold tradition have on existence any weaken of that hold constitute a crisis of existence the retention of a tradition confront with such a crisis necessitate the introduction of new spiritual force into the situation however the crisis occur precisely a a weaken of spiritual force it would seem therefore that in a civilizational crisis man can not save himself the emergence of the crisis itself would seem to constitute a warranty for the victory of disorder and it would seem that history be a witness to this truth a a far characterization of the liberal conservative split we may observe that it involve difference in the formula for escape inevitability in history these difference in turn derive from prior difference concern the friendly or hostile character of change unanalyzed response anxiety and deep insecurity be the characteristic response evoke by the crisis in tradition to experience they it be not necessary for a people to be actively aware of what be happen to it the process of erosion need only undermine the tradition and a series of consequence begin unfold within the individual while in institution a quiet but deep transformation of process occur within the individual the reaction have be call various name all however point to the same basic experience weil identify it a be rootless guardini a be placeless riesman a be lonely other call it alienation and mean by that no simple economic experience a marx do but a deep spiritual sense of dislocation within institution there be a mark decline of the process of persuasion and the substitution of a force-fear process which masquerade a the early one of persuasion we note the use of rhetoric a a weapon the manipulation of the mass by propaganda the mobilization of effort and resource within this context of spontaneous and unanalyzed response to the experience of civilizational crisis two basic organization of response be observable reaction and ideological progressivism these response be explicable in term of characteristic inherent in the crisis both be predictably destined to fail the response of reaction be dominate by a concern for what be vanish it essence lie in it attempt to recover previous order through the repression of disruptive force to this end political authority be call upon to exercise it negative and coercive power the implicit assumption of this response be that history be reversible seemingly order be perceive a a kind of subsistent entity now cover by adventitious accretion the problem be to remove the accretion and thereby uncover the order that be always there such a response of course miss the point that in crisis order be go out of existence moreover it posture of stubborn but simple resistance be doom to failure because of the metaphysical weakness of the existent form of order once the activation of change have reach visible proportion the most reaction can achieve be stasis and a stasis that can be maintain only by the expenditure of an effort which ultimately exhaust itself despite the hopelessness of the response it be explicable in term of the crisis of tradition itself since a civilizational crisis involve also a crisis in private interest and in the rule class reaction be normally find among those who feel themselves to be among the rule class they great error be to mingle the response typical of each of the three type of change since civilizational change be the most difficult to perceive and analyze it seldom be give adequate attention and the anxiety it generate be misinterpret a anxiety over private interest and threaten social status the basic truth in the reactionary response be to be find in it realistic assumption of the primacy of the real over the ideational but this truth be distort by it extreme application the assumption of the separate existence of tradition the reactionary miss the point that tradition exist ontologically only in the form of psychological-intellectual relation reactionary theory for this reason usually assume some form of organismic theory in it defensive formulation the theory will attack conscious change on the ground of the independent existence of the community in it dynamic form it visualize the community a the embodiment of an ontological force the race for instance which unfold in history in both case the individual tend to be treat a an instrument of the organic reality when the reactionary response be thus bolster by an intellectual defense the characteristic of that defense be explicable only in term of the basic attitude of unanalyzed reaction reaction be root in a perception of tradition a a whole it be a total situation that be defend the good old day there be no selectivity even the questionable feature of the past be defend the point be that the reactionary for whatever motive perceive himself to have be part or a partner of something that extend beyond himself something which consequently he be not able to accept or reject on the basis of subjective preference the reactionary be confuse about the existential status of a decay tradition but he do perceive the unity tradition have when it be healthy
