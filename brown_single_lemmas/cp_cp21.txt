cousin emma carraway have write it in she loose high old lady s script t s carefully cross but l s incline to wobble like an old car on the downward slope cousin emma have simply put miss theresa stubblefield rome italy on the envelope have walk up to the post office in tuxapoka alabama and mail it with a much confidence a if it have be a birthday card to she next-door neighbor no return address whatsoever somebody have scrawl american express piazza di spagna across the envelope and now theresa have it all a easily a if she have be the president of the republic or the pope inside be all the thing they think she ought to know concern the last illness death and burial of cousin alexander carraway cousin emma and cousin elec brother and sister unmarried devote age have live next door to the stubblefields in tuxapoka from time immemorial until the stubblefields have move to montgomery fifteen year ago two day before he be take sick cousin elec be out worry about what too much rain might do to he sweetpea and cousin elec have always preserve in the top drawer of he secretary a mother-of-pearl paper knife which theresa have covete a a child and which he have promise she could have when he die i m suppose to care a much now a then a much here a there she realize with a sigh this letter would have get to i if she have nt even put rome italy on it she refold the letter replace it in it envelope and turn with relief to one from she brother george but alas george when he have write have only just return from go to tuxapoka to cousin elec s funeral he be full of heavy family reminiscence all the fine old stock be die out look at the world today he own child have suffer from the weaken of those value which he and theresa have always take for grant and a for he grandchildren he have one so far still in diaper he shudder to think that the true mean of character might never dawn on they at all a life of gentility and principle such a cousin elec have live have to be know at first hand poor george the only boy the family darling together with she mother both of they tense with worry lest thing should somehow go wrong theresa have see he through the right college into the right fraternity and though pursue by various girl and various mamma of girl safely marry to the right sort however much in the early year of that match he wife anne have not seem to understand poor george could it just be theresa wonder that anne have understand only too well and that george all along be extraordinary only in the degree to which he be dull a for cousin alexander carraway the only thing theresa could remember at the moment about he except he paper knife be that he have have exceptionally long hand and foot and one night about one oclock in the morning the whole stubblefield family have be arouse to go next door at cousin emma s call first papa then mother then theresa and george there they all do they uttermost to help cousin elec get a cramp out of he foot he have hobble downstairs into the parlor in he agony and be sit wrap in he bathrobe on a footstool he hold he long clench foot in both hand and this and he contort face he be try heroically not to cry out make he look like a large skinny old monkey they all surround he the family circle theresa and george a solemn a if they be watch the cat have kitten and cousin emma run back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she pour steam into a white enamel pan can you think of anything to do she keep repeat i hate to call the doctor but if this keep up i ll just have to can you think of anything to do you might treat it like the hiccup say papa drop a cold key down he back i just hope this happen to you someday say cousin elec who be not at he good poor cousin elec george say he be young than theresa she remember look down and see he great round eye while at the same time she be dimly aware that she mother and father be not unamused poor cousin elec now here they both be still the same george full of round-eyed woe and cousin emma in despair theresa shift to a new page of course george s letter continue there be practical problem to be consider cousin emma be alone in that big old house and will nt hear to part from it robbie and beryl try they good to persuade she to come and stay with they and anne and i have tell she she s more than welcome here but i think she feel that she might be an imposition especially a long a we rosie be still in high school the other possibility be to make arrangement for she to let out one or two of the room to some teacher of good family or one of those solitary old lady that tuxapoka be populate with miss edna whittaker for example but there be more in this than meet the eye a new bathroom would certainly have to be put in the wallpaper in the back bedroom be literally crumble off theresa skip a page of detail about the house i hope if you have } any idea along these line you will write i about they i may settle on some makeshift arrangement for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the good i really should nt have smoke a cigarette so early in the day think theresa it always make i sick i ll start sneeze in a minute sit on these cold step she get up stand uncertainly for a moment then move aside to let go past she talk a group of young man they wear shoe with point toe odd to american eye and narrow trousers and they hair look unnaturally black and slick yet here they be obviously think to be handsome and feel themselves to be so just then a man approach she with a tray of cheap cameo parker fountain pen rosary papal portrait no say theresa no no she say the man do not wish to leave he know how to spread himself against the border of the space that have to separate they carrozza ride in the park the colosseum by moonlight he specialize theresa turn away to escape and climb to a high land where the step divide in two there she walk to the far leave and lean on a vacant section of banister while the vendor pick himself another well-dressed american lady carry a camera and a handsome alligator bag ascend the step alone be he ever successful theresa wonder the lady with the alligator bag register interest doubt then indignation at last alarm she cast about a though look for a policeman this really should nt be allow finally she scurry away up the step theresa stubblefield still hold the family letter in one hand realize that she whole trip to europe be view in family circle a an interlude between cousin elec s death and do something about cousin emma they be even anne and george probably think themselves very considerate in not hint that she really should cut out one or two country and come home in august to get cousin emma s house ready before the teacher come to tuxapoka in september of course it be nt anne and george s fault that one family crisis seem to follow another and be nt they always emphasize that they really do nt know what they would do without theresa the trouble be theresa think that while everything that happen there be suppose to matter supremely nothing here be suppose even to exist they would not care if all of europe be to sink into the ocean tomorrow it never register with they that i have time to read all of balzac dicken and stendhal while papa be die not to mention everything in the city library after mother s operation it would have be exactly the same to they if i have read through all twenty-six volume of elsie dinsmore she arrange the letter carefully one on top of the other then with a motion so suddenly violent that she amaze herself she tear they in two signora she become aware that two italian workman carry a large azalea pot be stand before she and want she to move so that they could begin arrange a new row of the display mi diapiace signora ma insomma oh put it there she indicate a spot a little distance away
