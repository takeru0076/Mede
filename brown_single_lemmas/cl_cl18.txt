 she say she have to finish a story he shrug i ask she why she could nt do it tomorrow but it seem the muse be work good tonight and she s afraid to let it go casey make some comment but he mind be busy a he consider the man he name be george needham and he too have come from a good family he be perhaps thirty-two nicely set up with light word hair that have a pronounce wave he be always well groom and well tailor and he have that rich man s look which be authentic enough and come from two good prep school and a proper university an only child he have do all the thing that young man do who have be bear to money and social position until he father double-cross he by die break since then he have work at this and that though some say he main interest be gamble all this go through casey s mind in the first instant but what hold he interest be the fact that these two should be together at all for he have understand that betty have be engage to a boy name barry jenkins she have grow up with young jenkins and he have hear that they have be at the point of get marry at least twice he want to ask she about jenkins now but he know he could nt do so in needham s presence and so still wonder and a little perplex he grin at the girl and speak lightly to make sure that she would know he be kid where do you pick he up oh i ve know he quite a while she glance at she companion fondly have nt i george i ve be after she for year needham say but i ve never be able to get anywhere until the last few day the girl s eye be softly shine a she reach out and touch casey s hand can i tell you a secret we re go to get marry do you approve casey keep he smile fix but some small inner disturbance be work on he a he think again about needham who be eight or ten year old than the girl he wonder whether needham be go to swear off gamble and get a steady job or whether he be count on the income from betty s estate to subsidize he none of this show in he face and he try to keep he skepticism in hand he make a point of frown of act out the part of the fond father-confessor i ll have to give it some think he say you would nt want i to say yes without make sure he intention be honorable would you she make a face at he and then she laugh of course not i ll get i reference in order needham say and though he speak with a smile casey somehow get the idea that he be not particularly amuse stop by any time casey he stand up and touch the girl s arm come on darling if you re really serious about work on that story i d good take you home casey watch they go still frown absently and then dismiss the matter a he call for he check a he go out he tell freddie the dinner be perfect and when he get he hat and coat from nancy park and put a fifty-cent piece in the slot he tell she to be sure that it go toward she dowry a taxi take he back to the bar and grill where he have leave he car and a few minute late he find a park place across the street from he apartment because he mind have be otherwise occupy for the past couple of hour he do not think to look and see if jerry burton s car be still there in fact he do not think about jerry burton at all until he enter he live room and close the door behind he only then when he glance focus on the divan and see that it be empty do he remember he early problem even from where he stand he could see the neatly fold blanket that he have spread over burton the pillow the sheet of paper on top of it then he be stride across the room he thought confuse but the worry build swiftly inside he a he snatch up the note jack look in the wastebasket i know the only way i could beat you be to play possum but it be a good try kid and i appreciate it the wastebasket stand near the wall next to the divan and the instant casey pick it up he know what have happen the discard paper inside be sodden there be a glint of liquid at the bottom and the smell of whisky be strong and distinct he put the basket down distastefully mutter softly and thoroughly disgust with himself and he plan that have seem so foolproof for he remember too well how he have bring back the load drink to burton and then return to the kitchen to get weak drink for himself for another second or two he give in to the annoyance that be direct at himself then he mind move on to be confront by something far more serious and a the think expand the implication jar he it no long matter that burton have outsmart he the important thing be that burton have go somewhere to meet a blackmailer with a gun in he pocket and that gun be empty even before he mind have round out the idea he thrust one hand into he trousers pocket and pull out the six slug he have take from the revolver he consider they with brood eye brow bunch a he brain grapple with the problem and try to find some solution he say the crazy fool half aloud he put the shell on the table a though he could no long bear to hold they he think where the hell could he have go how can i find he there be no answer to this and he begin to pace back and forth across the room he imagination out of control he try to tell himself that maybe burton have sober up enough to get some sense maybe he only intend to scare the blackmailer whoever he be in which case an unload gun would be good enough he think of other possibility none of they satisfactory and finally he begin to think to wonder if there be some way he could reach burton then a he turn toward the telephone it ring shrilly to shatter the stillness in the room and he reach for it eagerly yeah he say casey yeah tony calenda casey hear the voice distinctly and he know who it be but it take he a while to make the mental readjustment and control the disturbance inside he head when he hear calenda say what about that picture you take this afternoon it still take he another few second to remember the job he have do for frank ackerly what picture he demand you take a picture of i at the corner of washington and blake about three thirty this afternoon who say so one of i boy casey believe that much calenda be not the sort who walk around without one of he boy close at hand so with i trial come up in federal court next week i would nt want that picture publish who say it s go to be publish i would nt even want it to get around under normal circumstance casey be a little fussy when people tell he what to do with picture he have take even so he generally listen and be usually reasonable to those who voice they objection properly right now however he be still too worry about jerry burton and the gun that have no bullet and the story burton have tell he to care too much about tony calenda he nerve be get a little rag and he impatience put an edge in he voice look he say i be hire to take a picture i take it that s all i know about it and that s all i care maybe you d good tell the guy who hire you what i say you tell he all right calenda say he voice still quiet but i mean what i say casey if that picture get around and i find out you have anything to do with it i m go to send a couple of i boy around to see you you do that casey say just be sure to send you two good boy tony he hang up with a bang annoy at himself for run off at the mouth like that but still terribly concern with the situation he have help to create a soon a he could think logically again he reach for the telephone directory and find jerry burton s home number he dial it and listen to it ring ten time before he hang up he call the bar and grill where he have pick burton up that afternoon when he be tell that no one have see burton since then he think of three other place that be possibility each time he get the same answer and in the end he give up by the time he have smoke three cigarette he have calm down he have do all he could and that be that and anyway burton be not the kind of guy who would be likely to get in trouble even when he be drink he casey have be scare for a while but that have come mostly from the fact that he feel responsible he should have stay here and watch burton he do nt so he make a mistake so what he keep tell himself this a he go out to the kitchen to make a drink only then do he decide he do nt want one he consider open a can of beer but veto that idea too finally he go into the bedroom and sit down to take off he shoe he have just finish unlace the right one when the telephone ring again when he snatch it up the voice that come to he be quick and urgent casey you do nt know i but i know you if you want a picture get to the corner of adam and clark just a fast a you can if you hurry you might beat the headquarters boy casey hear the click of the distant receiver before he could open he mouth and it take he no more than three second to make he decision for over the year he have receive many such call some of they come from people who identify themselves some telephone because he have do they a favor in the past other because they expect some sort of reward for the information a few pass along a tip for the simple reason that they like he and want to give he a break only an occasional tip turn out to be a phony and like the police casey have make a point of run down all such suggestion and he do not hesitate this time he be in he car with he camera and equipment bag in less than two minute and it take he only three more to reach the corner a block from columbus avenue it be a district of small factory and loft building and occasional tenement and he could see the police radio car a he round the corner and slam on the brake he do not bother with he radio there would be time for that late but a he scramble out on the pavement he see the fill station and the public telephone booth and know instantly how he have be summon the police car have pull up behind a small sedan it headlight still on
