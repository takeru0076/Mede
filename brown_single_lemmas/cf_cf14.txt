everyone with a personal or group tragedy to relate have to be give he day in court a in some vast collective dirge for almost two month the defendant and the world hear from individual escape from the grave about father and mother graybeards adolescent baby starve beat to death strangle machine-gun gass burn one who have be a boy in auschwitz have to tell how child have be select by height for the gas chamber the gruesome humor of the nazi be not forget the gas chamber with a sign on it with the name of a jewish foundation and bear a copper star of david nor the gratuitous sadism of ss officer public relation strategist everywhere watch the reaction of the german press the liberal press the lunatic-fringe press listen to they neighbor study interview with man and woman on the street cry out too much too much the mind of the audience be become dull the horror be lose they effect and still another witness one who have crawl out from under a heap of corpse have to tell how the victim have be force to lie themselves head to foot one on top of the other before be shoot most of this testimony may have be legally admissible a bear on the corpus delicti of the total nazi crime but seem subject to question when not tie to the part in it of the defendant s department of jewish affair counsel for the defense however shrewdly allow himself to be sweep by the current of dreadful recollection rarely raise an objection would not the emotional catharsis eventually bring on by this awfulness have a calm if not exhaust effect likely to improve he client s chance those who fear emotionalism at the trial show less understand than dr servatius of the route by which man achieve the distance necessary for fairness toward enemy interruption come largely from the bench which numerous time rebuke the attorney general for let he witness run on though it too make no serious effort to choke off the flow but there be a contrast even more decisive than a hunger for fact between the trial in jerusalem and those in moscow and new york in each of the last the trial mark the begin of a new course in moscow the liquidation of the old bolshevik and the tighten of stalin s dictatorship in the unite state the initiation of militant anti-communism with the repentant ex-communist in the vanguard these trial be properly term political case in that the trial itself be a political act produce political consequence but what could the eichmann trial initiate of what new course could it mark the begin the eichmann case look to the past not to the future it be the conclusion of the first phase of a process of tragic recollection and of refine the recollection that will last a long a there be jew a such it be beyond politics and have no need of justification by a message it be not an individual that be in the dock at this historical trial say ben gurion and not the nazi regime alone but anti-semitism throughout history how could supply eichmann with a platform on which to maintain that one could collaborate in the murder of millions of jew without be an anti-semite contribute to a verdict against anti-semitism and if it be not an individual who be in the dock why be the trial a we shall observe late all but scuttle in the attempt to prove eichmann a fiend these question touch the root of confusion in the prosecution s case it might be contend of course that eichmann in stubbornly deny anti-semitic feeling be lie or insist on a private definition of anti-semitism but in either event he be the wrong man for the kind of case outline by ben gurion and set forth in the indictment in such a case the defendant should serve a a clear example and not have to be tie to the issue by argument one who could be link to anti-semitism only by overcome he objection be scarcely a good specimen of the jew-baiter throughout the age shout at eichmann though he might the prosecutor could not establish that the defendant be falsify the way he feel about jew or that what he do feel fall into the generally recognize category of anti-semitism yes he believe that the jew be enemy of the reich and such a belief be of course typical of patriotic anti-semite but he believe in the jew-as-enemy in a kind of abstract theological way like a member of a cult speculate on the nature of thing the real question be how one pass from anti-semitism of this sort to murder and the answer to this question be not to be find in anti-semitism itself in regard to eichmann it be to be find in the nazi outlook which contain a principle separate from and far bad than anti-semitism a principle by which the poison of anti-semitism itself be make more virulent perhaps under the guidance of this nazi principle one could a eichmann declare feel personally friendly toward the jew and still be they murderer not through fear of disobey order a eichmann keep try to explain but through a peculiar giddiness that begin in a half-acceptance of the vicious absurdity contain in the nazi interpretation of history and grow with each of hitler s victory into a permanent light-mindedness and sense of magical rightness that be able to respond to any proposal and the more outrageous the good well let s try it at any rate the substance of eichmann s testimony be that all he action flow from he membership in the party and the ss and though the prosecutor do he utmost to prove actual personal hatred of jew he success on this score be doubtful and the anti-semitic lesson weaken to that extent but if the trial do not expose the special nazi mania so deadly to jew a well a to anyone upon whom it happen to light neither do it warn very effectively against the ordinary anti-semitism of which the nazi make such effective use in germany and wherever else they could find it if anti-semitism be on trial in jerusalem why be it not identify and with enough emphasis to capture the notice of the world press in it connection with the activity of eichmann s department of jewish affair a exemplify by the betrayal and murder of jew by non-police and non-party anti-semite in germany a well a in poland czechoslovakia hungary the infamous wansee conference call by heydrich in january 1942 to organize the material and technical mean to put to death the eleven million jew spread throughout the nation of europe be attend by representative of major organ of the german state include the reich minister of the interior the state secretary in charge of the four year plan the reich minister of justice the under secretary of foreign affair the measure for annihilation propose and accept at the conference affect industry transportation civilian agency of government heydrich in open the conference follow the reason and even the phraseology of the order issue early by goer which authorize the final solution a a complement to previous solution for eliminate the jew from german live space through violence economic strangulation force emigration and evacuation in other word the promulgators of the murder plan make clear that physically exterminate the jew be but an extension of the anti-semitic measure already operate in every phase of german life and that the new conspiracy count on the general anti-semitism that have make those measure effective a a readiness for murder this in fact it turn out to be since the magnitude of the plan make secrecy impossible once the wheel have begin to turn person control german industry social institution and arm force become through they anti-semitism or they tolerance of it conscious accomplice of hitler s crime whether in the last degree or a lesser one be a matter to be determine individually what more could be ask for a trial intend to warn the world against anti-semitism than this opportunity to expose the exact link between the respectable anti-semite and the concentration-camp brute not in eichmann s anti-semitism but in the anti-semitism of the sober german man of affair lie the potential warn of the trial no doubt many of the citizen of the third reich have conceive they anti-semitism a an innocent dislike of jew a do other like they today the final solution prove that the jew-baiter of any variety expose himself a be implicate in the criminality and madness of other ought not an edify trial have make every effort to demonstrate this once and for all by show how representative type of mere anti-semite be draw step by step into the program of skull-bashings and gassings the prosecutor in he open remark do refer to the germ of anti-semitism among the german which hitler stimulate and transform but if there be evidence at the trial that aim over eichmann s head at he collaborator in the society where he function the press seem to have miss it nor do the trial devote much attention to expose the usefulness of anti-semitism to the nazi both in build they own power and in destroy that of rival organization and state certainly one of the good way of warn the world against anti-semitism be to demonstrate it working a a dangerous weapon eichmann himself be a model of how the myth of the enemy-jew can be use to transform the ordinary man of present-day society into a menace to all he neighbor do patriot everywhere know enough about how the persecution of the jew in germany and late in the occupy country contribute to terrorize the population split apart individual and group arouse the mean and most dishonest impulse pulverize trust and personal dignity and finally force people to follow they master into the abyss by make they partner in unspeakable crime the career of eichmann make the trial a potential showcase for anti-semitic demoralization fearful of be mistake for a jew he seek protection in he nazi uniform cling to the enemy-jew idea he be force to overcome habit of politeness and neighborliness once in power he begin to give vent to a criminal opportunism that cause he to alternate between megalomania and envy of those above he be this the type of citizen you desire the trial should have ask the nation but though this characterization in no way diminish eichmann s guilt the prosecutor more deeply involve in the tactic of a criminal case than a political one would have none of it finally if the mission of the trial be to convict anti-semitism how could it have fail to post before the world the contrast fate of the country in which the final solution be aid by native jew-haters ie germany poland hungary czechoslovakia and those in which it meet the obstacle of human solidarity denmark holland italy bulgaria france should not everyone have be awaken to it a an outstanding fact of we time that the nation poison by anti-semitism prove less fortunate in regard to they own freedom than those whose citizen save they jewish compatriot from the transport be nt this mean of eichmann s experience in various country worth highlight a the first collective confrontation of the nazi outrage the trial of eichmann represent a recovery of the jew from the shock of the death camp a recovery that take fifteen year and which be still by no mean complete though let no one believe that it could be hasten by silence only across a distance of time could the epic account begin it be already difficult to recall how little we know before the trial of what have be do to the jew of europe it be not that the fact of the persecution be unavailable most of the information elicit in jerusalem have be bring to the surface by the numerous war crime tribunal and investigate commission and by report memoir and survivor account
