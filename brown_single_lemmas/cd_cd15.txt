individual possess unusual gift and great personal power be transmute at death into awesome spirit they be almost immediately worship for these new even more terrible ability they direct descendant inherit not only they worldly fortune but also the mandate of they newfound power a spirit in the other half of the universe royal lineage could be base on extraordinary worldly achievement translate into eternal otherworldly power thus the emperor could draw on source not available to those with less puissant ancestor but this eminence be not without it weighty responsibility since he possess more power in an interdependent universe of live being and dead spirit the emperor have to use it for the benefit of the live the royal ritual generate power into the other world it also provide the live with a way to control the spirit and bring they power directly to bear on the everyday affair of the world proper ritual observance at any level of society be capable of generate power for use in the spirit world but naturally the royal ritual which provide unusual control over already supremely powerful divine spirit be hold responsible for regulate the universe and insure the welfare of the kingdom this be the familiar system of cosmic government the chinese emperor by proper observance of ritual manifest divine power he regulate the duality of light and darkness yang and yin which be lock in eternal struggle by sway the balance between they he effect the alternation of the season he power be so great that he even promote and demote god accord to whether they have give ear or be deaf to petition in this system no man be exempt from obligation failure in daily moral and ethical duty to one s family outrage to community propriety any departure from rigid standard of moral excellence be offense against the dead and to offend the dead mean to incur they wrath and thus provoke the unleash of countrywide disaster the family home be in fact a temple and the daily duty of individual be basically religious in nature the dead spirit occupy a prominent place in every hope and in every fear the common belief be that there exist one moral order which include everything the dead control the material prosperity of the live and the live adhere to strict code of conduct in order not to weaken that control man believe they could control nature by obey a moral code if the moral code be flout the proper balance of the universe would be upset and the disastrous result could be flood plague or famine modern westerner have difficulty comprehend this fusion of moral and material largely because in the west the historical trend have be to deny the connection live in urban condition away from the deadweight of village constraint and the constriction of a thatched-roof world view the individual may find it possible say to commit adultery not only without personal misgiving but also without suffer any adverse effect in he worldly fortune base action on the empirical determination of cause and effect provide a toughness and bravado that no powerful otherworldly ancestor could ever impart plus the add liberation from the constraint of silent burial urn in china the magical system par excellence be taoism the taoist be quietist mystic who see an unchanging unity the tao underlie all phenomenon it be this timeless unity that be all-important and not it temporary manifestation in the world of reality the taoist believe the unity could be influence by proper magical manipulation in other word they be actually an organization of magician mahayana buddhism be no exception to these prevail magical concept after this form of indian buddhism have be introduce into china it undergo extensive change during it flower in the sixth to the eighth century mahayana offer a supernatural package to the chinese which bear no resemblance to the highly digest philosophical zen morsel offer to the modern western reader mahayana have god and magic a pantheon heaven and hell and gorgeously appareled priest monk and nun all of whom wield power over soul in the other world the self-realized mahayana saint possess superhuman power and magic the mahayana that develop in the north be a religion of idolatry and coarse magic that make the world into a huge magical garden in it monastic form mahayana be merely an organization of magic-practicing monk bonzes who cater to the chinese faith in the supernatural nonmagical confucianism be a secular rational philosophy but even with this different orientation it could not escape from the ethos of a cosmic government confucianism have it own magic in the idea that virtue have power if a man live a classical life he need not fear the spirit for only lack of virtue give the spirit power over he but let we not be mistake about confucian virtue this be not virtue a we understand the word today and it do not mean an abandonment of the belief in magic manipulation to the confucian virtue simply mean mastery and correct observance of three hundred major rule of ritual and three thousand minor one propriety be synonymous with ritual observance the mark of a true gentleman to live correctly in an interdependent moral and material universe of live and dead be decisive for man s fate this in brief be the historical background out of which zen emerge promoter of zen to the west record it ancestry and recognize that zen grow out of a combination of taoism and indian mahayana buddhism but the marvelous person that be suppose to result from zen exhibit more chinese practicality than indian speculation he possess magical power and can use they to order nature and to redeem soul proponent of zen to the west emphasize disproportionately the amount of mahayana buddhism in zen probably in order to dignify the indisputably magical taoist idea with more respectable buddhist metaphysic but in the chinese mind there be little difference between the two the bonzes be no more metaphysical than a magician have to be actually zen owe more to chinese quietism than it do to mahayana buddhism the chan zen sect may have derive it metaphysic from mahayana but it psychology be pure early taoist this be well evidence by the quietist doctrine carry over in zen the idea of the inward turn of think the enjoinder to put aside desire and perturbation so that a return to purity peace and stillness a union with the infinite with the tao could be effect in fact the antipathy to outward ceremony hail by modern exponent a so uniquely characteristic of the direct think zennist be a feature of taoism so too be the insistence on the relativity of the external world and the idea that language and thing perceive by consciousness be poor substitute indeed for immediate perception by pure indwelling spirit the opposition of pure consciousness to ratiocinating consciousness zen maintain that cognitive thing be only the surface of experience one of it feature attractive to the west be it irreverence for tradition and dogma and for sacred text one patriarch be suppose to have relegate sacred scripture for use in an outhouse but this be not the spirit of self-reliant freedom of action for which the westerner mistake it it be simply that in taoist tradition a in all good mysticisms book word or any other manifestation that belong to the normal state of consciousness be consider only the surface of experience the truth the eternal truth be not transmittable by word reality be consider not only irrelevant to the acquisition of high knowledge but a positive handicap the technique of reality confusion the use of paradox and riddle to shake the mind s grip on reality originate with fourth and third century bc chinese quietism the koan be not basically a new device it be important for an understand of zen to realize that the esoteric preoccupation of the select few can not be the doctrine of the common man in the supernatural atmosphere of cosmic government only the rule elite be ever concern with a kingdom-wide order of nature popular religion aim at more personal benefit from magical power and this be only natural witness the haste with which modern man gobble the late wonder drug early chinese anchoritism be theoretically aim at a mystic pantheist union with the divine personal salvation be achieve when the mystical recluse unite with divine essence but this esoteric doctrine be lose in the shuffle to acquire special power the anchorite strive in fact to magically influence the world of spirit in the same way that the divine emperor manifest he power thus the mahayana metaphysic of mystical union for salvation be distil down to a bare self-seeking and for this reason the mystic in asia do not long remain in isolate contemplation a the zen literature reveal a soon a an early zen master attain fame in seclusion he be call out into the world to exercise he power the early anchorite master attract disciple because of they presume ability to perform miracle exponent of zen often insist that very early zen doctrine oppose the rampant supernaturalism of china and propose instead a more mature less credulous view of the universe in support of this story from the early literature be cite to show that zen attack the idea of supernatural power but actually these account reveal the supernatural power that the master be in fact suppose to possess a well a the extreme degree of popular credulity hwang pah o baku one day go up mount tien tai which be believe to have be inhabit by arhats with supernatural power meet with a monk whose eye emit strange light they go along the pass talk with each other for a short while until they come to a river roar with torrent there be no bridge the master have to stop at the shore but he companion cross the river walk on the water and beckon to hwang pah to follow he thereupon hwang pah say if i know thou art an arhat i would have double you up before thou get over there the monk then understand the spiritual attainment of hwang pah and praise he a a true mahayanist 1 a second tale show still more clearly the kind of power a truly spiritual monk could possess on one occasion yang shan kyo-zan see a strange monk fly through the air when that monk come down and approach he with a respectful salutation he ask where art thou from early this morning reply the other i set out from india why say the teacher art thou so late i stop respond the man several time to look at beautiful sceneries thou mayst have supernatural power exclaim yang shan yet thou must give back the spirit of buddha to i then the monk praise yang shan say i have come over to china in order to worship manjucri and meet unexpectedly with minor shakya and after give the master some palm leave he bring from india go back through the air 2 in the popular chinese mind chan zen be no exception to the idea of coarse magic that dominate a close look at modern zen reveal many magical carryovers that be still part of popular zen attitude to the zen monk the universe be still populate with spiritual being who have to be appease part of the mealtime ritual in the zendo consist in offering of rice to the spiritual being modern zen presentation to the west insist on the anti-authoritarian highly pragmatic nature of the zen belief scripture be burn to make fire action be base on direct self-confidence and so on this picture of extreme self-reliant individuation be difficult to reconcile with such zendo formula a o you demon and other spiritual being i now offer this to you and may this food fill up the ten quarter of the world and all the demon and other spiritual being be feed therewith 3
