it will be show that the objective of the cooperative people in an organization determine the type of network require because the type of network function accord to the characteristic of the message enumerate in table 1 great stress be place on the role that the monitor of information send play in maintain the effectiveness of the network by monitor we mean some system of control over the type of information send from the various center a a word of caution we should be aware that in actual practice no message be purely one of the four type question command statement or exclamation for example suppose a man wear a $ 200 watch drive a 1959 roll royce stop to ask a man on the sidewalk what time be it this sentence would have most of the characteristic of a question but it have some of the characteristic of a statement because the questioner have convey the fact that he have no faith in he own timepiece or the one attach to he car if the man on the sidewalk be surprise at this question it have serve a an exclamation also since the man question feel a strong compulsion to answer and thereby avoid the consequence of be think queer the question have assume some measurable property of a command however for convenience we will stick to the idea that information can be classify accord to table 1 on this basis certain extreme kind of network will be discuss for illustrative purpose network illustrate some special type of organization the cocktail party presumably a cocktail party be expect to fulfill the host s desire to get together a number of people who be inadequately acquaint and thereby arrange for bring the level of acquaintance up to adequacy for future cooperative endeavor the party be usually in a room small enough so that all guest be within sight and hear of one another the information be furnish by each of the guest be send by oral broadcast over the air wave and be receive by the ear since the air be a continuum the network of communication remain intact regardless of the position or motion of the point the people in the net a show in figure 1 there be a connection for communication between every pair of point this and other qualification make the cocktail party the most complete and most chaotic communication system ever dream up all four type of message list in table 1 be permit although decorum and cocktail tradition require hold the command to a minimum while exclamation have complimentary intonation be more than customarily encourage the completeness of the connection provide that for n people there be afj line of communication between the pair which can become a large number 1225 for a party of fifty guest look at the diagram we see that afj connection line come in to each member thus the cocktail party would appear to be the ideal system but there be one weakness in spite of the dream of the host for oneness in the group the afj income message for each guest overload he receive system beyond comprehension if n exceed about six the crowd consequently break up into temporary group range in size from two to six with a half-life for the cluster range from three to twenty minute for the occasion on which everyone already know everyone else and the host wish they to meet one or a few honore newcomer then the open house system be advantageous because the honore guest be fix connective point and the drift guest make and break connection at the door the rural community we consider a rural community a an assemblage of inhabit dwelling whose configuration be determine by the location and size of the arable land site necessary for family subsistence we assume for this illustration that the size of the land plot be so great that the distance between dwelling be great than the voice can carry and that most of the communication be between near neighbor only a show in figure 2 information beyond near neighbor be carry second - third - and fourth-hand a a distortable rumor in figure 2 the point in the network be designate by a letter accompany by a number the number indicate the number of near neighbor it will be note that point f have seven near neighbor h and e have six and p have only one while the remain point have intermediate number in any social system in which communication have an importance comparable with that of production and other human factor a point like f in figure 2 would other thing be equal be the dwelling place for the community leader while e and h would house the next most important citizen a point like p get information directly from n but all information beyond n be indirectly relay through n the dweller at p be last to hear about a new cure the slow to announce to he neighbor he urgent distress the one who go the far to trade and the one with the great difficulty of all in put over an idea or get people to join he in a cooperative effort since the hazard of poor communication be so great p can be justify a a habitable site only on the basis of unusual productivity such a be make available by a waterfall for mill purpose a i or a sugar maple camp location theorist have give these matter much consideration military organization the network for military communication be one of the good example of network which not only must be change with the change in objective but also must be change with the addition of new machine of war they also furnish proof that in modern war message send must be monitor without monitor a military hookup become a noisy party the need for monitor become great when radio be adopt for military signale alexander the great who use runner a message carrier do not have to worry about have every officer in he command hear what he say and have hundreds of they comment at once a time have pass and science have progress the speed of military vehicle have increase the range of missile have be extend the use of target-hunting nose on the projectile have be adopt and the range and breadth of message send have increase next to the old problem of the slowness of decision make network structure seem to be paramount and without monitor no network have value on the parade ground the net may be similar to that show in figure 3 the monitor be the high and most restrictive of any organization in existence no question statement or explanation be permit only command command go only from an officer to the man of near low rank the same command be repeat a many time a there be level in rank from general to corporal all order originate with the officer of high rank and terminate with action of the man in the rank even the officer in charge be it a captain for small display or a general be restrain by monitor this be do for simplicity of command and to bring the hide redundancy up to where misunderstanding have almost zero possibility the command be specify by the military regulation be few in number briefly word all different in sound and be combinable into sequence which permit any march maneuver that could be desire on a parade ground this monitor be necessary because on a parade ground everyone can hear too much and without monitor a confuse social event would develop with troop disperse on field of battle rather than on the parade ground it may seem that a certain amount of monitor be automatically enforce by the line of communication year ago this be true but with the replacement of wire or runner by radio and radar and perhaps television these restriction have disappear and now again too much be hear in contrast to cocktail party military organization even in the field be more formal in the extreme and oversimplify example suggest in figure 3 the organization be more easily understand and more predictable in behavior a military organization have an objective choose by the high command this objective be adhere to throughout the duration of the action the connective system or network be tailor to meet the requirement of the objective and it be therefore not surprise that a military body act a a single coordinate unit have a different communication network than a factory a college or a rural village the assumption upon which the example show in figure 3 be base be a one man can direct about six subordinate if the subordinate be choose carefully so that they do not need too much personal coach indoctrinate etc b a message run too great a risk of be distort if it be to be relay more than about six consecutive time c decision of a general kind be make by the central command and d all action of a physical kind pertinent to the mission be relegate to the line of man on the low rank these assumption lead to an organization with one man at the top six directly under he six under each of these and so on until there be six level of personnel the number of people act a one body by this scheme give a surprisingly large army of 55987 man this organizational network would be of no avail if there be no regulation pertain to the type of message send of type of message list in table 1 command and statement be the only one send through the vertical network show in figure 3 a far regulation be that command always go down unaccompanied by statement and statement always go up unaccompanied by command question and particularly exclamation be usually channele along informal horizontal line not indicate in figure 3 and seldom be carry beyond the near neighbor it will readily be see that in this suggest network not materially different from some of the network in vogue today great emphasis on monitor be imply than be usually put into practice furthermore the network in figure 3 be only the basic net through which other network pertain to logistics and the like be interlace not discuss here be some military problem of modern time such a undersea warfare where the surveillance send transmit and receive be all so inadequate that network and decision make be not the bottleneck such problem be of extreme interest a well a importance and be so much like fight in a rain forest or guerrilla warfare at night in tall grass that we might have to re-examine primitive conflict for what they could teach a team for useful research this be an unsolved problem which probably have never be seriously investigate although one frequently hear the comment that we have insufficient specialist of the kind who can compete with the german or swiss for example in precision machinery and mathematics or the finn in geochemistry we hear equally fervent concern over the belief that we have not enough generalist who can see the over-all picture and combine we national skill and knowledge for useful purpose this problem of the optimum balance in the relative number of generalist and specialist can be investigate on a communicative network basis since the difficulty of draw the net be great we will merely discuss it first we realize that a pure specialist do not exist but for practical purpose we have people who can be consider a such for example there be person who be in physical science in the field of mineralogy train in crystallography who use only x-ray apply only the powder technique of x-ray diffraction to clay mineral only and who have spend the last fifteen year concentrate on the montmorillonites or person in the social science in the field of anthropology study the lung capacity of seven andean indian so we see that a specialist be a man who know more and more about less and less a he develop a contrast to the generalist who know less and less about more and more
