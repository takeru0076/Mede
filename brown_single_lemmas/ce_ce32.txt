throughout history the man who show superior performance have become the commander of other for good or bad since the industrial revolution when factory emerge this classical pattern have be follow until recently there have always be tale of disillusionment the competent technician who become an administrator willingly or not and find he do nt like it the scientist who rebel against the personnel and paper work and much more commonly in recent year the engineer who find that other duty interfere with or eliminate he engineering contribution there have be many extremely competent man who have be convert into very incompetent manager or submerge in paper work to they own and the public s dissatisfaction and loss this have be more evident since we product have incorporate astronomically increase technology the remedy have be many and vary attempt to teach management technique either in plant at special school or in university crash course provision of management-trained assistant or associate but the realization have be grow that these be not the complete answer some man have no talent for or interest in management force they into management can only create trouble the old shop adage still hold a good mechanic be usually a bad boss yet we economy cling inexorably to recognition of managerial status a the gage of success labor fight to change it collar from blue to white all grade of management seek more resound title and income because of social pressure a several recent book have over-emphasize we have become the most status-conscious nation in the world what can be do for the individual contributor who be extremely important and likely to be more so in the operation of the technically orient company he be usually conscious of the social pressure at home and outside usually concern about america s belief that attainment and success be measure in dollar and title yet title be traditionally give only to management man and income tend to rise with title even the college professor in america have be affect it be a one engineer say indeed a difficult thing for the engineer to accept that he can go a far on he technical merit a he could employ managerial skill this difficulty arise even though we can give example of man who have actually follow this course this lead one to conclude a you have that there be inevitably more prestige in a management position in the mind of we people nobody should be more able to answer the question on this score than engineering vice-president and chief engineer so we ask such man in major company in the design field to offer they opinion on the dual-road-up problem and more importantly they solution in the paragraph that follow we quote from 32 man who be identify on the final page first what title what setup among the more familiar plan for dual-channel advancement be that of general electric this be not a mutually exclusive plan there be no one point in a man s career at which he must select either the technical or the managerial path upward far the management path do not open the door to high opportunity than be offer by the more technical path it be common to shift back and forth work up through a number of supervisory and individual-contributor position actually there be a number of individual-contributor position in both operate department and in the company-wide service operation that be fill by man with successful managerial experience who be currently broaden they capability also move into a managerial position do not necessarily end a man s recognition a a technical expert a example at ge glen b warren formerly manager of the turbine division widely recognize a a turbine designer the late w r g baker a pioneer in television design and long-time vp & gm of the electronics division and late by he own choice an individual consultant harold e strang expert in switchgear design for a long period vp & gm of the measurement & industrial product division and who currently approach retirement be vice-president and consult engineer in the switchgear & control division in the ge plan a number of individual contributor have position and compensation high than those of many manager these position carry such title a consultant advance development consult engineer consult engineer heat transfer consult electrical engineer senior electrical engineer senior physicist westinghouse have a similar system with two classification represent various level of competence on the strictly technical side consult engineer or scientist a the case may be and advisory engineer or scientist many company have system particularly in r & d which work more or less well depend upon size and actual belief in the policy on the part of administration a will be abundantly apparent in subsequent quotation another factor that may hold hope be for parallel recognition be a one man say it that the fad for educate top people along managerial line be yield to the technically train approach senior staff engineer one company institute early in 1959 a vertical classification system consist of four level there be no formal equivalence to the supervisory rank the top non-supervisory level senior staff engineer enjoy status and pay range up to that for the second level of engineering supervision the second level senior engineer rate slightly below first-level supervision the expectation be that first-level supervisor will be select in approximately equal number from the second and third engineering level with very few come from the first level the company expect to extend upward both compensation and status for non-supervisory engineer but probably not into executive level in this organization about half of the engineer with 15 or more year of employment be in supervision engineering or elsewhere this reflect the very heavy engineering content of the product which be not military several other example central and satellite we have over 20 division each of which have an engineering department head by a chief engineer we have set up a central r & d department a well a engineering-management department about 80 people work on problem relate to those of we plant a separate research department be of course confine to new or future design part of this headquarters staff however be engineering manager who work between divisional chief engineer and headquarters management these headquarters engineer head by the vice-president engineering counsel and advise divisional manager and chief engineer on product problem a well a aid with design and many be engineer who have be advance from the division these man be consider manager of engineer they must learn to wear several hat so to speak work with management sales and engineering problem relate to the product we do not have people in we organization term consultant or fellow who be specialist in one particular technical subject i suppose it be because we be just not big enough we have a few consultant retire engineer retain and call in on certain problem the only fellow in we company be those who have be honore by asme aiee or aiche i be sure that the engineer who enter management be nearly always open the door to great possibility than he would have a a technical specialist because of he wide accountability another structure we have try to make both path attractive so that good man could find opportunity and satisfaction in either one way to formalize this be in the job structure we have these position which compare directly afj above these job we have chief engineer for the company and vice-president of engrg r & afj the latter job include major management responsibility and have be fill by those who have come up primarily through the engineering-management side we have not yet succeed in establish recognition of technical specialization comparable to we high level of management but i believe we will trend in this direction but not to exceed vice-president top job research scientist approximately four year ago we initiate a dual ladder of advancement for technical person the high position be know a a research scientist this approach have not be entirely satisfactory the primary deterrent appear to lie with the technical people themselves and they concept of what constitute status in present-day society scientist who agitate hard for technical recognition be often the most reluctant to accept it we have discover that the outward trapping such a private office and private secretary be extremely important and although we have attempt to provide these status symbol support of the dual-ladder plan have be half-hearted despite the creation of a salary potential for a research scientist commensurate with that of man in top managerial position a serious problem accompany the technical-ladder approach be the difficulty of clearly define responsibility and standard of performance for each level with no set standard there be the tendency to promote to the next high level when the top of a salary band be reach regardless of performance promotion be too often base on longevity and time in salary grade instead of merit if no specific organization plan exist limit the number of scientist at each salary level the result be a department top-heavy with high-level high-salaried personnel staff engineer dept manager we have two approach for the technical man the position of staff engineer which be rate a high in salary a department manager and an administrative organization to take the routine load away from department manager and project engineer a much a possible thus allow they more time for strictly technical work these be only halfway measure and the answer will come when some way be find to allow the technical man in industry to progress without limit in salary and prestige a complete plan we have make limit application of the parallel ladder plan the high rate non-supervisory engineering title be research engineer the salary schedule permit remuneration great than the average pay to the first level of engineering supervision engineering section head we also have an engineering section head research engineer classification which have salary possibility equivalent to that of a research engineer above this point there be no generally use parallel ladder we also do a number of thing to build up the prestige of the engineer a a professional and also to give public recognition to individual technical competence these include encouragement of and assistance to the engineer in preparation and publication of technical paper we have two media for publicize individual technical activity a magazine widely distribute both within and without the company and an information bulletin for engineering personnel distribute to the home of all engineer publicity be give to the award of patent to we engineer and financial support be provide for individual membership in technical society a recent and more pertinent action have be the establishment of a technical staff report to the vice-president for engineering this function be staff by engineer choose for they technical competence and who have the title member of the technical staff salary compare favorably with those pay to the first two or three level of management additional symbol of status be grant such a reserve park distinctive badge pass authorize special privilege and a difference in the treatment of financial progress through merit we presently be involve in inaugurate a new development center operation of this nature offer the good opportunity to recognize scientific status all scientific staff member will have the title research-staff member the salary level of an individual within the group will reflect the scientific community s acceptance of he a an authority in he scientific field contrary to usual organization-position evaluation the position to which research-staff member report administratively will not necessarily encompass the duty of the research-staff member therefore be not necessarily evaluate a highly these recent step do not offer the possibility of extension to the great number of senior engineer who have display technical competence it be doubtful that the complete solution to the over-all problem can result entirely from company effort fundamental to the difficulty of create the desire prestige be the fact that in the business community prestige and status be confer in proportion to the authority that one man have over other and the extent of which he participate in the management function
