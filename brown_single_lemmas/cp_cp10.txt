among we we three handle quite a few small commission from spot drawing for advertise agency uptown to magazine work and quick lettering job each of we have he own specialty besides george do wonderful complicate pen-and-ink drawing like something out of a medieval miniature hundreds of delicate detail cram into an eight-by-ten sheet and look a if they have be do under a jeweler s glass he also draw precise crisp spot which he sell to various literary and artistic journal the new yorker for instance or esquire i do book jacket and cover for paperback reprint naked girl huddle in corner of dingy furnish room while at the doorway dare the cop to take he be the guy in shirt sleeve clutch a revolver the book could be the brother karamazov but it would still have the same jacket illustration i remember once i do a jacket for magpie press the book be a fine historical novel about edward 3 and i do a week of research to get the detail just right the fifteenth-century armor furnishing clothe i even ferrete out the material from which shield be make linden wood cover with leather so i d get the light reflection accurate mckenzie the art editor take one look at i finish sketch and say nothing do rufus in the first place it s static in the second place it do nt look authentic and in the third place it would cost a fortune to reproduce in the first place you ve get six color there include gold i say mr mckenzie it be a authentic a careful research can make it he say that may be but it be nt authentic the way reader think they know from they research into television and the movie that knight in the middle age have beautiful flow haircut like little lord fauntleroy and only the villain have beard and girl could nt have dress like that it be nt transparent enough in the end i do the same old picture the naked girl and the guy in the doorway only i put a lord byron shirt on the guy give he a sword instead of a pistol and paint in furniture from the still of a costume movie mckenzie be a happy a a clam that s authenticity he say a for donald he actually sell painting we all paint in we spare time and we have all start a easel painter with scholarship but he be the only one of we who make any regular money at it not much he sell perhaps three or four a year and usually all to joyce monmouth or she friend he have style a real inner vision of he very own it be strange stuff it remind i of the picture of a child but a child who have never play with other kid and have live all it life with adult there be the freshness of color the freedom of perception the lack of self-consciousness but with a twist that make the form leap from the page and smack you in the eye we use to kid he by say he only paint that way because he be so nearsighted it may have be true for all i know because he glass be like the bottom of milk bottle but it do nt prevent the painting from be exciting he also have at time an uncanny absent-minded air like a sleepwalker he would look right through you while you be talk to he and if you say for christ s sake donald you ve get prussian blue all over you shirt he would smile and nod and an hour late the paint would be all over he pants a well mrs monmouth think of he a she discovery and she pay two to three hundred dollar for a painting it be all gravy and donald do nt need much to live on none of we do we share the expense of the studio and we all live within walk distance of it in cheap lodgings of one kind or another attend the life class be i idea or rather askington s idea but i be ripe for it and the other two would nt have go if i have nt talk they into it i want to paint again i have nt do a serious picture in almost a year it be nt just the pressure of work although that be the excuse i often use even to myself it be the kind of work i be do the quality of the ambition it awake in i that keep i from painting i keep say if i could just build up a reputation for myself make some real money get to be well know a an illustrator like peter askington for instance then i could take some time off and paint askington be a kind of goal i set myself i have admire he long before i talk to he it look to i a though he have everything an artist could want joy in he work stand in the profession a large and steady income the night we first meet at one of mrs monmouth s giant party he be wear a brown cashmere jacket with silver button and a soft pink viyella shirt instead of a necktie he wear a leather bolo draw through a golden ring in which be set a lump of pale pure jade this set he tone richness of texture and color and another kind of richness a well for he clothing and decoration would have pay the brush-off s rent for a year he be fifteen year old than i forty-four but full of spring and sparkle he do nt look like what i think of a an old man and he lively and erudite speech make he seem even young he be one of the most prominent magazine illustrator in america you see one of he painting on the cover of one or another of the slick national magazine every month life have include he in it modern american artist series and have photograph he at he studio in the east sixties the corner of it you could see in the photograph look a though it ought to have velasquez in it painting the royalty of spain i have a long talk with he we go into mrs monmouth s library which have low bookshelves all along the wall and above they a modigliani portrait a jackson pollock twelve foot long and a gorgeous miro with a yellow background that look like an inscription from a martian tomb the fireplace have tile make for mrs monmouth by picasso himself like certain expensive restaurant just sit there give you the illusion of be wealthy yourself in the course of we talk askington mention that he spend part of each week study by yourself i ask no i take class with different people he say i do nt think i ve reach the point yet where i can say i know everything i ought to know about the craft besides it s important to the way a painter think that he should move in a certain atmosphere an atmosphere in which he may absorb the idea of other master a durer go to italy to meet bellini and mantegna he make a circle with he thumb and finger painting be nt this big you know it do nt embrace only the artist alone before he easel it be a large a all of art interdependent vary multitudinous he throw he arm wide he face shine the artist be like a fragment of a mosaic no he be more than that a virtuoso performer in some vast philharmonic one of these day i m go to organize a gigantic exhibition that will span everything that s be paint these day from extreme abstract expressionism to extreme photorealism and then you ll be able to see at a glance how much artist have in common with each other the eye be all inward or outward ah what a title for the exhibition the eye be all what do you study i ask i be fascinate just listen to he make i feel intelligent i m study anatomy with burn he reply maybe you know he he teach at the manhattan school of art i nod i have study with burn ten year before during the scholarship year the manhattan give i along with the five-hundred-dollar prize for i painting of bum on hudson street burn and i have not love each other i m also study enameling with hajime iijima he go on and twice a week i go to a life class teach by pendleton osric pendleton i say i god be he still alive he must be a million year old i go to a retrospective of he work when i be eighteen and i think he be a contemporary of cezanne s not quite askington laugh he s about sixty now still painting still a kind of modern impressionist beautiful canvas of mountain and farm he even make the city look like one of thoreau s hangout i ve always admire he and when i hear he be take a few pupil i go to he and join he class yes it sound great i say but suppose you do nt think of yourself a an impressionist painter you re miss the point he say he have the magical eye and he be a great man contact with he be stimulate and that s the trouble with so many artist today they lack stimulation they sit alone in they room and try to paint and only succeed in isolate themselves still far from life that s one of the reason art be become a useless occupation in the middle age in the renaissance right up to the early nineteenth century the painter be a giant in the world he be an artisan a man who study he trade and develop he craftsmanship the way a goldsmith or a wood carver do he fill a real need show society what it look like turn it inside out portray it war and it leader it ugliness and it beauty reflect it profound religious impulse he be a propagandist they be nt afraid of the word then satirist nature lover philosopher scientist what you will a member of every party and of no party but look at we today we hold safe little job illustrate tooth-paste ad or the salacious incident in trivial novel and most of we easel painting be nothing but pick the fluff out of the navel so it can be contemplate in great purity a bunch of amateur dervish what we need be to get back to the group to learn and apprenticeship to the cafe and the school he could certainly talk the upshot of the even be that i get the address of pendleton s studio or rather of the studio in which he give he class for he do nt work there himself and join the life class which meet every tuesday and thursday from ten to twelve in the morning it be an awkward hour but i do nt have to punch any time clock and it only mean that sometimes i have to stay a couple of hour late at the draw board to finish up a job after a short time both george and donald join the class with i so they would nt feel lonely and we use to hang a sign on the door of the brush-off read out to work it be mostly for the benefit of the mailman because hardly anybody else ever visit we in a way askington be right stimulate be the word for it i do nt know that it be always a reward a i have expect it to be partly it be because pendleton himself be nt what i anticipate i have come prepare to worship at the foot of this classic and he turn out to be a rather bitter old man who smell of dead cigar no that be nt quite fair actually there be a lot of force in he which be why i keep on in that class instead of quit after a week
