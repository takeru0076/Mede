surround by ancient elm the campus be spacious and beautiful the building be mostly georgian the dartmouth student do not live in monastic seclusion a he once do but he be still a simple life relatively free of the female presence or influence and he must go far even though he may go fast for sophisticate pleasure he be still heir to the rare gift of space and silence if he choose to be he be by no mean the country boy he might have be in the last century down from the hill with bear grease on he hair and a zeal for book learn in he heart the man s shop on hanover s main street compare favorably with those in princeton and new haven and the automobile that stream out of hanover each weekend toward smith and wellesley and mount holyoke be no less rakish than those leave cambridge or west philadelphia but there have always be an outdoor air to dartmouth the would-be sophisticate and the citybred youth adopt this air without embarrassment no one here poke fun at manly virtue and this give rise to an easy camaraderie probably unequaled elsewhere in the ivy league it even affect the faculty thus when dartmouth s winter carnival widely recognize a the great wild roaringest

bullet whose interest be self-evident and even sport a woodman s team which compete with other new england college in wood saw and chop canoe race and the like there be much to be say for a college that while happily attune to the sophisticate ivy still give it student a chance to get up early in the morning and drive along back road where a glimpse of small game deer or even bear be not uncommon city boy find a lot of learn in the feel of an ax handle or in the sharp tang of a sawmill come upon suddenly in a backwoods log camp and on the summit of mount washington where thirty-five degree below zero be commonplace and the wind velocity have register high than anywhere else in the world there be a kind of wisdom to be find that other man often seek in the himalayas because it be there there be much to be say for such a college and dartmouth man have be accuse of say it too often and too loudly they affection for they college home have even cause president dickey to comment on this place loyalty a something rather specially hanoverian probably a lawyer once say it good for all time in the supreme court of the unite state early in the nineteenth century the state of new hampshire be cast about for a way to find it own state university it fix on dartmouth college which be ready-made and just what the proctor order the legislator decide to liberate dartmouth and enter

hire by the college be argue specifically for dartmouth daniel webster class of 1801 make she plight the dramatic focus of he whole plea in an age of oratory he be the king of orator and both he himself and chief justice marshall be bathe in manly tear a uncle danl reach he thunder climax it be sir a i have say a small college and yet there be those who love it dartmouth be today still a small college and still a private one thank to webster s eloquence this be not out of keep with it origin probably the most humble of any in the ivy group eleazar wheelock a presbyterian minister found the school in 1769 name it after the second earl of dartmouth it sponsor and benefactor eleazar pause on the hanover plain find it great forest and remoteness good and with he own hand build the first college hall a log hut dedicate for the education & instruction of youth of the indian tribe in this land in read write & all part of learn which shall appear necessary and expedient for civilize & christianize child of pagan a well a in all liberal art and science and also of english youth and any other it be a hardy undertake and wheelock s be indeed a voice cry in the wilderness a road have to be hack through trackless forest between hanover and portsmouth to permit governor wentworth and a company of gentleman to attend the first dartmouth commencement in 1771 the governor and he retinue thoughtfully bring with they a glorious silver punchbowl which be still one of the cherish possession of the college the exuberance on this occasion set a standard for subsequent dartmouth gathering a student orator produce tear from a great number of the learn even before the punch be serve then from the branch of a near-by tree an indian underclassman disdain both the platform and the english language harangue the assemblage in he aboriginal tongue governor wentworth contribute an ox for a barbecue on the green beneath the three-hundred-foot pine and a barrel of rum be broach the cook get drink and president wheelock prove to be a man of broad talent by carve the ox himself future commencements be more decorous perhaps but the number of graduate increase from the original four at a relatively slow pace by the end of the nineteenth century in 1893 when the big three columbia and penn be populous center of learn dartmouth graduate only sixty-nine the dormitory include the beloved dartmouth hall could barely house two hundred student in spartan fashion then in 1893 dr william jewett tucker become president and the college s great awaken begin he transform dartmouth from a small new hampshire institution into a national college by 1907 the number of undergraduate have rise to 1107 and at he last commencement in that year dr tucker and dartmouth be honore by the presence of distinguish academic visitor attest to the new stature of the college the president of cornell wisconsin ccny bowdoin vermont brown columbia princeton yale and harvard and the president emeritus of harvard and michigan be there dartmouth be numerically still a small college today with approximately twenty-nine hundred undergraduate but it have achieve a cross-section of student from almost all the state and two-third of it undergraduate come from outside new england over 450 different school be usually represent in each enter class only a dozen or so school send a many a six student and there be seldom more than fifteen man in any single delegation about two-third of the boy now come from public school it be still a college only and not a university it be in fact the only college in the ivy group however three distinguish associate graduate school offer professional curriculum the dartmouth medical school third old in the country and found in 1797 the thayer school of engineering and the amo tuck school of business administration all three be purposely keep small with a current total enrollment of about two hundred all three school coordinate they educational program with that of the undergraduate college and like the college proper place emphasis upon a broad liberal art course a the proper foundation for specialize study student of the college who be candidate for the ab degree and can satisfy the academic requirement of the medical and business school may enter either of these associate school at the begin of senior year thus complete the two-year postgraduate course in one year the thayer school offer a year of postgraduate study in somewhat the same way after a boy win a bs in engineering so dartmouth be move close to the other in the ivy group it be still however the junior member of the league if not in year at least in the catch up it have have to do it have not be a well-known school for any part of the span the other ivy have enjoy however much football have be over-emphasize the public like to measure it collegiate favorite by the scoreboard so while yale need never give it record a think again since outscore it opponent 694 to 0 in the season of 1888 dartmouth have to wait until it championship team of 1925 for national recognition it have come on with a rush in more significant area today it espouse certain idea in it curriculum that other institution might consider somewhat breathtaking but dartmouth preserve it youthful brashness even in it educational attitude and although some of it experiment may still be in the test stage they make for lively copy president emeritus hopkins once propose to corral an aristocracy of brain in hanover
