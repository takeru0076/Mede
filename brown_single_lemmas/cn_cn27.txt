for several month now jack carter a big overgrow boy of fifteen with a fuzzy pimpled face and greenish catlike eye with a lot of red in they have be haunt by a dream a vision of a woman this woman have no distinct shape or size and no particular face but she radiate warmth a sweet warmth she would talk to he in a soothing voice about thing he mother would have say be not nice and put she hand on he and kiss he passionately when she would do these thing he would turn blind for an instant and become sick at he stomach then he would run to the toilet behind the house sometimes he do this three or four time a day for this woman be almost always with he he would feel ashamed each time and wonder whether he mother and father know think they might see it in he eye or smell it on he but they never say anything so he figure it be all right and so when miss langford come to teach at the one-room chestnut school where jack be a pupil in the eighth grade the woman of jack s mind assume the teacher s face and figure he could not keep he eye off she when at school when he go home at night he take she with he in he mind and she do the thing the anonymous woman use to do and he do the thing afterwards each time a he use to do when he awake in the morning she be in he mind and he could hardly wait to get to school to be near she in the flesh miss langford she first name be evelyn be an attractive girl tall blonde blue-eyes fair buxom without be heavy she cut a fine figure of bud womanhood a she swish among the pupil in she fresh starch summer dress something be begin to stir and come alive in she too it may have be there for a good while since she be twenty now but if it have be it have be smother until now by fear you could tell it by the way she watch the old big boy like

few day miss langford be very lenient with the child let they play a lot and the new one sort of get acquaint with one another the first two or three day they go home early all that be except jack he hang around the schoolhouse watch through a window from outside while miss langford straighten desk and put the room in order once this be on the third day of school she kneel down to pick up some book where they d drop on the floor and jack look up she dress at the bare expanse of incredibly white leg he think for a moment he heart have stop beat about that time miss langford straighten up and look out the window directly at he he think although probably she do nt even see he he jump back duck and run crouch down the hill away from the school he do nt look back and he run until he be out of sight of the schoolhouse and out of breath then he slow to a walk the vision become even strong now i ll get she yet he mutter to himself i ve get to get she that night he dream a dream violent with passion in which he and the woman now the teacher do everything except engage in the act and this probably only because he have never engage in the act in reality and when he awake the next morning he heart be afire he eat litle that morning and he mother become concern inasmuch a he usually eat heartily what s the matter honey she say with the solicitude of a middle-aged woman for she only child

dixie highway through a corn field and a patch of wood to the school jack know of course that the tale to be unfold would involve a girl and probably be dirty because girl be charles only apparent interest but jack always derive vicarious sensual thrill from charles revelation even when he suspect he friend of exaggeration or invention so he usually invite they a he do now no what i get margaret rider in one of they old box car down there by the quarry a nude imaginary picture of miss langford flash across jack s mind he heart beat fast hell you say he say lapse into the profanity he often use when away from he parent and especially when he be with charles how d you do it hell i jist get on top of no i mean how d you get she to do it hell i jist ask she jist like that hell yes she

of you back yard once in a while you might even get she you ownself i might try it one of these day jack say wonderingly think of miss langford when they reach the school a gang of boy and girl be already there play crack the whip in front of the schoolhouse miss langford in a fresh white dress and low-heeled white sandal without sock be out there with they try to get they inside time for book she yell jingle a little five-and-dime store bell in she right hand let s go inside oh come on miss langford play with we just onct one of the little girl beg smile wistfully no not now say the teacher maybe at dinner time come inside now the child grudgingly stop play then and straggle into the schoolhouse jack watch miss langford all morning he could think of nothing else save he mental image of she nude figure and what charles have say that morning about margaret rider occasionally he would look across the aisle at margaret fourteen and demure in a fresh green organdy dress sit in the sixth-grade row and he could hardly believe she would do what charles have say she do at noontime remember what the teacher have say about maybe play with the kid jack stay close to the schoolhouse while all the other big boy except charles go off out the road to play ball why ai nt you playin ball he ask charles suspiciously a they sit in the well-house shade watch the girl congregate in front of the schoolhouse miss langford come out and play with we like you promise several of the little girl call i d druther stay here and watch the girl charles grin maybe some of em will fall down and we ll see up they dress maybe jack say idly watch for miss langford presently she come out of the schoolhouse when she appear two or three of the little girl jump up and down yell goody goody let s play with em jack say rise from where he sit on the ground and dust off he overall pants ok charles rise also and the two of they move over to join the girl they play crack the whip a few minute without mishap then when miss langford be on the end of the line of girl jack in the middle of the line give an extra hard pull and the young teacher sprawl backwards sit down hard she dress fly over she head while she be struggle to get she skirt down and get on she foot again jack run over offer she he hand and say gosh i m sorry miss langford i do nt mean to pull so hard that s all right she say toss she head back to get the hair out of she eye it be i fault with one hand she hold she skirt down while she take jack s extend hand with the other when she hand touch he fire go

play with we again miss langford one of the little girl say no more today maybe some other day oh shucks the girl say i do nt believe i ll play any more neither i neither other say and soon the game break up the child go off in pair in large group and alone jack walk off alone out the road in the sear midday sun past robert allen s three-room tarpapered house toward the field where the other boy be play ball think of what he would do in order to make miss langford have he stay in after school because this be the day he have decide when he think he see the look in she eye when he come back to the schoolhouse he mind be make up he simply would not work he arithmetic problem when the teacher hold he class that should do it he think because miss langford have say she be go to be strict about school work he have consider throw eraser or flip paperwads at someone or pull the hair of the girl sit in front of he but he could nt take a chance on either of these possibility the teacher probably would make he stand face-to-wall in a corner instead of stay in after school the only drawback now to the plan he d decide on be that someone else might fail to do he work too and the teacher would have that person stay late along with jack but i ve get to take a chance on it he tell himself desperately to he surprise he plan work perfectly all right if you can nt do you arithmetic during school hour you can do it after school be out miss langford say firmly not smile you will stay here thirty minute after the other go home this afternoon and work you problem and so when the other stampede out that afternoon jack remain docilely in he seat near a window look out in what he hope be a pitiable manner while the other kid laugh and yell in at he and make face a they disperse go home he scarcely see they he heart be pound like a mighty dynamo and he be try to think he mind seem to scream at he like a hurt or frighten child how will i do it
