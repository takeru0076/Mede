have a number of rancher and cowboy witness ready and will to swear with straight face that he have be in bate hole the day of the kill the former scout s alibi could nt be shake the authority have to release he he immediately ride on to cheyenne throw a ten-day drink spree and drop some very strong hint among friend dead center at three hundred yard that coroner say he d grin three shot in that fella fore he hit the ground you reckon there s two man in this state can shoot like that publicly he deny everything privately he create and magnify an image of himself a a hire assassin for a blood-chilling ring of terror to the very sound of he name be the tool he need for the job he d promise to do tom horn be soon back at work give he secret employer they money s worth a good many beef-hungry settler be accept the death of william lewis a proof that the warn note be not idle threat the company herd be be raid less often and cabin and soddies all over the range be stand desert but there be other homesteaders who pass the lewis murder off a a personal grudge kill the work of one of he neighbor the rustle problem be by no mean solve even in the very area where the shoot have be do cattle be still disappear for less than a dozen mile from the unplowed land of the dead man live another settler who have ignore the warning that he existence might be foreclose on a blatant and defiant rustler name fred powell fred be mighty crude about the way he take in cattle he own hire man andy ross mention late everyone know it but he sort of act like he do nt care who know it even after they note come even after he d hear about lewis even after he d be shoot at a couple o time hisself on the morning of september 10 1895 powell and ross rise at dawn and begin they day s work haying time be close at hand and they need some strong branch to repair a hay rack harness a team to a buckboard they drive out to a willow-lined creek about a half-mile off then climb down and begin chop andy ross have just start swing an ax at he second willow when the distant blast of a rifle sound he look around in surprise then notice that fred powell be clutch he chest the hire man run over to help he boss i god i m shoot powell gasp and he collapse and die instantly ross have no intention of search for the assassin he heave the dead man onto the buckboard yell and lash at the team and get out of there fast but he bring back the sheriff and several deputy and to the lawman the entire affair seem a repetition of the lewis kill a detail scour of the entire area reveal nothing beyond a ledge of rock that might have be the rifleman s hide place there be no track of either hoof or boot not even an empty cartridge case could be find once again tom horn be the first and most likely suspect and he be bring in for question immediately once again he shake he head keep he face expressionless and he voice very calm and have a strongly support alibi ready late ride in for some lusty enjoyment of the liquor and professional lady of cheyenne he lay claim to the kill with the vague insinuation he make exterminatin cow thief be just a business proposition with i he d blandly announce and i sort o get a corner on the market tom a friend ask he once how come you bushwhack they rustler they would nt o stand no chance with you in a plain straight-out shoot-down he have lot of friend then a always even a he become widely know a a professional killer nearly every cowboy and rancher in wyoming seem proud to call he a friend no man s name bring more cheer when it be announce in a rodeo well he explain sposin you be a nester swingin the long rope which would you be most scairt of a dry-gulchin or a shoot-down yeah i can see that the friend be force to agree but well it just do nt seem sportin somehow sportin the tall sunburnt rustler-hunter stare in amazement sportin he echo again in soft wonder i see a lot o thing in i time i find a trooper once the apache have spread-eagled on an ant hill and another time we run across some teamsters they d catch tie upside down on they own wagon wheel over little fire until they brain be explode right out o they skull i hear o texas cattleman wrappin a cow thief up in green hide and lettin the sun shrink em and squeeze he to death but there s one thing i never see or hear of one thing i just do nt think there be and that s a sportin way o killin a man after the first two murder the warn note be rarely ignore the lesson have be learn the example be plain when fred powell s brother-in-law charlie keane move into the dead man s home the anonymous letter writer take no chance on charlie take up where fred have leave off and waste no time on a first notice if you do nt leave this country within 3 day you life will be take the same a powell s be this be the message find tack to the cabin door keane leave within three day all through albany and laramie county other man be do the same house of settler who d treat the company herd a a natural resource free for the take be sit empty with weed grow high in they yard the small half-heartedly tend field of man who d spend more time rustle cattle than farm be lie fallow no cow thief could count on a jury of he sympathetic peer to free he any long jury judge and executioner be ride the range in the form of a single unknown figure that could materialize anywhere at any time to dispense an ancient brand of justice the man of the new west have believe long outdated for three straight year tom horn patrol the southern wyoming pasture and how many man he kill after lewis and powell if he kill lewis and powell will never be know it be possible although highly doubtful that he kill none at all but merely let he reputation work for he by privately claim every unsolved murder in the state it be also possible but equally doubtful that he actually shoot down the hundreds of man with which he legend credit he for that legend be grow explosively rumor be insist he receive a price of $ 600 a man the good evidence be that he receive a monthly wage of about $ 125 very good money in an era when top hand work for $ 30 and find rumor have it he slip two small rock under each victim s head a a sort of trademark a detail search of old coroner s report fail to substantiate this in the slight one thing be certain he method be effective so effective that after a time even the warn notice be often unnecessary the mere fact that the tall figure with the rifle and field glass have be see ride that way be enough to frighten three rustle homesteaders out of the upper laramie country in a single week i reputation s i stock in trade tom mention more than once he evidently could nt foresee that it might be he downfall in the end he have make himself the personification of the devil to the homesteaders but to the cattleman who have be face bankruptcy from rustle loss and to the cowboy who have be face with lay-off a few year early he be become a vastly different type of legendary figure such rancher a coble and clay and the bosler brother carry he on they book a a cowhand even while he be receive a much large salary from party unknown he make they spread he headquarters and he help out in they roundup in the cow camp tom horn be regard a a hero a the same kind of champion he be when he enter and invariably win the local rodeo the hand and they boss see he a a lone knight of the range wage a dedicate crusade against a lawless new society that be threaten a beloved way of life the wail guitar-strumming minstrel of the cattle kingdom make up song about he by 1898 rustle loss have be drive down to the low level ever see in wyoming
