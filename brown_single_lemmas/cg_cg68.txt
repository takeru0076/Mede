christ s college be well represent that year in the ordo and the name high on the list from that college be milton s fourth in the entire university small wonder that milton late boast of how well he work have be receive there since he attain a rank in the order of commence bachelor high than that of any other inceptor from christ s of that year it be not possible to reconstruct fully the arrangement whereby these honor list be then make up or even how the name that they contain assume the order in which we find they the process usually begin with a tutor boast about a boy a chappell have boast about lightfoot to the high officer of the college and university then the various officer of the college might take up the case it would however reach the proctor and other officer in charge of the public-school performance of the incepting bachelor and the place that any individual obtain in the list depend greatly on how he comport himself in the public school during he act therein a he be incepting of course the high official could add or place a name on the list wherever they wish milton s name be fourth be neither too high nor too low to be assign to the arbitrary action of vice-chancellor proctor master or other mighty hand he evidently earn the place assign he recapitulation of milton s undergraduate career look back from the spring of 1629 over the four year of milton s undergraduate day certain phase of he college career stand out a of permanent consequence to he and hence to we of course the principal factor in the whole experience be the kind of education he receive it differ from what an undergraduate receive today from any american college or university mainly in the certainty of what he be force to learn compare with the loose and widely scatter information obtain today by most of we undergraduate milton be require to absorb and display an intensive and accurate knowledge of latin grammar logic-rhetoric ethics physics or natural philosophy metaphysic and latin greek and hebrew he have also sample various special field of learn be unable to miss some study of divinity justinian law and galen medicine above all he have learn to write formal latin prose and verse to a remarkable degree of artistry he have learn to dispute devastatingly both formally and informally in latin and accord to the rule on any topic pro or con draw from almost any subject more especially from aristotle s work he could produce carefully construct oration set and formal speech artfully and prayerfully make by write and rewriting with all the aid he tutor and other could provide and then deliver verbatim from memory he have also learn to dispute extempore remarkably well the main evidence for which of course be the presence of he name in the honor list of 162829 he also display the ability to write latin verse on almost any topic of dispute the verse of course to be deliver from memory then we have survive at least one instance of a poem prepare for another in naturam non pati senium and perhaps also the de idea platonica but he great achievement in he own eye and in the eye of he colleague and teacher be he amaze ability to produce literary latin piece and he be often call on to do so these be he public academic activity domi forisque in the college and in the university and he performance attract much attention a the frequency of he survive piece in any calendar that may be set up for he undergraduate activity testify he other activity be not so easily recover he statement about sport and exercise of a physical nature be suggestive but inconclusive he late boastings of he skill with the small sword be indicative of much time and practice devote to the use of that weapon venn and other have deal with sport and pastime at cambridge in milton s day with not very specific result milton himself uncommunicative a he be about he lesser and nonliterary activity at least give we some evidence that he be a great walker under any and all condition he early poem and some of he prose prolusions speak of wandering in the city and the neighboring country that may be extend to cambridge and it surround countryside the town itself and the reedy cam he often visit a do all in the university the church the tavern and the various other place of the town must have know he figure well a he rove to and about they the tiny hamlet of chesterton to the north with the fen and marsh lie on down the ouse river may have attract he often a it do many other youth of the time the gog magog hill to the southeast afford he and all other student a vantage point from which to view the town and university of they dwelling the country about cambridge be flat and not particularly spectacular in it scenery though it offer easy go to the foot traveler ball game especially football require some attention and other organize sport may have attract he a participant or spectator he smoke a do everybody and imbibe the various alcoholic beverage of that day although he protestation while at cambridge and after that he be no drunkard point to reasonable abstinence from the wild drink bout of some of the undergraduate and we must add of some of they elder include many of the regent or teacher what manner of person do milton appear to have be when a an undergraduate he reside at christ s college he be then a slightly build young man of please appearance medium stature and handsome face graceful a he fence and dance lesson have teach he to be in addition to the natural grace of he slight wiry frame he cut enough of a figure to have evoke a nickname in the college to which he himself refer in prolusion 6 a quibusdam audivi nuper domina that be if we can trust that most specious of prolusions pack a it be with wit and persiflage the domina sound real enough if we could only trust the condition under which we learn of it use but anyone who would put much trust in any phase of prolusion 6 except it illusive allusiveness deserve whatever fate may be mete out to he by virtue of the egregiously stilt banter in short the traditional epithet for milton of lady of christ s while eminently fit rest only on this baffle passage in the midst of the most treacherous piece of write milton leave we aubrey s mention of it 267 and bodleian ms aubr 8 f 63 come from this prolusion through christopher milton or edward phillips it be not a question of truth or falsity the prolusion in which the autobiographic statement about the epithet occur be such a mass of intentionally bury allusion that almost nothing in it can be accept a true or discard a false the entire exercise latin and english be most suggestive of the kind of person milton have become at christ s during he undergraduate career the mere fact that he be select though a a substitute to act a interlocutor or moderator for it or perhaps we should say with buck a father of the act be in itself a difficult phase of he development to grasp milton be to act a the archfool the supreme wit the lightly banter pater pater liber who could at once trip lightly over that which deserve such treatment or could at will annihilate the common enemy of the college gather and with word alone from an exercise involve merely raucous rough-and-tumble comedy in he hand the performance turn into a revel of wit and word play indecent at time but always learn point and carefully aim at some individual present and at the whole assembly to do this successfully require great skill and a special talent for both solemn and ribald raillery a talent not bestow on many person but one with which milton be mark a be endow and in which at least in this performance he obviously reveled it may be think unfortunate that he be call on entirely by accident to perform if again we may trust the open of the oratio for it mark the begin for we of he use of he peculiar form of witty word play that even in this latin banter have in it the unmistakable element of viciousness and an almost sadistic delight in verbally torment an adversary but the real beginning of this development in he go back to the oppose of grammar school and probably if it have not be this occasion and these latin line it would have be some other such a the first prolusion that set off this streak in he of unbridled and scathing verbal attack on an enemy all western europe would hear and listen to he in this same vein about the middle of the century but these prolusions that we have survive from the christ s college day be only one phase of he existence then perhaps he most important private activity be the combination of read discussion with a few if we can trust he writing to diodati and the young gill very few congenial companion line 23-36 of lycidas late point to a friendship with edward king who enter christ s college 9 june 1626 no other name among the young man in residence at the time seem to have be even suggest by milton a those of person with whom he in any way consort but that scarcely mean that he be the aloof forbid type of student who share few if any activity with he fellow the banter of the survive prolusions provide enough evidence to deny this apparently he be not a participant in the college or university theatrical which he once attack a utterly unworthy performance see apology 3300 but even in that famous passage milton be aim not at the theatrical a such but at they performance by person either enter d or presently to enter into the ministry the fact that he nowhere mention theatrical performance a part of the activity of the boy late in he hypothetical academy 1644 should not be take too seriously a evidence that he desire they to eschew such performance perhaps in that short piece or letter write to hartlib in which he sketch he scheme for educate young man he merely overlook that phase of they exercise
