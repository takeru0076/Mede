roy mason be essentially a landscape painter whose style and direction have a kinship with the english watercolorists of the early nineteenth century especially the beautifully pattern art of john sell cotman and like this english master mason realize he subject in large simplify mass which though they seem effortless be in reality the result of skilled design bear of hard work and a thorough distillation of the natural form that inspire they a a boy roy mason begin the long process of extract the goodness of the out-of-door it tang of weather it change of season it variable mood he father a professional engraver and an amateur landscape painter take he son on numerous hunt expedition and impart to they he knowledge and love of nature out of this background of hunt and fish it be only natural that roy first paint subject he know good hunter in the field fisherman in the stream duck and goose on the wing almost always against a vast backdrop of weather landscape it be this subject matter that have bring mason a large and enthusiastic follow among sportsman but it be he exceptional performance with this motif that commend he to artist and discern collector mason have to earn the privilege of devote himself exclusively to painting like many other he have to work hard long hour in a struggle family business which though it be ally to art of a kind the design and production of engrave seal bear no relation to the painting of picture but it do teach roy the basic technique of commercial art and late for twelve year he and he sister nina conduct an advertise art studio in philadelphia on the death of they father they return to they home in batavia new york after more year of concentrate effort roy and he brother max finally establish a thrive family business at the old stand during all this time roy continue to paint first only on weekend and then a the family business permit for long period gradually he withdraw from the shop altogether and for the past thirty year he have work independently a a painter except for he continue hunt and fish expedition but even on these the palette often take over while the shotgun cool off except for a rich friendship with the painter chauncey ryder who give he the only professional instruction he ever have and this be limit to a few lesson though the two artist often go on painting trip together roy develop he art by himself in the good tradition he first teach himself to see then to draw with accuracy and assurance and then to paint he work in oil for year before begin he work in watercolor and he first public recognition and early honor include he election to the academy be for he essay in the heavy medium gradually watercolor claim he great affection until today it have become he major if not exclusive technique it have be i privilege to paint with roy mason on numerous occasion mostly in the vicinity of batavia more often than not i have find easy excuse to leave i own work and stand at a respectable distance where i could watch this man transform raw nature into a compose not imitative painting what i have observe time and time again be a process of integration integration that begin a abstract design and gradually take on recognizable form color pattern that be make to weave throughout the whole composition and that over-all amaze control of large wash which be the mason stylemark finally come those little flick of a rigger brush and the job be do inspire yes instructive maybe duplicable no but for the technical fact we have the artist s own testimony of late year i find that i like good to work out-of-door first i make preliminary watercolor sketch in quarter scale approximately afj inch in which i pay particular attention to the design principle of three simple value the light light the middle tone and the dark dark by reduce the form of i subject to these large pattern if a human figure or wild life be to be part of the project final picture i try to place they in the initial sketch for i these will belong more completely to they surroundings if they be conceive in this early stage though i freely admit that i do not hesitate to add or eliminate figure on the full sheet when it serve i final purpose i be thoroughly convince that most watercolors suffer because the artist expect nature will do he compose for he a a result such picture be only a literal translation of what the artist find in the scene before he just because a tree or other object appear in a certain spot be absolutely no reason to place it in the same position in the painting unless the position serve the design of the whole composition if the artist would study he work more thoroughly and move certain unit in he design often only slightly fine picture would result out of long experience i have find that incidental figure and other object like tree log and bush can be trace from the original sketch and move about in the major area on the final sheet until they occupy the right position which i call click speed in painting a picture be valid only when it impart spontaneity and crispness but unless the artist have lot of experience so that he can control rapid execution he would do well to take these first sketch and soberly reorder they design to achieve a unify composition if i have seem to emphasize the structure of the composition i mean to project equal concern for color often in work out-of-door under all condition of light and atmosphere a particular passage that look favorable in relation to the subject will be too bright too dull or too light or too dark when view indoors in a mat when this occur i make the change on the sketch or on the final watercolor if i have be work on a full sheet in the field when work from one of i sketch i square it up and project it linear form freehand to the watercolor sheet with charcoal when this linear draft be complete i dust it down to a faint image from this point i paint in a direct a manner a possible by flow on the wash with a pure a color mixture a i can manage however first i thoughtfully study i sketch for improvement of color and design along the line i have describe then i plan i attack the part i will finish first the range of value the accent of minor detail all in all mechanic of produce the finish job with a maximum of crispness the long i work the more i be sure that for i at least a workmanlike method be important trial and error be good place in the preliminary sketch than in hope for miracle in the final painting a for material i use the good available i work on a watercolor easel in the field and frequently resort to a large garden umbrella to protect i eye from undue strain in i studio i work at a tilt-top table but leave the paper unfixed so that i can move it freely to control the wash i have use a variety of heavy-weight hand-made paper but prefer an english make rough surface in 400-pound weight after select a sheet and inspect it for flaw even the good sometimes have foreign nubbin on it surface i sponge it thoroughly on both side with clean cold water then i dry the sheet under mild pressure so that it will lie flat a a board in addition to the usual tool i make constant use of cleanse tissue not only to wipe i brush but to mop up certain area to soften edge and to open up light in dark wash the great absorbency of this tissue and the fact that it be easy to control than a sponge make it an ideal tool for the watercolorist i also use a small electric hand-blower to dry large wash in the studio i brush be different from those use by most watercolorists for i combine the sable and the bristle the red sable be 8 two rigger 6 and 10 and a very large flat wash brush the bristle be a fitch 2 and a one-half inch brush shave to a sharp chisel edge i usual palette consist of top-quality color alizarin crimson orange raw sienna raw umber burn sienna sepia cerulean blue cobalt blue french ultramarine blue winsor green hooker s green 2 cadmium yellow pale yellow ochre payne s gray charcoal gray davy s gray and ivory black in analyze the watercolors of roy mason the first thing that come to mind be they essential decorativeness yet this word have such a vary connotation that it need some elaboration here true a mason watercolor be unmistakably a synthesis of nature rather than a detail inventory unlike many decorative pattern that present a static flat convention this artist s picture be full of atmosphere and climate long observation have teach mason that most landscape can be reduce to three essential plane a foreground in sharp focus either a light area with dark accent or a dark one with light a middle distance often contain the major motif and a background usually a silhouette form foil against the sky in follow this general principle mason provide the observer with a natural eye progression from foreground to background and the illusion of depth be instantly create when painting mason s physical eye be half-closed while he mind s eye be wide open and this circumstance account in part for the impression he wish to convey he do not insist on tell all he know about any give subject rather he picture invite the observer to draw on he memory he imagination he nostalgia it be for this reason that roy avoid select subject that require specific recognition of place for they enjoyment he picture generalize though they be inspire by a particular locale they universalize in term of weather sky earth and people by deal with common landscape in an uncommon way roy mason have find a particular niche in american landscape art live with he watercolors be a vicarious experience of see nature distil through the eye of a sensitive interpretor a breath and breadth of the outdoor world to help man honor the creator of it all the artist be bear in gilbert mill new york in 1886 and until two year ago when he and he wife move to california he live in western new york in batavia when i look up the actual date of he birth and find it to be march 15th i realize that roy be bear under the right zodiacal sign for a watercolorist the water sign of pisces february 18 thru march 20 and how very often a water plane be feature in he landscape and how appropriate that he should appear in american artist again in he natal month of march over the year begin in 1929 mason have be award seventeen major
