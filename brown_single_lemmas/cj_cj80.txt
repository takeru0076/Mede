a gyro-stabilized platform system use restrain gyro be well suit for automatic leveling because of the characteristic of the gyro-platform-servo combination the restrain gyro-stabilized platform with reasonable response characteristic operate with an approximate equation of motion neglect transient effect a follow afj where u be a torque apply about the output axis of the control gyro the platform angle \*\* yf be the angle about which the gyro be control this be normally term the gyro input axis 90-degrees away from the gyro output or \*\* yj axis the gyro angular momentum be define by h thus if the gyro and platform-controller combination maintain the platform with zero angular deviation about the \*\* yf axis the system can be rotate with an angular velocity afj if a torque be supply to the gyro output axis afj it be assume that the gyro be design with electrical torquers so that a torque can be apply about they output ax in the system show in fig 7-1 the accelerometer output be amplify and the result voltage be apply to the gyro output-axis torquer this torque cause the entire system to rotate about the \*\* yf axis since the response to afj if the polarity be correct the platform rotate in such a direction a to reduce the accelerometer output to zero a the accelerometer output be decrease the torque apply to the gyro output axis decrease and therefore the rate decrease finally when the accelerometer output be zero the entire system remain stationary and the platform be by definition leveled a mathematical block diagram for the leveling system be show in fig 7-2 the platform be initially off level by the angle afj the angle generate by the platform servo \*\* yf multiply by g be the effective acceleration act on the accelerometer afj be the scale factor of the accelerometer afj the voltage afj be amplify by afj and apply to the gyro torquer with scale factor afj finally the gyro-stabilized platform characteristic be represent by afj the system a indicate in fig 7-2 be fundamental and simple because the transient effect of both the platform servo and the accelerometer have be neglect with these factor include an upper limit be place on the allowable loop gain by stability consideration in this type of system a high loop gain be desirable because it provide a fast response time when the frequency response characteristic of practical component be consider they effect on stability do not present the most serious limit on the system loop gain the time require for the system to reach a level position be approximately inversely proportional to the servo loop gain in addition the cutoff frequency for input acceleration be approximately proportional to the servo loop gain ie high loop gain cause the system to respond to horizontal component of acceleration this problem usually determine the low limit of loop gain rather than response time it must be notice in fig 7-1 that the accelerometer respond to any input acceleration the equation relate input acceleration to output platform angle be afj in practice the preflight leveling process take place with the system mount in the airframe when the system be arrange for automatic leveling the platform angle respond to any horizontal component of acceleration act on the accelerometer there be many such component of acceleration present due to the effect of wind gust engine noise turbulence around the vehicle etc one of the great problem associate with automatic leveling be establish a true level in the presence of high-level acceleration noise one solution to the problem be to operate with a low loop gain and to include low-pass filter this technique cause the system to respond only to low frequency acceleration component such a the platform tilt since a low loop gain and low-pass filter increase the response time a practical compromise must be reach one of the most desirable solution be achieve by the use of a non-linear amplifier for afj the amplifier be design so that it gain be large for accelerometer signal above a certain threshold level below this level the amplifier gain afj be proportional and be of small value in order to provide adequate noise filter the effect be that the platform return from an off-level position at a rapid rate until it be nearly level at which point the platform be control by a proportional servo with low enough frequency response so that the noise have little effect on the leveling process when the system be on automatic leveling the gyro drift be cancel by the output of the leveling system amplifier afj the platform actually tilt off level so that the accelerometer output when amplify by afj will supply the correct current to the gyro torquer to cancel the gyro drift the amount of platform dip require depend upon the scale factor of the system 7-3 practical leveling consideration the automatic leveling system describe in this section be readily adaptable to a gyro-stabilized platform consist of three integrate gyro the system require some switch of flight equipment circuit however the leveling operation can be maintain and control remotely with no mechanical or optical contact with the platform this leveling system will hold the platform on-level automatically a long a the system be actuate a useful by-product of this system be that the information necessary to set the gyro drift biase be available from the current necessary to hold the system in level the leveling process can be accomplish manually and the result be a satisfactory a those obtain with automatic equipment the process consist in turn the platform manually until the output of both accelerometer be zero the turn be accomplish by apply voltage to the gyro torquers describe above in brief the human replace amplifier afj in fig 7-1 and 7-2 manual leveling require an appropriate display of the accelerometer output if high accuracy be require in preflight leveling it be usually necessary to integrate or doubly integrate the accelerometer output this also minimize the noise problem with integration the effect of a small acceleration or small platform tilt angle can be see after a time however skill be require on the part of an operator to level a platform to any degree of accuracy also it require more time a compare to the automatic approach manual leveling be inconvenient if the platform must be maintain accurately level for any prolong period of time the operator must continually supply the correct amount of turn current to the gyro torquers so that the effect of gyro drift be cancel this process be especially difficult since gyro drift be typically random 7-4 platform head platform head consist of orient the sensitive axis of the accelerometer parallel to the desire coordinate system of the navigator in simple term it amount to point the platform in the proper direction for purely inertial navigator two technique be available to accomplish the platform head use of external or survey equipment to establish proper head use of the characteristic of the platform component for an indication of true head the choice of the head technique be dependent upon the accuracy requirement field condition and the time available to accomplish the head 7-5 external determination of head survey technique with the gyro-stabilized platform leveled it can be head in the proper direction by use survey technique the platform accelerometer must be slightly modify for this procedure before the accelerometer be mount on the platform the direction of they sensitive axis must be accurately determine a mirror be mount on each accelerometer so that the plane of the mirror be perpendicular to the sensitive axis of the unit transit a precision transit be set up so that it be align with respect to true north this can be do to a high degree of accuracy by exist survey technique with the transit set up a mirror on one of the accelerometer be sight and the platform be turn until it be align the sight procedure include the use of a fixture for the transit to project a beam of light which be darken by cross hair on the accelerometer mirror when the platform be align the reflect image of the cross hair can be see exactly superimpose upon the original cross hair the image can easily be align with a high degree of accuracy the platform be turn a require by supply current to the appropriate gyro torquers although this technique be simple and satisfactory one practical difficulty do exist the direction of true north must be know for each launch point however this difficulty be not too serious if it be realize that a survey team can establish a true north base line with a few day work in many installation the inertial platform be raise off the ground a considerable height when it be mount in the vehicle before flight with this situation it be difficult to sight in on the platform with survey equipment if the platform be not too high off the ground a transit can be mount on a stand to raise it up to the platform obviously the head accuracy be lessen by such technique since error be introduce because of motion of the stand autocollimator the transit can be replace by an autocollimator this instrument provide an electrical signal proportional to the angular deviation of the platform and can be use to automatically hold the platform on true head the electrical signal from the autocollimator be amplify and supply to the z-gyro torquer if the polarity be correct the platform will turn until the head error angle be zero information be also available from this autocollimator system to set the drift bias for the z-axis gyro if the z gyro be drift a current generate by the autocollimator be deliver to the gyro torquer to cancel the drift if the drift error be systematic it can be cancel with a bias circuit which can be arrange and adjust to supply the require compensate current electrical pickoffs it be possible to locate an angular electrical pickoff which will indicate the angular deviation between the true head direction and the platform essentially the stator or reference portion of the pickoff be establish with respect to the true head direction and the platform be turn either manually or automatically until the angular electrical pickoff signal be reduce to zero 7-6 gyrocompass head gyrocompass alignment be an automatic head system which depend upon the characteristic of one gyro to establish true head for the case of a purely inertial autonavigator consist of three restrain gyro a coordinate system be use where the sensitive axis of the x accelerometer be parallel to the east-west direction at the base point and the y accelerometer sensitive axis be parallel to the north-south direction at the base point the accelerometer be mount rigidly on the platform thus if one accelerometer be properly align the other be also the input axis of the appropriate gyro be parallel to the sensitive direction of the accelerometer figure 7-3 show a platform system with the gyro vector arrange a describe above the platform be leveled and properly head so that the x-gyro input axis be parallel to the east-west direction and the y-gyro input axis be parallel to the north-south direction the input axis of the x gyro when point in the east-west direction be always perpendicular to the spin axis of earth if the platform be not properly head the x-gyro input axis will see a component of the earth s rotation the sense of this rotation by the x gyro can be utilize to direct the platform into proper head in fig 7-4 the input axis of the three-axis platform be show at some point on the earth the point be at a latitude \*\* yl and the platform be at an error in head east the earth be spin at an angular velocity \*\* zq equal to one revolution per 24 hr when the platform be level \*\* you be a rotation about the z axis of the platform afj since the earth be rotate and the unleveled gyro-stabilized platform be fix with respect to a reference in space an observer on the earth will see the platform rotate with respect to the earth
