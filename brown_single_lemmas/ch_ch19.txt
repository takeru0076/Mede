while there should be no general age limit or restriction to one sex there will be particular project require special maturity and some open only to man or to woman the peace corps should not pay the expense of a wife or family unless the wife be also accept for full-time peace corps work on the same project there should be no draft exemption because of peace corps service in most case service in the corps will probably be consider a ground for temporary deferment peace corps volunteer obviously should not be pay what they might earn in comparable activity in the unite state nor would it be possible in many case for they to live in health or any effectiveness on what they counterpart abroad be pay the guide principle indeed should not be anything like compensation for individual service rather the principle should be akin to that of the allowance peace corps volunteer should be give just enough to provide a minimum decent standard of live they should live in modest circumstance avoid all conspicuous consumption wherever possible they should live with they host country counterpart some special health requirement might have to be meet for example it probably will be necessary for the corps to have authority to pay medical expense of volunteer perhaps exist public health service state department and arm service medical facility can be utilize for readjustment to the we volunteer should be give some separation allowance at the end of they overseas service base on the length of time serve 7 in what part of the government should the peace corps be establish the idea of a peace corps have capture the imagination of a great many people support for it cut across party regional ethnic and other line the peace corps therefore offer an opportunity to add a new dimension to we approach to the world an opportunity for the american people to think anew and start afresh in they participation in world development for this the peace corps should be administer by a small new alive agency operate a one component in we whole overseas operation pending the reorganization of we foreign aid structure and program the peace corps should be establish a an agency in the department of state when the aid operation be reorganize the peace corps should remain a semi-autonomous functional unit meanwhile the peace corps could be physically locate in ica s facility and depend on the state department and ica for administrative support and when need program assistance in this way the peace corps can be launch with it own identity and spirit and yet receive the necessary assistance from those now responsible for unite state foreign policy and we overseas operation 8 how and when should the peace corps be launch the peace corps can either begin in very low gear with only preparatory work undertake between now and when congress finally appropriate special fund for it or it can be launch now and in earnest by executive action with sufficient fund and make available from exist mutual security appropriation to permit a number of substantial project to start this summer the peace corps should be launch soon so that the opportunity to recruit the most qualify people from this year s graduate class will not be lose nor should we lose the opportunity to use this summer for train on university campuses if launch in a careful but determine way within the next few week the peace corps could have several hundred person in train this summer for placement next fall within a year or two several thousand might be in service it can then grow steadily a it prove itself and a the need for it be demonstrate 9 what would the first project be in the first year there should probably be considerable emphasis on teach project the need here be most clearly feel and we capacity to recruit and train qualify volunteer in a short period of time be great there would however be a variety of other skill medical agricultural engineering which would be call for in the first year through the private agency program and through the provision of technician helper to exist development project the first year s project should also be spread through several country in latin america africa and asia 10 how will the peace corps be receive abroad although the need for outside train manpower exist in every newly develop nation the readiness to receive such manpower or to receive it from the unite state will vary from country to country a certain skepticism about the come of american be to be expect in many quarter unfriendly political group will no doubt do everything in they power to promote active hostility but there be indication that many develop nation will welcome peace corps volunteer and that if the volunteer be well choose they will soon demonstrate they value and make many friend it be important however that the peace corps be advance not a an arm of the cold war but a a contribution to the world community in present it to other government and to the unite nation we could propose that every nation consider the formation of it own peace corps and that the unite nation sponsor the idea and form an international coordinate committee we should hope that peace corps project will be truly international and that we citizen will find themselves work alongside citizen of the host country and also volunteer from other land in any case we peace corps personnel should be offer a technician helper in development project of the un and other international agency the peace corps be not a diplomatic or propaganda venture but a genuine experiment in international partnership we aim must be to learn a much a we teach the peace corps offer an opportunity to bring home to the unite state the problem of the world a well a an opportunity to meet urgent host country need for train manpower if present in this spirit the response and the result will be immeasurably good 11 how will it be finance the already appropriate fund within the discretion of the president and secretary of state under the mutual security act be the only immediately available source of finance this summer s pilot program of the peace corps if it be decide to make a small shift which may be require from military aid or special assistance fund in order to carry out the purpose of the mutual security act through this new peaceful program this will be a hopeful sign to the world congress should then be ask to give the peace corps a firm legislative foundation for the next fiscal year specifically congress should consider authorize the peace corps to receive contribution from american business union civic organization and the public at large for this must be the project of the whole american people an advisory council of outstanding public figure with experience in world affair should be form to give the program continue guidance and to afford a focal point for public understand step should also be take to link the food for peace program with the peace corps so that foreign currency accumulate by the sale of we surplus food under pl 480 can be put to use to pay some of the host country expense of peace corps personnel the extent to which participate body such a we voluntary agency university international organization and the host country or institution in the host country can and should share the cost of the peace corps program must be fully explore 12 be it worth the cost and the risk no matter how well conceive and efficiently run there probably will be failure these could be costly and have a serious effect both at home and abroad but a the popular response suggest the potentiality of the peace corps be very great it can contribute to the development of critical country and region it can promote international cooperation and good will toward this country it can also contribute to the education of america and to more intelligent american participation in the world with thousands of young american go to work in develop area millions of american will become more directly involve in the world than ever before with college and university carry a large part of the program and with student look toward peace corps service there will be an impact on educational curriculum and student seriousness the letter home the talk late give by return member of the peace corps the influence on the life of those who spend two or three year in hard work abroad all this may combine to provide a substantial popular base for responsible american policy toward the world and this be meet the world s need too since what the world most need from this country be good understand of the world the peace corps thus can add a new dimension to america s world policy one for which people here and abroad have long be wait a you say in you state of the union message the problem be tower and unprecedented and the response must be tower and unprecedented a well to the congress of the unite state i recommend to the congress the establishment of a permanent peace corps a pool of train american man and woman send overseas by the we government or through private organization and institution to help foreign country meet they urgent need for skilled manpower i have today sign an executive order establish a peace corps on a temporary pilot basis the temporary peace corps will be a source of information and experience to aid we in formulate more effective plan for a permanent organization in addition by start the peace corps now we will be able to begin train young man and woman for overseas duty this summer with the objective of place they in overseas position by late fall this temporary peace corps be be establish under exist authority in the mutual security act and will be locate in the department of state it initial expense will be pay from appropriation currently available for we foreign aid program throughout the world the people of the newly develop nation be struggle for economic and social progress which reflect they deep desire we own freedom and the future of freedom around the world depend in a very real sense on they ability to build grow and independent nation where man can live in dignity liberate from the bond of hunger ignorance and poverty one of the great obstacle to the achievement of this goal be the lack of train man and woman with the skill to teach the young and assist in the operation of development project man and woman with the capacity to cope with the demand of swiftly evolve economics and with the dedication to put that capacity to work in the village the mountain the town and the factory of dozens of struggle nation the vast task of economic development urgently require skilled people to do the work of the society to help teach in the school construct development project demonstrate modern method of sanitation in the village and perform a hundred other task call for train and advance knowledge to meet this urgent need for skilled manpower we be propose the establishment of a peace corps an organization which will recruit and train american volunteer send they abroad to work with the people of other nation this organization will differ from exist assistance program in that it member will supplement technical adviser by offer the specific skill need by develop nation if they be to put technical advice to work they will help provide the skilled manpower necessary to carry out the development project plan by the host government act at a work level and serve at great personal sacrifice there be little doubt that the number of those who wish to serve will be far great than we capacity to absorb they
