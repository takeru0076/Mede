shelter to the editor sir i read of a man who feel he should not build a fallout shelter in he home because it would be selfish for he to sit secure while he neighbor have no shelter do this man live in a neighborhood where all be free loader unwilling to help themselves but ready to demand that the community help and protect they community shelter be of course necessary for those have no space for shelter if in a town of 2000 private home half of they have shelter the need for the community shelter will be reduce to that extent in design he home fallout shelter there be nothing to prevent a

busy and be the first member of we plus-one shelter club escape to the editor sir people continue to inquire the reason for the race for outer space it s simple enough from i point of view i be for it it be the only method leave for a man to escape from a woman s world support katanga to the editor sir when the colony decide upon freedom from england we insist through the declaration of independence that the nation of the world recognize we a a separate political entity it be high time the unite state begin to realize that the god-given right of man set forth in that document be applicable today to katanga in the unite nation charter the right of self-determination be also an essential principle this again apply to katanga the people of katanga have fight for and obtain they freedom from the communist yoke of antoine gizenga and he cohort by political economic geographic and natural standard they be justify in do so the unite state and the un denounce they own principle when they defend the communist oppressor and refuse to acknowledge the right of self-determination of the katangans county college cost to the editor sir permit i to commend you editorial in which you stress the fact that a program of county college will substantially increase local tax burden and that taxpayer have a right to a clear idea of what such a program would commit they to the bill which pass the assembly last may and be now pending in the senate should be give careful scrutiny the procedure for determine the amount of money to be spend by county college and raise by taxation will certainly startle many taxpayer under the proposal the member of the board of trustee of a county college will be appoint none will be elect the trustee will prepare an annual budget for the college and submit it to the board of school estimate this board will consist of two of the trustee of the college and the director and two member of the board of freeholder it will determine the amount of money to be spend by the college and will certify this amount to the board of freeholder which shall appropriate in the same manner a other appropriation be make by it the amount so certify and the amount shall be assess levy and collect in the same manner a money appropriate for other purpose the approval of only three member of the board of school estimate be require to certify the amount of money to be allot to the college since two of these could be trustee of the college actually it would be necessary to have the consent of only one elect official to impose a levy of millions of dollar of tax revenue this be taxation without representation tax improvement to the editor sir you editorial house speedup be certainly not the answer to we slum problem the very rule and regulation in every city be the primary case of slum condition change we tax law so that no tax shall be charge to any owner for addition or improvement to he property then see what a boom in all trade a well a slum clearance at no cost to taxpayer will happen we entire economy will have a terrific uplift natural cause to the editor sir an old man be kick to death by mugger the medical examiner state that

give i little dog a biscuit it be very refresh deep peep show the viewer of the deep peep show at 15th and m street nw have an add attraction the view of a fossilize cypress swamp twenty foot below the street level in the excavation of the new motel to be construct on this site a black coal-like deposit have be encounter this be a black swamp clay in which about one hundred million year ago cypress-like tree be grow the fossilize remain of many of these tree be find embed in the clay some of the stump be a much a three foot long but most of they have be flatten by the pressure of the overlie sediment although the wood have be change to coal much of it still retain it original cell structure in the clay be entomb millions of pollen grain and spore which come from plant grow in the region at the time these microfossil indicate the swamp be form during the low cretaceous period when dinosaur be at they heyday and when the first flower plant be just appear the 15th street deposit be not to be confuse with the nearby famous mayflower hotel cypress swamp on 17th street report in the washington post august 2 1955 which be probably form during the second interglacial period and be therefore much young work for peace recently the secretary of the friend committee on national legislation be interview on the air while i respect he sincere concern for peace he make four point that i would like to question 1 he say let s work for peace instead of protection from aggression i would ask why not do both military power do not cause war war be the result of mistrust and lack of understand between people be we not late especially those of we who call ourselves friend in do enough about this lack of understand 2 a to protection the speaker disapprove of shelter point out that fallout shelter would not save everyone be this a reason for save no one would the man with an empty life boat row away from a shipwreck because he boat could not pick up everyone 3 the speaker suggest that the desolation of a post-attack world would be too awful to face if the world come to this would nt it be the very time when courage and american know-how would be need to help survivor rebuild many of we young people think it would 4 lastly the speaker decry we organize program of emergency help call it civilian defense in 1950 public law 920 create civil defense different from civilian-groups of world war 2 a responsibility of the government at all level to help reduce loss of life and property in disaster natural or manmade far from create fear a the speaker suggest preparedness know what to do in an emergency give people confidence civil defense have far to go and many problem to solve but be it not in the good spirit of we pioneer tradition to be not only will but prepare to care for we own family and help we neighbor in any disaster storm flood accident or even war pet in apartment it seem rather peculiar that resident of apartment be deny the right of provide themselves with the protection and companionship of dog i feel that few burglar would be prone to break and enter into someone s apartment if they be meet with a good hardy growl that a dog would provide in addition would not the young female public of washington be afford a great degree of protection at night when they be on the street if they be accompany by a dog on a leash i grant that the dog may not be really protective base on he train but if you be roam the street look for a purse to snatch or a young lady to molest how quick would you be to attack a person stroll with a dog i would like to suggest that the landlord and commissioner get together and consider liberalize the practice of prohibit dog in apartment sidewalk cafe use the terrace of the capitol for a sidewalk cafe could senator humphrey be serious in he proposal be nothing in this country more sacred than the tourist comfort perhaps the idea of sidewalk cafe could be extend the lincoln and jefferson memorial be rather bleak why not put a cafe in each so the tourist would not have to travel too far to eat unfortunately the cafe might not make enough money to support themselves during the off season a an add suggestion to balance the budget the government could sell advertise space on the washington monument it be visible throughout the city and man from madison ave would jump at the chance sen hubert humphrey be obviously a man with a soul and heart he like most of we want to be able to sit to contemplate and be move by the great outdoors let we have more bench and fewer forbid area around fountain and garden let we like the french have outdoor cafe where we may relax converse at leisure and enjoy the pass crowd dissent view of senator two strong dissent from the majority
