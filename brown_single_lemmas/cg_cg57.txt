but it would not be very satisfactory to leave we conclusion at the point just reach fortunately it be possible to be somewhat more concrete and factual in diagnose the involvement of value in education for this purpose we now draw upon data from sociological and psychological study of student in american college and university and particularly from the cornell value study in the latter research program information be available for 2758 cornell student survey in 1950 and for 1571 student survey in 1952 of the latter sample 944 person have be study two year early hence change in attitude and value can be analyze for identical individual at two point in time in addition the 1952 study collect comparable data from 4585 student at ten other college and university scatter across the country dartmouth harvard yale wesleyan north carolina fisk texas university of california at los angeles wayne and michigan we find in the first place that the student overwhelmingly approve of high education positively evaluate the job they own institution be do do not accept most of the criticism level against high education in the public print and on the whole approve of the way they university deal with value-problems and value inculcation it be not we impression that these evaluation be naively uncritical resultant of blissful ignorance rather the generality of these student find they university experience congenial to they own sense of value student be approximately equally divide between those who regard vocational preparation a the primary goal of an ideal education and those who choose a general liberal education other conceivable goal such a character-education and social adjustment be of secondary importance to they the ideal of a liberal education impress itself upon the student more and more a they move through college even in such technical curriculum a engineering the senior be much more likely than the freshman to choose a an ideal liberal education over specific vocational preparation in the university milieu of scholarship and research of social diversity of new idea and vary and wide-ranging interest socialization into a campus culture apparently mean heighten appreciation of the idea of a liberal education in the art and science student choice of ideal educational goal be not arbitrary or whimsical there be a clear relationship between they educational evaluation and they basic pattern of general value the selective and directional quality of basic value-orientation be clearly evident in these data the success-oriented student choose vocational preparation the other-directed choose goal of social adjustment get along with people the intellectual choose a liberal art emphasis the same pattern consistency show itself in occupational choice there be impressive consistency between specific occupational preference and the student s basic conception of what be for he a good way of life and contrary to many popular assertion the goal-values choose do not seem to we to be primarily orient to materialistic success nor to mere conformity we student want occupation that permit they to use they talent and train to be creative and original to work with and to help other people they also want money prestige and security but they be optimistic about they prospect in these regard they set limit to they aspiration few aspire to millions of dollar or to imperial power and glory within the fix frame of these aspiration they can afford to place a high value on the expressive and people-oriented aspect of occupation and to minimize the instrumental-reward value of power prestige and wealth occupational choice be also useful and interest in bring out clearly that value do not constitute the only component in goal and aspiration for there be also the face of reality in the form of the individual s perception of he own ability and interest of the objective possibility open to he of the familial and other social pressure to which he be expose we find reluctant recruit whose value be not in line with they expect occupation s characteristic student develop occupational image not always accurate or detail and they try to fit they value to the presume characteristic of the imagine occupation the purely cognitive or informational problem be often acute furthermore many reluctant recruit be yield to social demand or compromise in the face of they own limitation of opportunity or of ability and performance thus many a creativity-oriented aspirant for a career in architecture drama or journalism resign himself to a real estate business many a people-oriented student who dream of the md decide to enter he father s advertise agency and many a hopeful incipient business executive decide it be good to teach the theory of business administration than to practice it the old ideal of the independent entrepreneur be extant but so be the recognition that the main chance may be in a corporate bureaucracy in they view on date courtship sex and family life we student prefer what they be expect to prefer for they in the grim word of a once-popular song love and marriage go together like a horse and carriage they express standard concern sex role desirable age for marriage characteristic of an ideal mate number of child desire be congruent with the value and stereotype of the precede generation minus compulsive rebellion they even accept the double standard of sex morality in a double sense ie both sex agree that standard for man differ from standard for woman and woman apply to both sex a standard different from that hold by man conservatism and traditionalism seem imply by what have just be say but these term be treacherous in the field of political value it be certainly true that student be not radical not rebel against they parent or they peer and a they go through college the student tend to bring they political position in line with that prevalent in the social group to which they belong yet they have accept most of the extant welfare state provision for health security and the regulation of economic affair and they overwhelmingly approve of the traditional liberalism of the bill of right when they faith in civil liberty be test against strong pressure of social expediency in specific issue eg suppression of dangerous idea many waver and give in the student who be most will to acquiesce in the suppression of civil liberty be also those who be most likely to be prejudice against minority group to be conformist and traditionalistic in general social attitude and to lack a basic faith in people a one look at the exist evidence one find a correlation although only a slight one between high grade and libertarian value but the correlation be substantial only among upperclassmen in other word a student go through college those who be most successful academically tend to become more commit to a bill of right orientation college in gross just the general experience may have vary effect but the student who be successful emerge with strengthen and clarify democratic value this find be consistent also with the fact that student leader be more likely to be supporter of the value implicit in civil liberty than the other student there be now substantial evidence from several major study of college student that the experience of the college year result in a certain selective homogenization of attitude and value detach from they prior statuses and social group and expose to the pervasive stimulus of the university milieu the student tend to assimilate a new common culture to converge toward norm characteristic of they own particular campus furthermore in certain respect there be norm common to college and university across the country for instance college-educated people consistently show up in study after study a more often than other supporter of the bill of right and other democratic right and liberty the interest thing in this connection be that the norm upon which student tend to converge include toleration of diversity to the extent that we sample of the orientation of american college student in the year 1950 and 1952 may be representative of we culture and still valid in 1959 we be dispose to question the summary characterization of the current generation a silent beat apathetic or a a mass of other-directed conformist who be guide solely by social radar without benefit of inner gyroscope we data indicate that these student of today do basically accept the exist institution of the society and in the face of the reality of complex and large-scale economic and political problem make a wary and ambivalent delegation of trust to those who occupy position of legitimize responsibility for cope with such collective concern in a real sense they be admittedly conservative but they conservatism incorporate a traditionalized embodiment of the original radicalism of 1776 although we have no measure of it strength or intensity the heritage of the doctrine of inalienable right be retain a they move through the college year we young man and woman be socialize into a broadly similar culture at the level of personal behavior in this sense also they be surely conformist it be even true that some among they use the sheer fact of conformity everyone do it a a criterion for conduct but the extent of ethical robotism be easily overestimate few student be really so faceless in the not-so-lonely crowd of the swell population in we institution of high learn and it may be well to recall that to say conformity be in part another way of say orderly human society in the field of religious belief and value the college student seem to faithfully reflect the surround culture they commitment be for the most part couch in a familiar idiom student testify to a feel need for a religious faith or ultimate personal philosophy avow atheist or freethinker be so rare a to be a curiosity the religious quest be often intense and deep and there be student on every campus who be seriously wrestle with the most profound question of mean and value at the same time a major proportion of these young man and woman see religion a a mean of personal adjustment an anchor for family life a source of emotional security these personal and social goal often overshadow the goal of intellectual clarity and spiritual transcendence the cult of adjustment do exist it exist alongside the acceptance of traditional form of organize religion church ordain personnel ritual dogma still another segment of the student population consist of those who seek in what they regard a religion intellectual clarity rational belief and ethical guidance and reinforcement we first impression of the data be that the student be surprisingly orthodox and religiously involve upon second think we be force to realize that we have very few reliable historical benchmark against which we might compare the present situation and that conclusion that present-day student be more or less religious could not be defend on the basis of we data a we look more intently at the content of we belief and the extent of religious participation we receive the impression that many of the religious conviction express represent a conventional acceptance of low intensity but here again comparative benchmark be lack and we do not know in any case what measure of profoundity and intensity to expect from healthy young secure and relatively inexperience person after all feeling of immortality and invulnerability be standard illusion of youth nor be optimistic and socially-oriented theme at all rare in the distinctive religious history of this country kluckhohn recently have summarize evidence regard change in value during a period of year primarily 1935-1955 but extend much far back in some instance a variety of data be assemble to bear upon such allege change a diminish puritan morality work-success ethic individualism achievement lessen emphasis on future-time orientation in favor of sociability moral relativism consideration and tolerance conformity hedonistic present-time orientation although he question the extent and nature of the allege revival of religion and the allege increase in conformity and think that hedonistic present-time orientation do not have the mean usually attribute to it he do conclude that american increasingly enjoy leisure without guilt do not stress achievement so much a formerly be more accept of group harmony a a goal more tolerant of diversity and aware of other culture
