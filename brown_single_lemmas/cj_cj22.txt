these society can expect to face difficult time a the historic process of modernization gradually gain momentum they cohesion will be threaten by divisive force the gap between ruler and subject town and country will widen new aspirant for power will emerge whose ambition far exceed they competence old ruler may lose they nerve and they sense of direction national leader will have to display the high skill of statesmanship to guide they people through time of uncertainty and confusion which destroy man s sense of identity feeling of a community of interest will have to be recreat in some of the new nation indeed they must be build for the first time on a new basis which look toward the future and do not rely only on share memory of the past nevertheless with foresight and careful plan some of the more disruptive and dangerous consequence of social change which have trouble other country pass through this stage can be escape the unite state can help by communicate a genuine concern with the problem these country face and a readiness to provide technical and other appropriate form of assistance where possible we central goal should be to provide the great positive incentive for these society to tackle boldly the task which they face at the same time we should recognize that the obstacle to change and the lack of cohesion and stability which characterize these country may make they particularly prone to diversion and external adventure of all sort it may seem to some of they that success can be purchase much less dearly by fish in the murky water of international politics than by face up to the intractable task at home we should do what we can to discourage this conclusion both by offer assistance for they domestic need and by react firmly to irresponsible action on the world scene when necessary we should make it clear that country which choose to derive marginal advantage from the cold war or to exploit they potential for disrupt the security of the world will not only lose we sympathy but also risk they own prospect for orderly development a a nation we feel an obligation to assist other country in they development but this obligation pertain only to country which be honestly seek to become responsible member of a stable and forward-moving world community transitional society when we look at country like iran iraq pakistan and burma where substantial progress have be make in create a minimum supply of modern man and of social overhead capital and where institution of centralize government exist we find a second category of country with a different set of problem and hence different priority for policy the man in power be commit in principle to modernization but economic and social change be proceed only erratically isolate enterprise have be launch but they be not yet relate to each other in a meaningful pattern the society be likely to be characterize by have a fairly modernize urban sector and a relatively untouched rural sector with very poor communication between the two progress be impede by psychological inhibition to effective action among those in power and by a failure on they part to understand how local resource human and material can be mobilize to achieve the national goal of modernization already symbolically accept most country in this second category share the difficulty of have many of the structure of a modern political and social system without the modern standard of performance require to make they effective in these rapidly change society there be also too little appreciation of the need for effort to achieve goal the colonial period have generally leave people believe that government can if it wish provide all manner of service for they and that with independence free man do not have to work to realize the benefit of modern life for example in accordance with the fashion of the time most transitional society have announce economic development plan of vary number of year such be the mystique of plan that people expect that fulfillment of the plan will follow automatically upon it announcement the civil service in such society be generally inadequate to deal competently with the problem face they and they member often equate a government career with security and status rather than with sacrifice self-discipline and competence american policy should press constantly the view that until these government demand efficiency and effectiveness of they bureaucracy there be not the slight hope that they will either modernize of democratize they society we should spread the view that plan and national development be serious matter which call for effort a well a enthusiasm above all we should seek to encourage the leader of these society to accept the unpleasant fact that they be responsible for they fate only within the framework of a mature relationship characterize by honest appraisal of performance can we provide tell assistance with respect to those country whose leader prefer to live with they illusion we can afford to wait for in time they comparative lack of progress will become clear for all to see we technical assistance to these country should place special emphasis on induce the central government to assume the role of advisor and guide which at an early stage foreign expert assume in deal with the central government we should encourage the government to develop they own technical assistance to community state and provincial government rural community and other small group make certain that no important segment of the economy be neglect simultaneously we should be underline the interrelationship of technical progress in various field show how agricultural train can be introduce into education how health affect labor productivity how small business can benefit the rural farm community and above all how progress in each field relate to national progress effort such a the community development program in the philippines have demonstrate that transitional society can work toward balance national development to achieve this goal of balance development communication between the central government and the local community must be such that the need and aspiration of the people themselves be effectively take into account if modernization program be impose from above without the understand and cooperation of the people they will encounter grave difficulty land reform be likely to be a press issue in many of these country it should be american policy not only to encourage effective land reform program but also to underline the relation of such reform to the economic growth and modernization of the society a an isolate policy land reform be likely to be politically disruptive a part of a large development effort however it may gain wide acceptance it should also be recognize that the problem of rural tenancy can not be solve by administrative decree alone land reform program need to be supplement with program for promote rural credit and technical assistance in agriculture lastly governmental and private planner will at this stage begin to see large capital requirement loom ahead by hold out prospect for external capital assistance the unite state can provide strong incentive to prepare for the concerted economic drive necessary to achieve self-sustaining growth actively modernize society at a third stage in the modernization process be such country a india brazil the philippines and taiwan which be ready and commit to move into the stage of self-sustaining growth they must continue to satisfy basic capital need and there persist the dual problem of maintain operational unity around a national program of modernization while simultaneously decentralize participation in the program to wide and wide group but these country have make big stride toward develop the necessary human and social overhead capital they have establish reasonably stable and effective governmental institution at national and local level and they have begin to develop a capacity to deal realistically and simultaneously with all the major sector of they economy on the economic front the first priority of these country be to mobilize a vastly increase volume of resource several relate task must be carry out if self-sustaining growth be to be achieve these country must formulate a comprehensive long-term program cover the objective of both the private and the public sector of the economy they must in they plan be able to count on at least tentative commitment of foreign capital assistance over period of several year capital import draw from a number of source must be employ and combine skillfully enough to permit domestic investment program to go forward capital flow must be coordinate with national need and plan finally a balance must be effect among project finance utilization of agricultural surpluses and general balance of payment support thus although the agenda of external assistance in the economic sphere be cumulative and many of the policy suggest for nation in the early stage remain relevant the basic purpose of american economic policy during the late stage of development should be to assure that movement into a stage of self-sustaining growth be not prevent by lack of foreign exchange there remain many political and administrative problem to be solve for one thing although considerable number of man have be train bureaucracy be still deficient in many respect even the famed indian civil service be not fully adequate to the tremendous range of task it have undertake technical assistance in train middle - and upper-level management personnel be still need in many case there be also more basic problem this be the stage at which democratic development must take place if the society be to become an open community of creative people nevertheless impulse still exist among the rule elite to rationalize and thus to perpetuate the need for centralize and authoritarian practice another great danger be that the emerge middle class will feel itself increasingly alienate from the political leader who still justify they dominance by reference to the struggle for independence or the early phase of nationalism the capacity of intellectual and member of the new professional class to contribute creatively to national development be likely to be destroy by a constrain sense of inferiority toward both they own political class and they colleague and professional counterpart in the west particularly when base upon a single dominant party government may respond to such a situation by claim a monopoly of understand about the national interest convince of the wisdom of they own action and reassure by the promise of they economic development program government may fail to push outward to win more and more people to the national effort become instead more rigid and inflexible in they policy american policy toward such society should stress we sympathy for the emerge social and professional class it should attempt to communicate both an appreciation of professional standard and an understand of the tremendous power and potentiality of genuinely open and pluralistic society we have every obligation to take seriously they claim to be democratic and free country we also have in consequence the duty to appraise realistically and honestly they performance and to communicate we judgment to they leader in frank but friendly way the time factor we have emphasize that the modernize process in each society will take a considerable period of time with the exception of treaty-making foreign relation be historically concern for the most part with condition of short or at least measurable duration foreign policy now take on a different perspective and must become skilled not merely at response but also at projection american and free-world policy can marginally affect the pace of transition but basically that pace depend on change in the supply of resource and in the human attitude political institution and social structure which each society must generate it follow that any effective policy toward the underdeveloped country must have a realistically long work horizon it must be mark by a patience and persistence which have not always be it trademark this condition affect not only the conception but also the legislative and financial support of foreign policy especially in the context of economic aid
