los angeles in 1957 finally bow to the skyscraper and without high density in the core rapid-transit system can not be maintain economically let alone build from scratch at today s price however the build of freeway and garage can not continue forever the new interchange among the four los angeles freeway include the grade-constructed access occupy by itself no less than eighty acre of downtown land one-eighth of a square mile an area about the size of rockefeller center in new york it be hard to believe that this mass of intertwine concrete constitute what the law call the high and good use of centrally locate urban land a it affect the city s fiscal situation such an interchange be ruinous it remove forever from the tax roll property which should be tax to pay for the city service subway improve land value without take away land freeway boost valuation less because the garage they require be not prime building by a long shoot and reduce the acreage that can be tax downtown los angeles be already two-third freeway interchange street park lot and garage one of those preposterous if statistics have already come to pass the freeway with narrowly space interchange concentrate and mitigate the access problem but it also act inevitably a an artificial isolate boundary city planner do not always use this boundary a effectively a they might less ambitious freeway plan may be more successful especially when the roadway and interchange be raise allow for cross access at many point and provide park area below the ramp meanwhile the automobile and it friend the truck have cost the central city some of it industrial dominance in ever great number factory be locate in the suburb or in industrial park remove from the city s political jurisdiction the appeal of the suburb be particularly strong for heavy industry which must move bulky object along a lengthy assembly line and want enough land area to do the entire job on one floor to light industry the economy of be on one floor be much slight but efficiency engineer usually believe in they and manufacturer look for way to cut cost can not be prevent from turn to efficiency engineer this movement of industry away from the central city be not so catastrophically new a some prophet seem to believe it be merely the late example of the leapfrog growth which form the pattern of virtually all american city the big factory which be relatively near the center of we city the rubber factory in akron chrysler s detroit plant we steel s pittsburgh work often begin on these site at a time when that be the edge of the city yet close to transport river storage pier and power river the leapfrog be a phenomenon of the railroad and the steam turbine and the time when the belt of residence surround the old factory area be not yet blight the truck and the car give the manufacturer a new degree of freedom in select he plant site until internal combustion become cheap he have to be near a railroad side and a trolley line or an exist large community of lower-class home the railroad side be still important it be usually though not always true that long-haul shipment by rail be cheap than truck but anybody who promise a substantial volume of business can get a railroad to run a short spur to he plant these day and many business can live without the railroad and there be now many millions of worker for whom the factory with the big park lot which can be reach by drive across or against the usual pattern of rush hour traffic and grille-route bus line be actually more convenient than the walk-to factory willow run general electric s enormous installation at louisville and syracuse the pentagon boe in seattle douglas and lockheed in los angeles the new automobile assembly plant everywhere none of these be substantially serve by any sort of conventional mass rapid transit they be all suburban plant rely on the road to keep they supply with worker and wherever the new thruways go up they bank be line by neat glass and metal and colore brick light industry the drive along massachusetts route 128 the by-pass which make an arc about twenty mile from downtown boston may be a vision of the future the future could be bad the plant along route 128 be mostly well design and nicely set against the new england rock and tree they can even be rather grand like edward land s monument to the astonish success of polaroid but they deny the value of the city the crowd competitive tolerant city the melt pot which give off so many of the most admirable american quality they be segregate business combine again on one site the factory and the office draw they work force from segregate community it be interest to note how many of the plant on massachusetts route 128 draw most of they income either from the government in non-competitive cost-plus arrangement or from the exploitation of patent which grant at least a partial monopoly while the factory be always the center of the labor market they be often on the city s periphery in spread the factory even far the automobile may not have change to any great extent the growth pattern of the city even the loss of hotel business to the outskirt s motel have be relatively painless the hotel-motel demarcation be become hard to find every year what hurt most be the damage the automobile have do to central-city retail especially in those city where public transit be feeble some retail of course always spread with the population grocery store drugstore local haberdashery and dress shop candy store and the like but whenever a major purchase be contemplate forty year ago a new bedroom set or a winter coat an easter bonnet a bicycle for junior the family set off for the downtown department store where the selection would be great department store congregate in the one hundred per cent location where all the transit line converge these store be still there but the volume of the downtown store have be on a relative decline while in many city the suburban branch sell more and more dry goods if the retailer and hotelman s downtown unit sales have be decrease however he dollar volume continue to rise and it be dollar which you put in the bank in most discussion of this phenomenon the figure be substantially inflate no suburban shopping-center branch not even hudson s vast northland outside detroit do anything like the unit volume of business or carry anything like the variety of merchandise to be find in the home store telephone order distort the picture the suburbanite naturally call a local rather than a central-city number if both be list in an advertisement especially if the local call eliminate city sales tax the suburban branch be thereby credit with a sale which would have be make even if it glass door have never open account procedure which continue to charge a disproportionate overhead and warehouse expense to the main store make the branch seem more profitable than they be in many case that statement we break even on we downtown operation and make money on we branch would be turn around if the cost analysis be recalculate on term less prejudicial to the old store fear of the competition always a great motivate force in the american economy make retailer who do not have suburban operation exaggerate both the volume and the profitability of they rival s shiny new branch the fact seem to be that very many large branch store be uneconomical that the choice of location in the suburb be a important a it be downtown and that even highly suburbanized city will support only so many big branch moreover the cost of operation be always high in any new store a the conservative banker who act a controller for retail giant be begin to discover when all have be say however the big branch store remain a major break with history in the development of american retail just a the suburban factory may be more convenient than the downtown plant to the worker with a car the trip to the shop center may seem far easy than to the downtown department store though both be the same distance from home indeed there be some city where the suburban shop pull customer who be geographically much near to downtown raymond vernon report that resident of east st louis have be drive across the mississippi through the heart of downtown st louis and out to the western suburb for major shop simply because park be easy at the big branch than it be in the heart of town to the extent that the problem be merely park an aggressive downtown management like that of lazarus brother in columbus ohio can fight back successfully by build a garage on the lot next door if the distant patron of the suburban branch have be frighten away from downtown by traffic problem however the city store can only pressure the politician to do something about the highway or await the completion of the federal highway program and if the affection for the suburban branch reflect a desire to shop with nice people rather than with the indiscriminate urban mass which support the downtown department store the central location may be in serious trouble today accord to land economist homer hoyt shop center and they associate park lot cover some 46000 acre of land which be almost exactly the total land area in all the nation s central business district put together the downtown store continue to offer the great inducement of variety both within it gate and across the street where other department store be immediately convenient for the shopper who want to see what be available before make up she mind if anything may be predict in the quicksilver world of retail it seem likely that the suburban branch will come to dominate child s clothing take the kid downtown be too much of a production household gadgetry and the discount business in big-ticket item department store be build on dry goods especially lady fashion and in this area in the long run the suburban branch will be hard put to compete against downtown if this analysis be correct the suburban branch will turn out to be what management s cost accountant refuse to acknowledge marginal operation rather than major factor historically in america the appeal of city have be they color and life the variety of experience they offer how you gon na keep em down on the farm be a question that have to be ask long before they see paree though american usually live in group segregate by national origin or religious belief they like to work and shop in the noise and vitality of downtown only a radical change in the nature of the population in the central city would be likely to destroy this preference and we must now turn we attention to the question of whether such a change gloomily foresee by so many urban diagnostician be actually upon we 4 suburb and negroes in they book american skyline christopher tunnard and henry hope reed argue that franklin roosevelt s new deal be what make the modern suburb a possibility a fine ironical argument when you consider how suburbanites tend to vote the first superhighway new york s henry hudson and chicago s lake shore san francisco s bay bridge and it approach a good slice of the pennsylvania turnpike be build a part of the federal work program which be go to cure the depression at the same time roosevelt s federal house administration couple with henry morgenthau s cheap-money policy permit ordinary lower-middle-class family to build they own home banker who have be reluctant to lend without good security than the house itself get that security from the we government householder who have be unable to pick up the burden of short-term high-interest mortgage find they could borrow for twenty-five year at 4 per cent under government aegis
