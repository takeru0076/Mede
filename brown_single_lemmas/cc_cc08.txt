have a funny experience at newport yesterday afternoon sit there and a a woman sing she keep get thin and thin right before i eye and the eye of some 5500 other people i make this observation about the lady miss judy garland because she bring up the subject herself in tell a story about a british female reporter who flatter she terribly in london recently and then write in the paper the next day judy garland have arrive in london she s not chubby she s not plump she s fat but who care when the lady sing certainly not the large afternoon audience newport have ever have at a jazz concert and the most attentive and quiet they applaud every number not only at it conclusion but also at the first statement of the theme sometimes at the first chord and judy sing the lovely old familiar thing which seem at time a bless relief from the way-out composition of the progressive jazzman who have dominate these proceeding thing like when you re smile almost like be in love do it again bear to wander alone together who care puttin on the ritz how long have this be go on and she own personal song like the man that get away and the inevitable over the rainbow miss garland be not only one of the great singer of we time but she be one of the superb showman at the start of she program there be evidence of pique she have hold to the letter of she contract and do nt come onto the stage until well after 4 pm the appoint hour although the music at newport people have try to get the program underway at 3 then there be a bad delay in get mort lindsey s 30-piece orchestra wedge into it chair along about 430 just when it be get to be about time to turn the audience over and toast they on the other side judy come on sing in a short-skirted blue dress with a blue and white jacket that flap in the wind she bouffant coiffure be fortunately comb on the leave which happen to be the direction from which a brisk breeze be blow in she first song she wave away one encroach photographer who dare approach the throne unbidden and thereafter the boy with the camera have to unsheathe they 300 mm lense and shoot at extreme range there also come a brief contretemps with the sound mixer who make the mistake of be overhear during a quiet moment near the conclusion of do it again and she make the tart observation that i never see so much move about in an audience but it do nt take judy garland showman long to realize that this sort of thing be par for the course at newport and that you have to learn to live with it before she chore be finish she be rescue wind-blown sheet of music trundle microphone about the stage help to move the piano and otherwise join in the informal atmosphere and time after time she really belt out she song sometimes they strike i a horribly over-arranged which be the way i feel about she come rain or come shine and sometimes they be just plain magnificent like she shatteringly beautiful beautiful weather to she partisan audience such picayune haggle would have seem nothing more than a critic strive to hold he franchise they just sit back on they haunch and cry for more a though they could never get enough they be reward with splendid exciting sing she rockabye you baby be a good a it can be do and she really personal song like the man that get away be deeply move the audience would nt let she leave until it have hear over the rainbow although the fellow that keep cry for get happy have to go home unhappy about that item anyway she be generous with she encore and the audience be equally so with it cheer and applause and flower all go home happy except the newport police who fear that the throng depart at 635 might meet head-on the night crowd draw nigh and those deprive of they happy hour at the cocktail bar in newport last night there be flash of distant lightning in the northern sky this be perhaps symbolic of the jazz of the even flash in the distance but no storm several time it come near break and there be in fact some lovely peal of thunder from jerry mulligan s big band which be about a fine an aggregation a have come along in the jazz business since john hammond find count basie work in a kansas city trap mulligan s band have be infect with he solid sense of swing and what it do seem far more meaningful than most of the noise generate by the big concert aggregation but what be equally impressive be the delicacy and wonderful lyric quality of both the band and mulligan s baritone sax in a fragile ballad like bob brookmeyer s arrangement of django s castle for subtle swing rhythm i could admire intensely mulligan s version of weep and the firework go on display in 18 carrot for robert a sax tribute to johnny hodges there be considerable contrast between this mulligan performance and that of art blakey and the jazz messenger who be able to generate a tremendous sound for such a small group unfortunately blakey do nt choose to work much of the time in this vein he prefer to have he soloist perform and thus we get only brief glimpse of what he ensemble work be like what we do get however be impressive a few drop of rain just before midnight when sarah vaughan be in the midst of she first number scatter the more timid member of the audience briefly but at this hour and with sarah on the stand most of the listener do nt care whether they get wet miss vaughan be back in top form somehow mellow and improve with the passage of time like a fine wine after the spate of female vocalist we have be have all of whom take sarah a a point of departure and then try to see what they could do that might make she seem old hat it seem that all that have happen be to make the real thing seem good than ever jazz three open program the even program be open by the jazz three a newport group consist of steve budieshein on bass jack warner drum and don cook piano this be a continuation of a good idea which be first try out saturday night when the eddie stack group also local talent go on first put on local musician at this place in the program serve a triple purpose it save the top flight jazz man from be waste in this unenviable spot when the audience be cold restless and in flux it prevent late-comer from miss some of the people they have come a long way to hear and it give the resident musician a chance to perform before the famous newport audience the jazz three display they sound musicianship not only in they own choose set but a the emergency accompanist for al minns & leon jame the superb jazz dancer who have now be newport performer for three successive year gradually move up from a morning seminar on the evolution of the blue to a spot on the even program julie wilson sing julie wilson a vigorous vocalist without many wild twist sing a set a large part of which consist of such seldom hear old oldies a hard-hearted hannah the vamp of savannah and the delightful sunday she frost the cake with the always reliable bill bailey from this taste of the 1920s we leap way out to stan getz s private brand of progressive jazz which do lovely subtle thing for bauble bangle and bead and a couple of ballard getz be a difficult musician to categorize he play he sax principally for beauty of tone rather than for scintillating flight of meaningless improvisation and he have a quiet way of get back and restate the melody after the improvise be over in this he be stick with tradition however far remove from it he may seem to be shear take over george shear take over with he well discipline group a sextet consist of vibe guitar bass drum shear s piano and a bongo drummer he meet with enthusiastic audience approval especially when he swing from jazz to latin american thing like the mambo shear himself seem to i to be play good piano than in he recent newport appearance a very casual pleasant program one of those easy-going thing that make newport s afternoon program such a relax delight be hold again under sunny sky hot sun and a fresh breeze for an audience of at least a couple of thousands who come to newport to hear music rather than go to the beach divide almost equally into two part it consist of the evolution of the blue narrate by jon hendrick who have present it last year at the monterey calif jazz festival and an hour-long session of maynard ferguson and he orchestra a blast big band hendrick story be design for child and he have a small audience

extremely talent young man do a slave auctioneer s call a field-hands work song and a beautifully sing negro lullaby brown baby which be one of the truly move moment of the festival one of those delightful surprise addition which so frequently occur in jazz program be an excellent stint at the drum by the great joe jones drum to old man river which seem to have be elect the favorite solo for the boy on the batterie at this year s concert demonstrate the primitive african rhythmic background of the blue be michael babatunde olatunji who play such native drum a the konga and even do a
