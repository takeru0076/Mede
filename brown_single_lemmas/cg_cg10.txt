the north and the south be in great agreement on sovereignty through all they dispute about it than be the found father the truth in they conflict concept be expound by statesman of the calibre of webster and calhoun and defend in the end by leader of the nobility of lincoln and lee the people everywhere have grow meanwhile in devotion to basic democratic principle in understand of and belief in the federal balance and in love of they union repeat effort begin with the missouri compromise of 1821 be make by such master moderate a clay and douglas to resolve the difference peacefully by compromise rather than clear think and timely action even so confusion in this period gain such strength from compromise and other factor that it lead to the bloody war of the nineteenth century nothing can show more than this the immensity of the danger to democratic people that lie in even relatively slight deviation from they true concept of sovereignty the present issue in atlantica whether to transform an alliance of sovereign nation into a federal union of sovereign citizen resemble the american one of 1787-89 rather than the one that be resolve by civil war and so i would only touch upon it now much a i have long want to write a book about it i think it be essential however to pinpoint here the difference between the two concept of sovereignty that go to war in 1861 if only to see good how imperative be we need today to clarify completely we far bad confusion on this subject the difference come down to this the southern state insist that the unite state be in last analysis what it name imply a union of state to they leader the constitution be a compact make by the people of sovereign state who therefore retain the right to secede from it this right of the state it upholder contend be essential to maintain the federal balance and protect the liberty of the people from the danger of centralize power in the union government the champion of the union maintain that the constitution have form fundamentally the unite people of america that it be a compact among sovereign citizen rather than state and that therefore the state have no right to secede though the citizen could write to speed on august 24 1855 lincoln make the latter point clear in homely term whose timeliness be startle today he thus declare he own right to secede we begin by declare that all man be create equal we now practically read it all man be create equal except negroes when the know-nothing get control it will read all man be create equal except negroes and foreigner and catholic when it come to this i shall prefer emigrate to some country where they make no pretence of love liberty to russia for instance where despotism can be take pure without the base alloy of hypocrisy he emphasis when the southern state exercise they right to secede they form what they officially style the confederate state of america dictionary a we have see still cite this government along with the article of confederation of 1781 a an example of a confederacy the fact be that the southern confederacy differ from the early one almost a much a the federal constitution do the confederate constitution copy much of the federal constitution verbatim and most of the rest in substance it operate on by and for the people individually just a do the federal constitution it make substantially the same division of power between the central and state government and among the executive legislative and judicial branch the difference between confederacy and federal union in 1861 many believe and understandably that the great difference between the constitution of the southern confederacy and the federal constitution be that the former recognize the right of each state to secede but though each of it member have assert this right against the union the final constitution which the confederacy sign on march 11 nearly a month before hostility begin include no explicit provision authorize a state to secede it drafter discuss this vital point but leave it out of they constitution they president jefferson davis interpret they constitution to mean that it admit of no coerce association but this remain so doubtful that there be frequent demand that the right to secede be put into the constitution the constitution of the southern confederation differ from that of the federal union only in two important respect it openly defiantly recognize slavery an institution which the southerner of 1787 even though they continue it find so impossible to reconcile with freedom that they carefully avoid mention the word in the federal constitution they recognize that slavery be a moral issue and not merely an economic interest and that to recognize it explicitly in they constitution would be in explosive contradiction to the concept of sovereignty they have set forth in the declaration of 1776 that all man be create equal that they be endow by they creator with certain unalienable right that among they be life liberty and the pursuit of happiness the other important difference between the two constitution be that the president of the confederacy hold office for six instead of four year and be limit to one term these be not however difference in federal structure the only important difference from that standpoint between the two constitution lie in they preamble the one of 1861 make clear that in make they government the people be act through they state whereas the preamble of 1787-89 express a clearly a language can the opposite concept that they be act directly a citizen here be the two preamble federal constitution 1789 we the people of the unite state in order to form a more perfect union establish justice insure domestic tranquility provide for the common defence promote the general welfare and secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and we posterity do ordain and establish this constitution for the unite state of america confederate constitution 1861 we the people of the confederate state each state act in it sovereign and independent character in order to form a permanent federal government establish justice insure domestic tranquility and secure the blessing of liberty to ourselves and we posterity invoke the favor and the guidance of almighty god do ordain and establish this constitution for the confederate state of america one be tempt to say that on the difference between the concept of sovereignty in these two preamble the bad war of the nineteenth century be fight but though the southern state when draft a constitution to unite themselves narrow the difference to this fine point by omit to assert the right to secede the fact remain that by secede from the union they have already act on the concept that it be compose primarily of sovereign state if the union concede this to they the same right must be concede to each remain state whenever it see fit to secede this would destroy the federal balance between it and the state and in the end sacrifice to the sovereignty of the state all the liberty the citizen have gain by they union lincoln see that the act of secession make the issue for the union a vital one whether it be a union of sovereign citizen that should continue to live or an association of sovereign state that must fall prey either to anarchy or despotism much a he abhor slavery lincoln be always will to concede to each slave state the right to decide independently whether to continue or end it though he election be interpret by many southerner a the forerunner of a dangerous shift in the federal balance in favor of the union lincoln himself propose no such change in the right the constitution give the state after the war begin he long refuse to permit emancipation of the slave by union action even in the border state that stay with the union he issue he emancipation proclamation only when he feel that necessity leave he no other way to save the union in he message of december 2 1862 he put he purpose and he policy in these word which i would call the lincoln law of liberty-and-union in give freedom to the slave we assure freedom to the free what lincoln could not concede be that the state rather than the people be sovereign in the union he fight to the end to preserve it a a government of the people by the people for the people the truth on each side win in the civil war the fact that the american who upheld the sovereignty of they state do this in order to keep many of they people more securely in slavery the antithesis of individual liberty make the conflict grim and the great out of this ordeal the citizen emerge in the south a in the north a america s true sovereign in a new birth of freedom a lincoln promise but before this come about 214938 american have give they life in battle for the two concept of the sovereign right of man and of state on they decisive battlefield lincoln do not distinguish between they when he pay tribute to the brave man live and dead who fight here he understand that both side be at fault and he reach the height of say so explicitly in he second inaugural to i knowledge lincoln remain the only head of state and commander-in-chief who while fight a fearful war whose issue be in doubt prove man enough to say this publicly to give he foe the benefit of the fact that in all human truth there be some error and in all we error some truth so great a man could not but understand too that the thing that move man to sacrifice they life be not the error of they think which they opponent see and attack but the truth which the latter do not see any more than they see the error which mar the truth they themselves defend it be much less difficult now than in lincoln s day to see that on both side sovereign american have give they life in the civil war to maintain the balance between the power they have delegate to the state and to they union they differ in the balance they believe essential to the sovereignty of the citizen but the supreme sacrifice each make serve to maintain a still more fundamental truth that individual life liberty and happiness depend on a right balance between the two and on the limitation of sovereignty in all it aspect which this involve the 140414 american who give the last full measure of devotion to prevent disunion preserve individual freedom in the unite state from the danger of anarchy inherent in confederation which throughout history have prove fatal in the end to all association compose primarily of sovereign state and to the liberty of they people but the fact that 70524 other american give the same measure of devotion to an oppose concept serve liberty-and-union in other essential way it appeal from ballot to bullet at fort sumter end by cost the southerner they right to have slave a right that be even less compatible with the sovereignty of man the very fact that they come so near to win by the wrong method war lead directly to they lose both the war and the wrong thing they fight for since it force lincoln to free they slave a a military measure there be a divine justice in one wrong thus undo another there be also a lesson one that have serve ever since to keep american in they conflict with one another from turn from the ballot to the bullet yet though the southern state lose the bad error in they case they do not lose the truth they fight for the life so many of they give to forestall what they believe would be a fatal encroachment by the union on the power reserve to they state have continue ever since to safeguard all american against freedom s other foe
