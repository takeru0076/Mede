suddenly however they posture change and the game end they go a rigid a black statuary six figure lean and tall and angular go still they head be in the air sniff they all swing at the same instant in the same direction they see it before i do even with i binoculars it be nothing more than a tiny distant rain squall a dull gray sheet which reach from a layer of cloud to the earth in the 360 degree of horizon it obscure only a degree no more a white man would not have see it the aborigine fasten upon it with a concentration beyond pathos watch they wait until the squall thicken and begin to move in a long drift slant across the dry burn land at once the whole band set off at a lope they be chase a rain cloud they go after the squall a mercilessly a a wolf pack after an abandon cow i follow they in the jeep and now they do not care the game be over this be life occasionally for no reason that i could see they would suddenly alter the angle of they trot sometimes i guess it be because the rain squall have change direction sometimes it be to skirt a gulley they gait be impossible to convey in word it have nothing of the proud stride of the train runner about it it be not a lope it be not do with style or verve it be the gait of the human who must run to live arm dangle leg barely swing over the ground head hang down and only occasionally swing up to see the target a loose motion that be just short of stumble and yet be wonderfully graceful it be a barely control skim of the ground they run for three hour finally avoid hummock and seek low ground they intercept the rain squall for ten minute they run beneath the squall raise they arm and for the first time shout and caper then the wind die and the rain squall hold steady they be study the ground suddenly one of they shout run a few foot bend forward and put he mouth to the ground he have find a depression with rain water in it he bend down a black cranelike figure and put he mouth to the ground with a lordly and generous gesture the discoverer stand up and beckon to the close of he fellow the other trot over and swoop at the tiny puddle in an instant he have suck it dry the aborigine life on the cruel land i have ever see which do not mean that it be ugly part of it be of course there be thousands of square mile of salt pan which be hideous they be huge area which have be sweep by wind for so many century that there be no soil leave but only deep bare ridge fifty or sixty yard apart with ravine between they thirty or forty foot deep and the only thing that move be a scuttle layer of sand such stretch have an inhuman moonlike quality but much of the land which the aborigine wander look a if it should be hospitable it be soften by the saltbush and the bluebush have a peaceful quality the hill roll softly the malignancy of such a landscape have be beautifully describe by the australian charles bean he tell of three man who start out on a trip across a single paddock a ten-by-ten-mile square own by a sheep grazer they go well-equipped with everything except knowledge of the outback country the countryside look like a beautiful open park with gentle slope and soft gray tree-clumps nothing appal or horrible rush upon these man only there happen nothing there might have be a pool of cool water behind any of these tree-clumps only there be not it might have rain any time only it do not there might have be a fence or a house just over the next rise only there be not they lie with the bird hop from branch to branch above they and the bright sky peep down at they no one come the white man die and countless other like they have die even today range rider will come upon mummify body of man who attempt nothing more difficult than a twenty-mile hike and slowly lose direction be torture by the heat drive mad by the constant and unfulfilled promise of the landscape and who finally die the aborigine be not deceive he know that the land be hard and pitiless he know that the economy of life in the outback be awful there be no room for error or waste any organism that falter or misperceives the signal or weaken be do i do not know if such a way of life can come to be a self-conscious challenge but i suspect that it can perhaps this be what give the aborigine he odd air of dignity the family at the boulder see an aborigine today be a difficult thing many of they have drift into the city and town and seaport other be confine to vast reservation and not only do the australian government justifiably not wish they to be view a exhibit in a zoo but on they reservation they be extremely fugitive shun camp come together only for corroboree at which they strange culture come to it high pitch which be very low indeed i persuade an australian friend who have live outback for year to take i to see some aborigine live in the bush it be a difficult and ambiguous kind of negotiation even though the rancher be say to be expert in he knowledge of the aborigine and they language finally however the arrangement be make and we drive out into the bush in a land rover we follow the asphalt road for a few mile and then swing off onto a small road which be nothing more than two tire mark on the earth the rancher go a mile down this road and then when he reach a big red boulder swing off the road at once he start to glance toward the instrument panel it take i a moment to realize what be odd about that panel there be a gimbaled compass weld to it which rock gently back and forth a the land rover bounce about the rancher be navigate he way across the flatland do you always navigate like this i ask damn right he say once i get out on the flat i do some chap that know an area well can make they way by landmark a tree here a wash here a boulder there but if you do nt know the place like the palm of you hand you d good use a compass and the speedometer two mile northeast then five mile southwest that sort of thing very simple he be right the landscape keep repeat itself i would try to memorize landmark and see in a half-hour that it be hopeless finally we approach the bivouac of the aborigine they be camp beside a large column-shaped boulder a man he lubra and two child the sun be not yet high and all of they be in the small area of shade cast by the boulder there be also a dog a dingo dog it rib show it be a yellow nondescript color it suffer from a variety of sore hair have scab off it body in patch it lie with it head on it paw and only it eye move watch we carefully it strike i a a very bright and very malnourished dog no one pat the dog it be not a pet it be a worker the bugger love shade the rancher say i suppose because it save they some loss of body water they ll move around that rock all day follow the shade during the hot part of the day of course the sun come straight down and there be nt any shade we drive close to the boulder stop the land rover and walk over toward the family the man be lean against the rock he gaze away from we a we approach he be over six foot tall and very thin he leg be narrow and very long every bone and muscle in he body show but he do not give the appearance of starve he have long black hair and a wispy beard the ridge over he eye be huge and he eyelid be half shut there be something about he face that disturb i and it take several second to realize what it be not merely that fly be crawl over he face but he narrow eyelid do not blink when the fly crawl into he eye socket a fly would crawl down the bulge forehead into the socket of the eye walk along the man s lash and across the wet surface of the eyeball and the eye do not blink the australian and i both be wear insect repellent and be not badly bother by insect but i eye water a we stand watch the aborigine i turn to look at the lubra she remain squat on she heel all the time we be there like the man she be entirely naked she long thin arm move in a slow rhythmical gesture over the family possession which be place in front of she there be two rub stick for make fire two stone shape roughly like knife a woven-root container which hold a few pound of dry worm and the dead body of some rodent there be also a long wooden spear and a woomera a spear-throwing device which give the spear an enormous velocity and high accuracy there be also a boomerang elaborately carve everything be burnish with sweat and grease so that all of the object seem to have be carve from the same material and to be ageless the two child both boy wander around the australian and i for a few moment and then return to they work they squat on they heel with they head bend far forward they eye only a few inch from the ground they have locate the runway of a colony of ant and a the ant come out of the ground the boy pick they up one at a time and pinch they dead the tiny body drop onto a dry leaf make a pile a big a a small apple the odor here be more powerful than that which surround the town aborigine the smell at first be more surprise than unpleasant it be also subtly familiar for it be the odor of the human body but multiply innumerable time because of the fact that the aborigine never bathe one s impulse be to say that the smell be a stink and unpleasant but that be a cliche and a dishonest one the smell be sexual but so powerfully so that a civilize nose must deny it they skin be cover with a thin coat of sweat and dirt which have almost the consistency of a second skin they roll at night in ash to keep warm and they second skin have a light dusty cast to it in spot such a the elbow and knee the second skin be wear off and i realize the aborigine be much dark than they appear a if the coat of sweat dirt and ash be a cosmetic the boy have beautiful dark eye and unlike they father they brush constantly at the fly and blink they eye that smell be something eh mate the australian ask they swear that every person smell different and every family smell different from every other at the corroboree when they get to dance and sweat you ll see they rub up against a man who s suppose to have a specially good smell idje here and he nod at the man be say to have great odor the stink be all the same to i but i really think they can make one another out blindfold here idje you fella like tabac he say sharply idje still stare over we shoulder at the horizon the australian stop try to talk a pidgin i could understand and speak strange word from deep in he chest
