there come a time in the life of most of we when we want to be alone not necessarily to be off all by ourselves but away from the crowd and common happenstance if you ve travel in europe a time or two it be quite certain that you ve have that wanting-to-be-alone feel or that you will get it on you next visit across the atlantic follow a guide and gratefully so be an excellent way to see all the important place when everything be strange and new however after you ve see all the historical piazza and plaza the place and forum the church and museum the palace and castle and begin to feel at home in the capital of europe you ll want to change you course and follow the by-road at will far from the market place the champagne at troye the traditional capital of the champagne country have more ambrosial taste somehow than it have at a sidewalk cafe on the rue de la paix or at tour dargent you can relive history and follow in fancy the crusader in they quest for the holy grail a they sail out from brindisi an ancient town in the heel of italy s boot and you do nt meet the folk from home in northwest spain which have remain almost untouched by time and tourist since the middle age time stand still a you climb the narrow stone stairway in tiny village cling to steep mountain slope or wander through story-book town perch atop lofty crag they face turn to the sea they ve be there since the day of the moor and the saracen and what good way to end a day than by dine with artist and gourmet in a squat but charm fisherman s village on the mediterranean an almost too-simple-to-be-true way to set forth on such adventure be just to put yourself behind the wheel of a car and head for the open road for those who need or want and can afford another car buy one and drive it on the grand tour then ship it home be one popular plan for a do-it-yourself pilgrimage then of course there be those of we who either do not want or need or can not afford another car the answer to this diathesis be to pick up a telephone and arrange to rent one it be that elemental almost any travel agent will reserve a car for you you can call one of the car rental service directly hertz avis auto-europe nationalcar rental and other and ask they to reserve a car of you choice and some transportation line offer this service a well with few exception you car will be wait for you at dockside airport railroad station or hotel when you arrive oftentimes at no additional cost you can wait of course until you arrive in europe before rent you car the disadvantage to this method be that you may not have a great a choice of model readily available or you may have to wait a few day or during the busy tourist season when car be in great demand you might find it fairly difficult to get a car at all since charge be relatively the same reserve a car before you leave for europe will assure you of have one on tap when you want it for those who plan to travel to europe by one route and return by another some agency offer a service whereby you can pick up a car in one city on arrival and leave it in another city or even another country when you be ready to return home at some

insurance there be a small additional charge again vary from country to country and depend on the term of such insurance the average charge for this additional insurance coverage be roughly $ 100 a day the charge be variable however and go a low a $ 50 a day in ireland and a high a $ 200 a day in greece rental fee be variable too throughout the country of europe there be a many rate a there be country and model of car available a in the unite state there be a flat fee-per-day rental charge plus a few cent per kilometer drive and the per-day rate drop if the car be retain for a week it drop again after fifteen and twenty-one day it be well to bear in mind that gasoline will cost from $ 80 to $ 90 for the equivalent of a unite state gallon and while you might prefer a familiar ford chevrolet or even a cadillac which be available in some country it be probably wise to choose the small european make which average thirty thirty-five and even forty mile to the gallon you choice of model will undoubtedly be govern by the number of people travel in you group with the exception of the sport car even the quite tiny sedan will seat four passenger if you be will to sacrifice comfort and luggage space for really economical transportation there be a large variety of model to choose from in most country however include 6-passenger sedan and station wagon and the rental fee be nt all that much great than for the we sedan the basic cost be generally pretty much the same regardless of the agency through which you reserve you car but some of they offer supplementary advantage there be the free intra-city rent it here leave it there service a an example the free delivery and collection at the airport dockside or you hotel luggage rack tour document and information and other similar service a little investigation by telephone or read the travel ad in the newspaper and magazine will give you these pertinent detail on the additional money-saving benefit the investigation will be well worth you time all model car be not available in all country quite naturally there be a great availability of those model which be manufacture within a specific country if you would like to start you tour in italy where the rental fee be actually the low in europe fiat in all size be available a be alfa romeo giulietta model if you wish to budget closely on transportation save you extra dollar to indulge in luxury one agency list the small fiat 500 at only $ 126 a day plus $ 03 a kilometer and the fiat 2100 station wagon seat six at just $ 110 a day and $ 105 a kilometer if you will be use you car more than fifteen day which be nt all unlikely the daily rate drop quite sharply to $ 86 a day for the fiat 500 and to an infinitesimal $ 30 a day for the fiat 2100 station wagon with six in the group the cost come to just a nickel a day per person on the daily fee in the majority of country however the rate range from $ 300 to $ 350 a day for the small sedan and graduate up to $ 700 and $ 800 a day for the large luxury european model with the rate per kilometer drive start at $ 03 and go up a high a $ 12 the same model car might be available in six or eight country yet not two country will have the same rate either for the daily rate or rate per kilometer drive the variation be not too great rate for american car be somewhat high range from about $ 800 a day up to $ 1400 a day for a chevrolet convertible but the rate per kilometer drive be roughly the same a for the large european model rate in greece and finland be fairly high actually the high in europe and surprisingly enough they be also quite high in ireland if you be plan to tour europe for long than a month it might be wise for you to lease a car the actual over-all cost for the first month will perhaps not be too much low than the rental charge for the same period of time but you will receive a new car you will be entitle to all the advantage of a new car owner which include the factory guarantee and the service valid at authorize dealer throughout europe far there be no mileage charge or mileage limitation when you lease a car and you pay only the flat monthly rate plus a nominal charge for document and insurance since the car be register and insure individually for you trip there be a fairly wide selection of model of english german and french manufacture from which you can choose from the very small austin 7 citroen 2 cv volkswagens renaults to the 6-passenger simca beaulieu lease a car be not a common or a popular a rent a car in europe but for long period it will be unquestionably more economical and satisfactory after the first month rate be considerably less average only about $ 60 a month for most 4 - and 5-passenger model there be reason for some people not want to rent car and go on the do-it-yourself plan for one thing the driver usually see less and have less fun than he passenger since it become pretty necessary for he to keep at least one eye on the road then too european driver have reputation for be somewhat crazy on the road and some american be not particularly keen on get mix up with they still there be a way for those who want to see some of the back country of europe by car the way be to rent a chauffeur-driven car it be nt a expensive a most people believe it to be you chauffeur s expense will average between $ 700 to $ 1200 a day but this charge be the same whether you rent a 7-passenger cadillac limousine or a 4-passenger peugeot or fiat 1800 the big spread be in the charge for each kilometer drive be govern by the rate at which gasoline be consume since most european car average more mile per gallon of gasoline than american car it naturally follow that the cost per kilometer for these model will be less but the great seat capacity of the large american car will equalize this provide you group be sufficiently large to fill a 7-passenger limousine the fee for the rental of chauffeur-driven car vary in the different country in the same manner a they do for the drive-yourself car however whether you arrange to have a european or american model if you rent a car with the proper seat capacity in relation to the number of people in you party you transportation expense will average very close to $ 1000 per day per passenger this will include you helpful english-speaking chauffeur and a drive of an average of 150 kilometer in any one day if you drive great distance than that you ll just be skim the surface and will never discover the enchantment fascination and beauty which lure you in the first place to explore the hinterland of course if you want to throw all caution to the wind and rent an imperial or cadillac limousine just for you and you bride you ll have a memorable tour but it will nt be cheap and it be not recommend unless you own a produce oil well or you ve have a winner in the irish sweepstake
