there be so i biologist friend tell i mechanism of adaptation and defense that be just too complete and too satisfactory mollusks be a case in point the shell which serve the strain so well at a relatively early stage in the evolutionary scheme tend to cancel out the possibility of future development though this may or may not be good biology it do aptly illustrate the strength and the weakness of american catholic high education there can be no doubt that the american catholic accomplishment in the field of high education be most impressive we european brother never cease to marvel at the number and the size of we college and university the deep wonder be how this miracle be accomplish in decade rather than in century and by immigrant minority at that by way of explanation we ourselves be prone to imagine that this achievement stem from the same american catholic zeal and generosity which bring the parochial school system into existence there be however one curious discrepancy in this broad and flatter picture view the american catholic educational achievement in retrospect we may indeed see it a a unify whole extend from grade school to university but the simple truth be that high education have never really be an official american catholic project certainly not in the same sense that the establishment of a parochial school system have be a matter of official policy official encouragement be one thing but the down-to-earth test be the allocation of diocesan and parochial fund american catholic have respond generously to bishop and pastor appeal for the support necessary to create parochial school but they have not contribute in a similar fashion to the establishment of institution of high learn they have not do so for the simple reason that such appeal have hardly ever be make diocesan authority generally have not regard this a they direct responsibility all of this may be understandable enough it be however in fact difficult to see how diocesan authority could have act otherwise yet for good or for bad the truth of the matter be that most american catholic college do not owe they existence to general catholic support but rather to the initiative resourcefulness and sacrifice of individual religious community community esprit de corps have be the protective shell which have make the achievement possible to understand the past history and the future potential of american catholic high education it be necessary to appreciate the special character of the esprit de corps of the religious community it be something more than the arithmetical sum of individual total of piety and detachment a religious community with a vital sense of mission achieve a degree of group orientation and group identification seldom find elsewhere the fact that the group orientation and group identification be found on supernatural principle and nourish by the well-spring of devotion simply give they a deep and more satisfy dimension the net result be a uniquely satisfy sense of comradeship the kind of comradeship which spark enthusiasm and blunt the cut edge of sacrifice and hardship american catholic college and university be in a very real sense the product of private enterprise the private enterprise of religious community have it not be for such private enterprise diocesan authority might of course have be goad into establish institution subsidize by diocesan fund and parish collection and staff by religious a pay employee there be however no point in speculate about such a possibility the fact of the matter be that we institution of high learn owe they existence to a spirit not unlike that which produce the family business this family-community spirit be the real explanation of the marvel of we achievement it be this spirit which explain some of the anomaly of american catholic high education in particular the wasteful duplication apparent in some area i think for example of three woman s college with pitifully small enrollments cluster within a few mile of a major catholic university which be also co-educational this be not an isolate example this aspect of the total picture have be comment upon often enough it would seem to represent esprit de corps run riot apart however from the question of wasteful duplication there be another aspect of the family business spirit in american catholic high education which deserve close scrutiny for while the past need of the church in this country may have be adequately meet by collegiate institution which in temper and tone closely resemble junior college and finish school it would seem that today s need be for the college which more closely resemble the university in it pursuit of excellence at the early pre-academic excellence stage of catholic education the operation could be conduct on an intra-mural community basis but with today s demand for professional qualification and specialize train the need for outsider become more press the problem be not merely that more outside teacher be need but that a different brand be call for comment on the early stage the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professor in a recent report on the question of faculty participation in administrative decision-making note that the term teacher-employee a oppose to eg maintenance employee be a not inapt description today however the outsider be likely to have professional qualification of the high order otherwise the college would not be interest in hire he and to be acclimatize to the democratic process of the secular or state university and while no one expect total democracy on the academic scene the scholar will be particularly sensitive to a line between first and second class citizenship draw on any basis other than that of academic rank or professional achievement in the above mention report of the notre dame chapter of the american association of university professor the basic outlook of the new breed of lie faculty emerge very clearly in the very statement of the problem a the member see it even with the good of intention he the president of the university be loath to delegate such authority and responsibility to a group the membership of which consider a it must be by he in individual term be inhomogeneous mortal and of extremely vary temperament interest and capability it be natural that he should turn for he major support to a select and dedicate few from the organization which actually own the university and whose goal be in they opinion identify with it high good and to use that oft-repeated phrase the attainment of excellence the pattern here picture be clearly not peculiar to notre dame it be simply that the paradox involve in this kind of control of the institution by the organization which actually own it become more obvious where there be a large and more distinguish outside faculty it be particularly interest that those who frame the report should refer to the organization which actually own the university this seem to show an awareness of the fact that there be more to the problem than the ordinary issue of clerical-lay tension but in any case one do not have to read very closely between the line to realize that the situation be not regard a a particularly happy one outside faculty member want to be consider partner in the academic enterprise and not merely pay employee of a family business there be two reason why failure to come to grip with this demand could be fatal to the future of the catholic university in the first place there be the obvious problem of recruit high caliber personnel word spread rapidly in the tightly knit academic profession much give to attend meeting and conference expression of even low-key dissatisfaction by a catholic college faculty member have the effect of confirm the already exist stereotype in the academic world there be seldom anything so dramatic a a strike or a boycott all that happen be that the good qualify teacher decline to gamble two or three year of he life on the chance that condition at the catholic institution will be a good a those elsewhere to appreciate the nature of the gamble it should be realize that while college teach be almost a public symbol of security that security do not come a quickly or a automatically a it do in an elementary school system or in the civil service much have be make of the fact that major catholic institution now guarantee firm tenure this be a significant advance but it import should not be exaggerate when a man invest a block of he year at a university without gain the covete promotion not only be he face with the problem of start over but there be also a certain depreciation in the market value of he service a man do not make that kind of gamble if he suspect that one or more of the limit number of tenure position be be reserve for member of the family just a it be possible to exaggerate the draw power of the new tenure practice it be also possible to exaggerate the significance of the now relatively adequate salary pay by major catholic institution adequate compensation be indispensable yet adequate compensation and particularly merely adequate compensation be no substitute for those intangible which cause a man to sacrifice part of he earn potential by take up college teach in the first place broadly speak the total catholic atmosphere be such an intangible but the large demand be for a sense of creative participation and mature responsibility in the total work of the university religious who derive they own sense of purpose through identification with the religious community rather than the academic community be prone to underestimate both the layman s reservoir of idealism and he need for this identification there be no need here to spell out the condition of creative teach except to point out that at the college level the sense of community and of community responsibility be even more necessary than it be at other level the college teacher need the stimulus of communication with other faculty member but he also need to feel that such communication even informal debate over the luncheon table be a contribution to the total good of the institution but this in turn mean that decision be not merely impose from the top but that there be some actual mechanism of faculty participation the second reason for be concern with the dichotomy between faculty member who be part of the in-group that own and operate the institution and those who be merely pay employee be therefore the baneful effect on the caliber of the teach itself this be a problem that go considerably beyond question of salary and tenure yet though it may seem difficult to envision any definitive resolution of the problem of ownership and control there be nevertheless certain suggestion which seem to be in order the first be a negative warn there be no point in the creation of faculty committee and advisory board with high-sounding title but no real authority in the case of academic personnel the feel of participation can hardly be fake competent teacher be well verse in the technique of lead student to pre-set conclusion without destroy the student illusion that they be make they own decision those who have serve a faculty adviser be too familiar with the useful but artificial mechanism of student government to be take in by busy-work and ersatz decision make in any case it be by no mean clear that formally structure organ of participation be what be call for at all in the notre dame report reference be make to the fact that faculty member be reduce to luncheon-table communication in itself there be nothing wrong with this form of participation the only difficulty on the catholic campus be that those faculty member who be in a position to implement policy ie member of the religious community which own and administer the institution have they own eat arrangement
