you could run a nursery of you own for work mother eugenia say we could put up crib on the second floor sleep porch and turn the front bedroom into a playroom where it s nice and sunny but of course it would entail quite a bit of run up and down stairs and chris say you be to be careful about that what else you might set up a dress shop in the live room every woman in the block have try that what about a tea room then you could set up table in the front room and serve salad and you bake bean and word bread and grandma could dress like a gypsy and tell fortune it s too elaborate and grandma be nt strong enough to take on something like that and to tell you the truth neither be i eugenia sigh she say well those be the really interest thing but if you do nt like any of those i can turn over

over the mile high city lock it in an icy grip that harshened it outline and alter it physical appearance it have a look of grim stark realism resemble other city whose habitual climate be cold instead of the sprawl bumptious open-handed greedy western city bask in eternal sunshine at the foot of mountain store with endless riches and resource the jobless huddle in the street outside of employment office outside newspaper building in park in relief line outside government agency there be nt facility to take care of they there never have be a need feel for such facility that kind of poverty be regard a the exclusive property of the east which create depression with they stock market and they congest population and they greedy centralization of industry protect by discriminatory freight rate the east be popularly suppose to have get the country into war and into depression drag the west along and now the east be create government agency for which the west doubtless would have to pay the government office be be open but they be nt be open fast enough and meanwhile the cold penetrate everything shiver people talk and argue all this government spend would have to be pay for somehow but on the other hand desperate circumstance call for desperate remedy and something have to be do something have to be do it be the theme song of millions of american people they personal

he be term a major disaster the abernathy furnace consume fuel like a giant ravenous maw that have to be appease by hurl ton of coal into it evil red depth and no matter how much coal they put in the house remain cold cold come in the innumerable crack that seem to have spring up under door around loosen window frame from the sleep porch the attic from the widen crack between shingles on the roof presently they have to give up run the furnace at full capacity and depend on the old coal range in the kitchen which have never be remove when the new gas range be install and the fireplace and an electric heater in grandma s room it be so cold and so wretched that a sort of desperate gaiety infect all of they like people stormbound or shipwreck or catch in some other freak of circumstance so that time stand still and minor anxiety fall away and the only important thing be to cling together and survive the pipe burst and they all laugh and stand in ice water to they ankle while they swab the bathroom they live mainly in the kitchen they move maggie s bed and the baby s basket there and the rest of they undress by the stove and run groan and shiver to the upper polar region and plunge into icy bed grandma say it be just like the early mine camp day and it be the way people ought to live only she be get too old to take the pleasure from it that she use to you say a mouthful eugenia say grimly eugenia hate be cold bad than anything and she be begin to find the joy of poverty wear thin she say to maggie that it be one thing to meet an emergency and another to wallow in it and it be begin to look at if this one be go to last forever plenty of people be poor all they life plenty of people have nt we brain and talent i know you when you start talk about brain and talent maggie say you re work up to something and if you do nt watch out you ll ruin you whole life one of these day just to prove that the abernathy family be superior to everything even a depression the only
