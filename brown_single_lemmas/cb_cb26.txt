tenure a criterion i would like to add one more practical reform to those mention by russell kirk dec 16 it have to do with teacher salary and tenure next september after receive a degree from yale s master of art in teach program i will be teach somewhere that much be guarantee by the present shortage of mathematics teacher i will also be underpay the amaze thing be that this too be cause by the dearth of teacher teach be at present a seller market a a result buyer the public must be satisfy with second-rate teacher but this be not the real problem the rub arise from the fact that teacher be usually pay on the basis of time serve rather than quality hence all teacher good and bad who have be teach for a give number of year be pay the same salary i be firmly convince that consider the average quality of teacher in this country the profession be grossly overpay it follow that teacher a a group can not expect any mark salary increase there be a limit to how much the public will pay for shoddy performance the only hope which good teacher have for be pay they due be to stop drag the dead weight of poor teacher up the economic ladder with they the only hope which the public have for get good teacher be to pay teacher on the basis of merit rather than tenure here a in all sector of the economy quality and justice be both dependent on the right of the individual to deal directly with he employer if he so choose loss of initiative on the eve of the great debate on the proposal to give the president broad power to make across-the-board tariff concession which could practically bring we into the atlantic community we should face the alternative on this proposition what we will be sacrifice in any such arrangement will be we power to be selective which be contain in the reciprocal trade principle under which we now operate without this power we lie open any american industry which the european may find it economically profitable to destroy to the will of other it be this loss of initiative in how we conduct we economy which may lead to the loss of initiative in how we conduct we political affair a brief for the negative i disagree with mr burnham s position on the common market nov 18 a a desirable organization for we to join for he to ignore the political consequence involve in an atlantic union of this kind be difficult to understand the pressure for we entry to the common market be mount and we will proceed towards this amalgamate trade union by way of a purely economic thoroughfare or garden path with the political ramification keep neatly in the background the appeal be go to be to the pocketbook and may be very convince to those who do not see it relation to political and legal a well a economic self-rule in enter this union we will be surrender most if not all of we economic autonomy to international body such a the atlantic institute recently set up or the oecd imf and other to think that we can merely relinquish we economic autonomy without give up we political or legal autonomy be wishful think if it be not enough that all of we internationalist one worlder be advocate that we join this market i refer you to an article in the new york time magazine section nov 12 1961 by mr eric johnston entitle we must join the common market he say it have sweep aside petty nationalism age-old rivalry and worn-out custom refer to britain he say we see a nation that traditionally value sovereignty above all else will to give up it economy place this authority in continental hand since the goal of we international planner be a world government this atlantic community would mark a giant step in that direction for once american economic autonomy be absorb a large group be a question of time frankly it be be very cleverly do for in a sense they have we over a barrel listen to what mr johnston have to say consider the savage wound that isolationism would inflict we would lose we export market and deny ourselves the import we need we would be cripple by reduce output industrial decline widespread unemployment but the solution to this dilemma be not the incorporation of the unite state into an atlantic community or economic empire but merely what libertarian like henry hazlitt and ludwig von mises have be argue for year an end to government regulation an end to government competition in industry and a realistic depreciation allowance for industry create a free market here give we a sound debt-free money system and we ll compete with anyone europe and asia combine in short get this governmental monstrosity off we back and we will nt have to worry about european competition or communism either if we want to preserve we sovereignty this be the way to do it not acquiesce to an international plan board if we go into this common market we might just a well stop talk about constitutional guarantee connally amendment or for that matter conservatism in general we welcome this able brief for the negative a part of a many-sided discussion of the atlantic common market which jnr will be continue in we page ed mental telepathy the peiping chinese be the only major silver seller in the world market who stop sell the metal on monday morning november 27 anticipate by two day the announcement of the we treasury that the peg offer price will be remove a professor and the army in 1954 i be draft and after serve two year honorably on active duty i be not require to participate in any far army reserve activity now more than five year late i can not in any realistic sense be call a train soldier but in spite of this i at present a man 31 year of age and a college professor have be recall by direction of the president to report on november 25th to fort devens massachusetts for another twelve month of active duty a an sp 4 the equivalent of a pfc today seven year after the date of i initial induction a a draftee i be assistant professor of philosophy and science at st michael s college for after leave the army in 1956 i spend five year in graduate school first at boston college and then at the university of toronto this time add to that which i have already spend in school prior to i induction in 1954 make a total of twenty-two 22 year of education the possibility of recall into the army be part of the price that a modern american have to pay for the enviable heritage of liberty which he enjoy with this no loyal citizen can quarrel however it seem axiomatic that the government have an obligation to exercise it mandate reasonably equitably and with full regard for the disruption which it inevitably cause in i own case i submit that such reasonable and fair exercise be woefully lack take back into the army now a an sp 4 i be leave 110 college student whose teacher i be a wry sidelight on this be that most of i student have deferment from the draft in order to attend i class at this late date it be impossible for st michael s college to find a suitable replacement for i even apart from the fact that now at the age of 31 i personal life be be totally disrupt for the second time for no very compel reason i can not help look around at the black leather jacket

shall we call the un troop send to the congo willy-nilly by they government to fight for the unite nation if the un troop be not mercenary then the hessian be not mercenary either and if the foreigner fight in the katanga army be mercenary then lafayette and von steuben be mercenary too a be also the member of the lafayette escadrille in the early part of world war 1 and of chennault s fly tiger in

to promote louis capet the week june 3 another analogy have occur to i consider this table 1 louis 14 afj with no strong man and no parliament to dispute he will he be the government 2 regency truman a dust-settling period of decadence and decline 3 louis 15 eisenhower he open he mouth say little and think not at all 4 louis 16 kennedy not completely virtuous but completely incompetent and marie antoinette jacqueline bouvier the beautiful and light-hearted 5 french revolution conservative revolution truly that liberal should choose louis 14 a a bogey-symbol of conservatism be grotesquely ironic consider the louis 14 character of they grand monarque fdr not only in he accretion of absolute power and personal deification le roi gouverne par lui meme but in the disastrous effect of he spend and war policy in defeat louis capet john tower s victory in texas signal once again the end of the divine right of liberalism
