the president s personality would have open that office to he and for the first time a representative of the high office in the land would have be liable to the charge that he have attempt to make it a successorship by inheritance it be testimony to the deep respect in which mr eisenhower be hold by member of all party that the moral consideration raise by he approach to the matter be not explicitly to be broach these begin to be apparent in a press conference hold during the second illness in order that the consult specialist might clarify the president s condition for the nation and if howard rutstein feel impel thereafter to formulate the ethics of the medical profession he article in the atlantic monthly accomplish a good deal more it force we to fix the responsibility for the position in which all medical commentator have be place the discussion of professional ethics inevitably remind we that in the historical perspective the president s decision will finally clarify itself a a moral rather than a medical problem because the responsibility for resolve the issue lie with the president rather than with he doctor nothing raise more surely for we the difficulty simple goodness face in deal with complex moral problem under political pressure for the president have deal with the matter humbly in what he conceive a the democratic way but the problem be one which give we the measure of a man rather than a group of man whether a group of doctor a group of party member assemble at a dinner to give they opinion or the mass of the voter any attempt to reconcile this statement of the central issue in the campaign of 1956 with the nature of the man who could not conceive it a the central issue will at least resolve we confusion about the chaotic and mislead result of the earnestness of both doctor and president in a situation which should never have arise it be a response to the conflict between political pressure and the moral intuition which result in attempt at prediction in no other situation would a group of doctor struggle competently to improve the life expectancy of a man beloved by the world be subject to such merciless and persistent question and before they be prepare to demonstrate the kind of verbal precision which alone can clarify for mankind the problem it face and though we can look back now and see they error we can look back also to the ultimate error it recur in the press conference the president s remark about he run develop a singular tone one which we find in few statement make by public individual on such a matter the press conference become a stage which betray the drift of he private think rather than he conviction he comment thoughtfully a reporter tell we that it be not too important for the individual how he end up he give we a simile to explain he admission that even at the bad period of he second illness it never occur to he there be any renew question about he run a in the battle of the bulge he have no fear about the outcome until he read the american newspaper yet the attitude that the fate of the presidency demand in such a situation be quite distinct from the simple courage that can proceed with battle to be fight regardless of the consequence in this case other should not have have to raise the doubt and fear the presidency demand an incisive awareness of the large implication of the death of any incumbent it be of the utmost importance to the people of america and of the world how they govern president end up during the four year of he term only when that term be end and he be a private citizen again can he be permit the freedom and the courage to discount the danger of he death ironically enough in this instance such personal virtue be a luxury at the national and international level then what be the high kind of morality for the private citizen represent an instance of political immorality and we have the uneasy sense that the cleavage between the moral and the political progress amid the event which concern we for the tone of the editorial which greet mr eisenhower s original announcement of he run have be strangely disquieting neither the vibrant enthusiasm which bespeak a people s intuitive sense of the fitness of thing at climactic moment nor the vital argumentation betray it sense that something significant have transpire be in evidence nothing testify more clearly to that cleavage than the peculiar editorial page appear in a july issue of life magazine the issue which also carry the second announcement of the candidacy the double editorial on two aspect of the we spirit be subtly calculate to suggest a moral sanction for gamble great a well a small reflect popular approval of this questionable attitude toward the high office in the land the moral creed and the will to risk live happily together if we do not examine where the line be to be draw i may possibly be a great risk than be the normal person of i age the president have say on february 29th of the election year ignore the fact that no one of he age have ever live out another term i doctor assure i that this increase percentage of risk be not great but by the time the risk be double event have dismiss from he mind both increase percentage and a previously state intention of consider carefully anything more serious than a bout of influenza only infrequently do the situation color he think ironically no president we have have would have regret more than president eisenhower the possibility to which he own word in the press conference hold at the begin of august testify that unable a he be himself to say he run be good for the country unconsciously he have place he party before he nation so it be that we relive he open statement in the first television address with the dramatic immediacy of the present no consideration of risk urge itself upon he now for this be what the mind do with the idea on which it have not properly focus yet with a mind less shallow if less sharp than some of the fortune-happy syndicate which back he he feel what he can not formulate and we watch he amid the overtone which suggest he could never in any conscience urge a risk upon the voter move a he be into the phase of the campaign which demand conviction of he he adopt a position that be morally indefensible he ascribe to the mercy of god the peace which this personal matter the assurance that he can physically sustain the burden of the office long than any individual in the history of we nation have be able to do have bring he what be simply an opinion form in defiance of the law of human probability whether or not it be late confirm have become by september of the election year a firm conviction a a mean of silence a discussion which ought to have take place the statement be an effective one we sympathize with the universal confusion which give rise to such conviction but it be also the climax to one of the absorb chapter in we current political history in assign to god the responsibility which he learn could not rest with he doctor eisenhower give evidence of that weaken of the moral intuition which be to characterize he administration in the year to follow in any other man this reassurance to the electorate would have cause we a profound moral shock about this man we have to think twice we know that it be a reassurance the ironic fruit of a deeply moral nature but the fact remain that even the unconscious acceptance of himself a a man of destiny divinely protect must be censor in any man who evade the responsibility for he major decision and thus for impose he will on the people and in the context of drift personal utterance we have examine there be occasional evidence of the origin of all such evasion when the possibility that he have not give reconsideration to so weighty a decision seem to disconcert he questioner mr eisenhower be know to make he characteristic statement to the press that he be not go to talk about the matter any more think have stop it be not to be resume the portrait that have develop fragmentarily but consistently be the portrait of a man to whom serious think be alien enough that the make of a decision inhibit when it do not forestall any ability to review the decision in the light of new evidence this do not mean that the decision to run for office should inevitably have be revoke instead it mean that the think in which decision issue have the power to determine the morality of the decision a in this instance the pressure for renew practical or legislative attention to the constitutional problem the decision have uncover might have do drift through a third illness apparently without any provision for the handle of a major national emergency other than a talk with the vice-president eisenhower reveal the singularly static quality of he think despite three warning no sense of moral urgency impel he to distinguish he situation and thus he responsibility from wilson s by contrast the energetic reaction of the leader to the full demand he decision impose upon he strengthen the moral intuition and give we the measure of the man only by mean of an intensive preoccupation with the detail consideration follow from any decision can he ensure attention to the practical detail to be deal with if the implication of immorality in the major decision be effectively to be check in the incessant struggle with recalcitrant political fact he learn to focus the essence of a problem in the significant detail and to articulate the distinction which clarify the detail a significant with what be sometimes astound rapidity like lincoln he can distinguish he relation to god from the constitutional responsibility a questionable decision exact of he like roosevelt he can distinguish an attitude toward a russian leader he may share with a host of american from the responsibility diplomatic convention may impose upon he he choose to subordinate one to the other sometimes reluctantly accept criticism for the lesser immorality fact breed the very nature of a choice so ground in distinction and fact lead to the valid conviction which become force of will in the manifest leader the capacity for make the distinction of which diplomacy be compact and the facility with language which can render they into validity in the eye of other man be the leader s mean for transform the moral intuition into moral leadership the make of distinction like the perception of the great distinction make be an inordinately difficult business lincoln s slow progress towards the several mark he achievement be even now unrecognizable a such and loosely interpret a the alternation of inconsistency with vision but because it be the function of the mind to turn the one into the other by mean of the capacity with which word endow it we do not unwisely examine the type of distinction in the sphere of politics on which decision hang only recently and perhaps because a television debate can so effectively dramatize president kennedy s extraordinary mastery of detail have the ability on which the capacity for make distinction depend begin to be clearly discernible at the level of politics in he recent evaluation of kennedy s potentiality for leadership walter lippmann have cite the precision of he mind he immense command of factual detail and he instinct for the crucial point a impressive in the extreme and it be surely clear that the first of these be the result of the way in which the individual s command of language interact with the other two
