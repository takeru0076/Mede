because individual class of food differ in they requirement for preservation a number of method have be develop over the year involve one or a combination of procedure such a dehydration fermentation salt chemical treatment can refrigeration and freeze the basic objective in each instance be to make available supply of food during the interval between harvest or slaughter to minimize loss result from the action of microorganism and insect and to make it possible to transport food from the area of harvest or production to area of consumption in early year the preservation of food be essentially relate to survival in the more sophisticate atmosphere of today s develop nation food-preservation technique have } seek also to bring variety peak freshness and optimum taste and flavor in food at reasonable cost to the consumer with the development of nuclear technology isotopic material and machine radiation source in recent year the possibility of apply ionize radiation to the preservation of food attract the attention of investigator in the unite state and throughout the world an early hope that irradiation might be the ultimate answer to practically all food preservation problem be soon dispel interest remain however in the possibility that it would serve a a useful supplementary method for counteract spoilage loss and for preserve some food at low over-all cost than freeze or without employ heat or chemical with they attendant taste alteration factor responsible for the spoilage of food the chief factor responsible for the spoilage of fresh foodstuff be 1 microorganism such a bacterium mold and yeast 2 enzyme 3 insect 4 sprout and 5 chemical reaction microorganism be often responsible for the rapid spoilage of food of special concern be the growth of bacterium such a clostridium botulinum which generate poisonous product enzymatic action in store food produce change which can adversely affect the appearance of food or it palatability spoilage by chemical action result from the reaction of one group of component in the food with other or with it environment a in corrosion of the wall of metal container or the reaction of fat with oxygen in the air to produce rancidity sprout be a naturally occur phenomenon in store potato onion carrot beet and similar root vegetable insect infestation be a problem of importance chiefly in store grain the presence of parasitic organism such a trichinella spiralis in pork introduce another factor which must be deal with in food process to permit the storage of food for long period of time a method of preservation must accomplish the destruction of microorganism and inhibition of enzymatic action the term sterilization apply to method involve essentially complete destruction of all microorganism food treat in this manner and protect from recontamination by aseptic method of package and containment presumably could be store for long period without refrigeration the process of pasteurization involve mild and less prolong heat treatment which accomplish the destruction of most but not all of the microorganism less severe thermal treatment a by blanch or scald serve to inactivate enzyme general effect of ionize radiation ionize radiation can cause the destruction of microorganism and insect involve in food spoilage or at low dose can inhibit they action it furnish a mean of destroy insect in store grain product a well a certain parasitic organism present in meat deactivation of enzyme be also possible although some type require extremely heavy dose of 10 mrad or more because of undesirable flavor odor color and generally low palatability associate with radiation treatment of this magnitude the inactivation of enzyme be good accomplish prior to irradiation by the conventional heat-processing method of blanch radiation do not retard the chemical spoilage of food it will however inhibit the sprout of potato and other root vegetable the radiation dose require for the preservation of food be in the follow range 1 for radiosterilization to destroy all organism for long-term preservation about 45 mrad for nonacid food of low salt content 2 for radiopasteurization to partially destroy microorganism result vary with type of food storage condition and objective of treatment commonly of the order of 02 mrads but up to about 08 afj 3 for destruction of insect about 25000 afj 4 for inhibit the sprout of root vegetable 4000 to 10000 afj preserve food with ionize radiation lead to some undesirable side effect particularly at the high radiation dosage in this respect the general palatability and individual acceptance of most radiosterilized food have to date be find to be low in comparison with fresh and commercially process food a number of food be quite acceptable a regard taste and palatability however at dosage substantially less than sterilization level moreover the nutritive value of irradiate food apparently undergo little if any change although some of the fat-soluble vitamin be affect by sterilization dose radiation source for irradiation of food the result obtain depend upon the dose rather than the specific type of radiation and x-ray gamma and high-energy electron radiation be suitable aside from availability and economic consideration each have certain practical advantage for example gamma ray give deep penetration but can not be focus or collimate whereas unidirectional electron beam may be split and direct to both the top and bottom of the food package to be irradiate selection of a source for commercial irradiation would involve consideration of numerous factor include require dose rate load factor throughput convenience safety and most important cost of the potentially useful source of ionize radiation gamma source cobalt-60 cesium-137 fission product or a reactor irradiation loop system use a material such a an indium salt have receive most attention for food-preservation system of the various particle accelerator the van de graff machine resonant transformer and linear accelerator be the principal one available for commercial use cost of the effective energy produce by these source be a major obstacle in the development of food-preservation process estimate production cost of radiation energy from machine and nuclide source range from $ 1 to $ 10 per afj conventional energy for process food be available in the range of at most a few cent per kwhr for electric power and the equivalent of a few mill per kwhr for process steam radiation therefore be at an initial cost disadvantage even though only 1 to 10 per cent a much radiation energy a heat energy be require for radiopasteurization or radiosterilization what be the possibility of lower radiation production cost for the future it have be estimate that for application on a megawatt scale cost might reach value in the neighborhood of 10 cent per kwhr for large-scale accelerator or for gamma radiation generate in a reactor core no comparable reduction in the cost of nuclide radiation be foresee such projection however appear highly speculative and the capacity involve be far beyond those foresee for food-preservation facility because agricultural activity be seasonal and the area of production and harvest of many food be widely scatter geographically and because of the high cost of transport bulk food item any substantial distance to a central process location the use of large central process station where low-cost radiation facility approach the megawatt range might be utilize be inherently impracticable present status of irradiation preservation of food the objective of complete sterilization of food be to produce a wholesome and palatable product capable of be store without refrigeration for extend period of time chief interest in radiosterilization reside in the military service for they provide appetizing food under battle or emergency condition be a paramount consideration they require completely sterile food capable of be store without refrigeration preferably item already cook and ready to eat high nutritional value variety palatability and appetizing appearance be important for reason of morale food for rear station which require cook but no refrigeration be also of interest of primary interest be meat radiopasteurization which produce fewer adverse sensory change in food product have potential usefulness in prolong the keep quality of fresh and refrigerate food item thus food so process might reach more remote market and permit the consumer to enjoy more produce at peak freshness and palatability commercial interest be chiefly in this type of treatment a be military interest under peacetime condition the present status of food preservation by ionize radiation be discuss by food class in the follow paragraph meat the radiation process of meat have receive extensive investigation to date the one meat show favorable result at sterilization dose be pork of particular interest to the military service be the demonstration that roast pork after radiosterilization be superior in palatability to available can pork product test with beef have be largely unsuccessful because of the development of off-flavors a prime objective of the army quartermaster corps program be to find the reason for beef s low palatability and mean of overcome it since it be a major and desirable dietary item partly because low-level heat treatment be need to inactivate enzyme before radiosterilization treat fresh meat have the appearance of boil or can meat off-flavor be a less severe problem with the radiopasteurization of meat but problem of commercial acceptability remain moderate radiation dose of from 100000 to 200000 rad can extend the shelf life at 35 f of fresh beef from 5 day to 5 or 6 week however the problem of consumer acceptability remain the preradiation blanch process discolors the treat beef and liquid accumulate in prepackage cut cook beef irradiate in the absence of oxygen assume an unnatural pink color when lamb and mutton be irradiate at substerilization dose the meat become dehydrate the fat become chalky and again unnatural change in color occur ground meat such a fresh pork sausage and hamburger have a relatively short shelf life under refrigeration and radiopasteurization might be think to offer distinctly improve keep quality however a major problem here be one of scale of process ground meat be usually prepare from scrap meat at the local level whereas irradiation at economic volume of production would require central process and distribution facility the problem of color change by blanch and liquid accumulation within the package be the same a for solid cut specialty cook item contain meat portion a in freeze dinner might offer a potential use for radiopasteurization the principal potential advantage would be that the finish product could be transport and store at low cost under refrigeration instead of be freeze a refrigerate item could also be heat and serve in less time than be require for freeze food of the same type competitive process for preserve meat be by can and freeze cost of can meat be in the range of 08 to 5 cent per pound cost of freeze be in the area of 2 to 35 cent per pound the table on page 10 show cost of can and freeze meat and estimate cost for irradiation under certain assume condition under the condition of comparison it will be note that 1 radiosterilization at 3 mrad be more expensive than can particularly for the cesium-137 source 2 radiopasteurization by either the electron accelerator or cesium-137 source be in the range of freeze cost 3 irradiation use the nuclide source be more expensive than use of an electron accelerator poultry result of irradiation test with poultry have be quite successful at sterilize dose good palatability result with a minimum of change in appearance taste and odor radiopasteurization have also be successful and the shelf life of chicken can be extend to a month or more under refrigerate storage a compare with about 10 day for the untreated product acceptable taste and odor be retain by the irradiate and refrigerate chicken acceptance of radiopasteurization be likely to be delay however for two reason 1 the storage life of fresh chicken under refrigeration be become a minimal problem because of constantly improve sanitation and distribute practice and 2 treatment by antibiotic a measure already approve by the federal food and drug administration serve to extend the storage life of chicken at a low cost of about 05 cent per pound seafood fresh seafood product be extremely perishable although refrigeration have serve to extend the storage life of these product substantially increase consumption might be possible if area remote from the seacoast could be serve adequately
