more likely you simply tell yourself a you hand we the book that it matter little what we incant provide we undergo the discipline of incantation for pride s sake i will not say that the coy and leer vade mecum of those verse insinuate itself into i soul besides that particular message do no more than weakly echo the roar in all fresh blood but what you could not know of course be how smoothly the victorian fitzgerald be to lead into an american fitzgerald of i own vintage under whose banner we adolescent be to come if not of age then into a bright taut semblance of it i do not suppose you ever hear of f scott fitzgerald live or dead and moreover i do not suppose that even if you have he legend would have seem to you to warrant more than a cluck of disapproval neither he appetite he exacerbation nor he despair be kin to yours he might have be the man in the moon for all you could have understand he but he be no man in the moon to i although he tender night be not the one i dream of nor be it for yacht sport car tall drink and swim pool nor yet for money or what money buy that i burn i too be burn and watch myself burn the flame be simply of a different kind it be symbolize at least for those of we who recognize ourselves in the image by that self-consuming elegiac candle of edna st vincent millay s that candle which from the quatrain where she ensconce it become a beacon to we but which in point of fact would have have to be a tall a a funeral taper to last even the even let alone the night one should not of course pluck the head off a flower and expect it perfume to linger on yet this passion for passion now that i look back on it with passion spend seem somewhat overblown and operatic though a a diva miss millay perfectly control she note only what else be she sing but the old song of song that most ancient of tune that nature play with such unfailing response upon young nerve perhaps this be not so little perhaps the mere fact that by pluck on the nerve nature can awaken in the most ordinary of we temporarily anyway the sleep poet and in poet can discover they immortality be the most remarkable of all the remarkable phenomenon to which we can attest one can see it a humiliate that an extra hormone casually feed into we chemistry may induce we to lie down we life for a lover or a friend one can take it a no more than another veil tear from the mystery of the soul but it could also be look at from the other end of the spectrum one could see this chemical determinant a in itself a miracle in any case miss millay s sweet-throated bitterness she variation on the theme that the world be not only well lose for love but even well lose for lose love she constant and wonderfully tragic posture so unlike that of fitzgerald since it require no scenery or prop draw from the i that i be when i fall upon she verse an overwhelming yea but all this i be well aware be the bel canto of love and although i have always like to think that it be to the bel canto and to that alone that i listen i know well enough that it be not if i be to speak the whole truth about i knowledge of love i will have to stop try to emulate the transcendant nightingale there be another side of love more nearly symbolize by the croak of the mate capercailzie or good still perhaps by the mute antic of the slug whether you experience the passion of desire i have of course no way of know nor indeed have i wish with even the most fleet fragment of a wish to know for the fact that one constitute by one s mere existence so to speak the proof of some sort of passion make any speculation upon this part of one s parent experience more immodest more scandalize more deeply unwelcome than an obscenity from a strange i recoil from the very think at the same time i be aware that i recoil could be interpret by reader of the tea leave at the bottom of i psyche a an incestuous sign since theirs be a science of paradox if one hate they say it be because one love if one bully they say it be because one be afraid if one shun they say it be because one desire and accord to they whatever one fancy one feel what one feel in fact be the opposite well normally abnormal or normally normal neurotic or merely fastidious do the tea-leaf reader by the way allow psych to have moral taste i have never want to know what you know of passion you probably would not remember since you never seem to remember even the same moment a i much less they intensity one sunny midday on fifth avenue when you have set out with i for some final shop less than a week before the wedding you stage for i with such reluctance at the farm i can see we now we have be walk quite briskly for despite you be so small and i so tall you stride in those day could easily match i we have stop before a shop window to assess it autumnal display when you suddenly turn to i look up from beneath one of you wrong hat and with you nervous ahem say there be thing i must tell you about this man you be marry which he do not know himself if you have scream right there in the street where we stand i could not have feel more fear with scarcely a mumble of excuse i flee i flee however not from what might have be the natural fear of be unable to disguise from you that the thing about i bridegroom in the sense you mean the word thing which you have be galvanize yourself to tell i a a painful part of you maternal duty be thing which i have already insist upon find out for myself despite i may now say the unspeakable awkwardness of make the discovery on principle yes on principle and in cold blood because i be resolve a a modern woman not to be a mollycoddle wait for life but to seize life by the throat i have develop too foolproof a facade to be afraid of self-betrayal what i flee from be i fear of what unwittingly you might betray without mean to about i father and yourself but i can see from this late trick of memory how much more arbitrary and influential it be than the will while i memory hold with relentless tenacity a i can not too often stress to i wrong when it come to i shame it gesture and joke and toy with chronology like a prestidigitator in the hope of distract i from they just a i be about to enlarge upon i discovery of the underside of the leaf of love memory displease at be ask to yield it unsavory secret dash ahead of i call back over it shoulder skip it cut it out but i will not skip it or cut it out it be not i intention in this narrative to picture myself a a helpless victim moor to the rock of experience and leave to the buffeting of chance if to be innocent be to be helpless then i have be a be we all helpless at the start but the time come when i be no long innocent and therefore no long helpless helpless in that sense i can never be again however i confess i hope that i will be innocent again not with a pristine accidental innocence but rather with an innocence achieve by the slow cut away of the flesh to reach the bone for innocence of all the grace of the spirit be i believe the one most to be pray for although it be constantly make to look foolish too simple to come in out of the rain people say who have find in the innocent an impediment it do not mind look foolish because it be not concern with how it look it assume that thing be a they seem when they seem good and when they seem bad it overlook they to innocence a word give be a word that will be keep instinctively innocence do unto other a it expect to be do by but when these expectation be once too often ground into the dust innocence can falter since it strength be accord to the strength of he who possess it the innocence of which i speak be i know not incorruptible but i insist upon believe that even when it be lose it may like paradise be regain however it be not of innocence in general that i be speak but of perhaps the frail and surely the least important side of it which be innocence in romantic love here if anywhere it be not wholly incontrovertible to you for instance the word innocence in this connotation probably retain it biblical or should i say technical sense and therefore i suppose i must make myself quite clear by say that i lose or rather hand over what you would have consider to be i innocence two week before i be legally entitle and in fact by oath require to hand it over along with what other goods and bad i have but to i innocence be far less tangible i have long since begin to lose i general innocence when i lose i trust in you but this special innocence i lose before ever i love through i discovery that one could tremble with desire and even experience a flame delight that have nothing nothing whatever to do with friendship or like let alone with love i know this knowledge to be corrupt at the time i acquire it today these many year late after all the temptation resist or yield to the weasel satisfaction and the engulf dissatisfaction since endure i call it corrupt still you i could swear to it remain innocent in this sense until the end yours but not i be an age in which innocence be foster and carefully if not perhaps altogether innocently preserve you have grow up at a time when the most distinguish mark of a lady be the noli i tangere writ plain across she face moreover because of the particular blot on you family escutcheon through what may only have be one unbridled moment on you grandmother s part and because you have the lean-to kitchen and trundle bed of you childhood to outgrow what you obviously most desire with both you conscious and unconscious person what you bend you whole will sensibility and intelligence upon be to be a lady before be daughter wife or mother before be culture a word now bereft both socially and politically of the sheen you child of frontiersman bestow on it before be sorry for the poor progressive about public health and prettily if somewhat imprecisely humanitarian indeed first and foremost you be a lady there be of course more to the portrait of a lady you carry in you mind s eye than the sine qua non of she virtue a lady you make clear to i both by precept and example never raise she voice or slump in she chair never fail in social tact in heaven for instance would not mention st john the baptist s head never pout or withdraw or scandalize in company never remind other of she physical presence by unseemly sound or gesture never indulge in public scene or private confidence never speak of money save in term of alleviate suffer never gossiped or malign never stress but always minimize the hopelessness of anything from sin to death itself
