a year ago it be bruit that the primary character in erich maria remarque s new novel be base on the marquis alfonso de portago the spanish nobleman who die drive in the mille miglia automobile race of 1957 if this be in fact mr remarque s intention he have achieve a notable failure clerfayt of heaven have no favorite resemble portago only in that he be male and a race-driver quite a bad race-driver whereas portago be a good one he be a dull unformed and aimless person the twelfth marquis de portago be intelligent purposeful and passionate one look forward to mr remarque s ninth book if only because not even a reasonably good novel have yet be write ground on automobile race a dramatic a sport a mankind have devise unhappily heaven have no favorite do not alter the record except to add one more bad book to the list mr remarque s conception of this novel be sound and perhaps even noble he propose throw together a man in an occupation of high hazard and a woman balance on a knife-edge between death from tuberculosis and recovery he treatment of it be something else he heroine choose to die the price of recovery year under the strict regimen of a sanatorium be high than she wish to pay she lover precede she in death at the wheel and presumably he too have choose between the first meet of clerfayt and lillian and this dismal denouement mr remarque have lay down many page of junior-philosophical discourse some demure and rather fetch love-making pleasant talk about some of the countryside and restaurant of europe and a modicum of automobile race the rambling on life death and the wonder of it all be distressing the love-making perhaps because it be pale and low-key when one have be condition to expect harsh color and explicitness be often charm the automobile race bear little relation to reality this latter failure be more than merely bad reportage and it be distinctly more important than it would have be have the author draw clerfayt a say a tournament golfer hazard to life and limb on the golf course while existent be actuarially insignificant race-drivers on the other hand be quite often kill on the circuit and since it be obviously mr remarque s intention to establish automobile race a life in microcosm one might reasonably have expect he to demonstrate precise knowledge not only of technique but of more and attitude he do not the jacket biography describe he a a former race driver and he may indeed have be although i do not recall have encounter he name either in the record or the literature perhaps he have only forget a great deal the book carry a disclaimer in which remarque say it have be necessary for he to take minor liberty with some of the procedure and formality of race the necessity be not clear to i and in any case to present a case-hardened race-driver a say he have leave he car which or whom he call giuseppe park on the place vendome sneer at a dozen bentleys and rolls-royces park around he be not a liberty it be an absurdity but it be in the matter of preoccupation with death which be the primary concern of the book that remarque s failure be plain clerfayt be neurotic preoccupy and passive to be human he believe be to seek one s own destruction the freudian death-wish cliche inevitably cite whenever layman talk about auto race-drivers in point of fact the race-drivers one know be nearly always intelligent healthy technician who differ from other technician only in the depth of the passion they feel for the work by which they live a clerfayt may moon on about the face of death in the cockpit a portago could say a he do say to i if i die tomorrow still i have have twenty-eight wonderful year but i shall nt die tomorrow i ll live to be 105 clerfayt transport may think of the engine drive he car a a mystical beast under the hood the italian master piero taruffi no less sensitive know twice the ecstasy though he think of a car s adhesion to a wet two-lane road at 165 mile an hour a a matter good express in algebraic formula clerfayt drive see himself a volcano whose cone funneled down to hell the briton stirling moss one of the great virtuoso of all time believe that ultra-fast road-circuit drive be an art form relate to ballet error in technical terminology suggest that the over-all translation from the german may not convey quite everything mr remarque hope to tell we however i principal objection in this sort of novel be to the hackneyed treatment of race-drivers pilot submariner atomic researcher and all the machine-masters of we age a brood mystic or hysterical fatalists the west be leaderless accord to this book in contrast the east be ably lead by such stalwart hero a khrushchev tito and mao against this invincible determination to communize the whole world stand a group of nation unable to agree on fundamental and each refuse to make any sacrifice of sovereignty for the common good of all it be field marshal montgomery s belief that in most western country about 60 per cent of the people do not really care about democracy or christianity about 30 per cent call themselves christian in order to keep up appearance and be consider respectable and only the last 10 per cent be genuine christian and believer in democracy but these western country do care about themselves each feel intensely national if say the russian intend to stop tom jones go to the pub then tom jones would fight the commie but he would fight for he own liberty rather than for any abstract principle connect with it such a cause for all practical purpose the west stand disunited undedicated and unprepared for the task of world leadership with this barrage montgomery of alamein launch he attack upon the blundering of the west never give to mince word he place heavy blame upon the faulty uncourageous leadership of britain and particularly america at war s end leadership in western europe pass from britain because the labour government devote it attention to the creation of a welfare state with britain look inward overseas problem be neglect and the baton be pass on to the unite state montgomery believe that she start well america give generously in economic aid and military equipment to friend and foe alike she push wartorn and poverty-stricken nation into prosperity but she fail to lead they into unity and world peace america have divide more than she have unite the west the reason be that america generally believe that she can buy anything with dollar and that she compulsively strive to be like however she really do not know how to match the quantity of dollar give away by a quality of leadership that be basically need but the great reason for fumble stumble american leadership be due to the shock she pride suffer when the japanese attack at pearl harbor they be determine montgomery write not to be surprise again and now insist on a state of readiness for war which be not only unnecessary but also create nervousness among other nation in the western alliance not to mention such great suspicion among the nation of the eastern bloc that any progress towards peaceful coexistence or disarmament be not possible the net result be that under american leadership the general world situation have become bad to monty the american people who in two previous world war be very reluctant to join the fight now look like the nation most likely to lead we all into a third world war a faulty a have be we leadership clearly the unite state must be rely upon to lead the path to leadership be make clear montgomery call for a leader who will first put the west s own house in order such a man must be able and will to give clear and sensible advice to the whole group a person in whom all the member nation will have absolute confidence this leader must be a man who life above illusion that heretofore have shape the foreign policy of the unite state namely that russia will agree to a reunite germany that the east german government do not exist that event in japan in june 1960 be communist-inspired that the true government of china be in formosa that mao be the evil influence behind khrushchev at the summit conference in paris in may 1960 and that either china or russia want or expect war such a leader must strengthen nato politically and establish that true unity about which it have always talk after drastically overhaul nato western leadership should turn to reduce the suspicion that tear apart the east and west major to this effort be to get all world power to withdraw to they own territory say by 1970 the west should make the central proposal but the east would have to show sincerity in carry it out but where be the leader who will handle all these thing for we montgomery know all the national leader up to the time of kennedy the man whom he would select a we leader for this great task be de gaulle he alone have the wisdom the conviction the tenacity and the courage to reach a decision but de gaulle be bury in the cause of restore france s lose soul whoever rise to the occasion walk a treacherous path to leadership the leader montgomery envisage will need to discipline himself lead a carefully regulate and orderly life allow time for quiet think and reflection adapt decision and plan to change situation be ruthless particularly with inefficiency and be honest and morally proper all in all montgomery call for a leader who will anticipate and dominate the event that surround he in look a far back a moses thence to cromwell napoleon lincoln churchill and nehru montgomery attempt to trace the stirring and quality of great man he believe that greatness be a marriage between the man and the time a be aptly represent by churchill who would very possibly have go down in history a a political failure if it have not be for hitler s war however montgomery make little contribution to leadership theory and practice most of what be say about he great man of history have already be say and what have not be largely irrelevant to the contemporary scene like eisenhower he hold the militarist s suspicion of politician however at the same time montgomery select a he hero de gaulle who be a militarist dominate by political ambition monty show a remarkable capacity for the direct statement and an equally remarkable incapacity for give adequate support for the most part he write ramble and jog prevent easy access by the reader to he true thought nevertheless montgomery have state courageously and wisely the crisis of the western world it suffer from a lack of unity of purpose and respect for heroic leadership and it remain to be see if the new frontier now take form can produce the leadership and wisdom necessary to understand the current shape of event it be no common thing for a listener critical or otherwise to hear a singer live for the first time only after he have die but then mario lanza be no common singer and he whole career public and non-public be stud with the kind of unconventional happening that terminate with the appearance of he first recital only when he have cease to be a live voice it be a kind of justice too that it
