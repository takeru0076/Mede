trevelyan s liberalism be above all a liberalism of the spirit a deep feel of communion with man fight for country and for liberty he passion and enthusiasm convey the courage and high adventure of garibaldi s exploit and give the reader a unique sense of participation in the event describe the three volume bring to the fore a characteristic of trevelyan s prose which remain conspicuous through he late work a genius for describe military action with clarity and with authority the confuse rambling of guerrilla warfare such a most of garibaldi s campaign be be bring to life by trevelyan s pen in some of the good passage in the book he personal familiarity with the scene of action undoubtedly contribute much to the final result but familiarity alone would not have be enough without other quality military knowledge love of detail and a sure feel for the portrayal of action be the add ingredient but the garibaldi volume be more than a romantic story trevelyan contribute considerable new knowledge of the issue connect with he subject the outstanding example be in garibaldi and the thousand where he make use of unpublished paper of lord john russell and english consular material to reveal the motive which lead the british government to permit garibaldi to cross the strait of messina in look back over the volume it be possible to find error of interpretation some of which be not so evident at the time of write thus trevelyan repeat the story which picture victor emmanuel a refuse to abandon the famous statuto at the insistence of general radetzky late research have show this part of the legend of the re galantuomo to be false trevelyan accept italian nationalism with little analysis he be unduly critical of papal and french policy and he be more than generous in assess british policy but fifty year late the trilogy still maintain a firm place in the list of standard work on the unification of italy a position cautiously prophesy by the reviewer at the time of publication trevelyan s manin and the venetian revolution of 1848 he last major volume on an italian theme be write in a minor key publish in 1923 it do not gain the popular acclaim of the garibaldi volume probably because trevelyan feel less at home with manin the bourgeois lawyer than with garibaldi the filibuster the complexity of venetian politics elude he but the story of the revolution itself be tell in restrain measure with no superfluous passage and only an occasional overemphasis of the part play by it lead figure if it be not one of he good book it can only be consider unsatisfactory when compare with he own garibaldi already trevelyan have begin to parallel he nineteenth-century italian study with several work on english figure of the same period first the life of john bright appear and seven year late lord grey of the reform bill of the two the life of bright be incomparably the good biography trevelyan center too exclusively on bright be insufficiently appreciative of the view of bright s opponent and critic and make light of the genuine difficulty face by peel yet he be right when he claim in he autobiography that he draw the real feature of the man he tender and selfless motive and he rugged fearless strength in the story of bright and the corn law agitation the crimean war the american civil war and the franchise struggle trevelyan reflect something of the moral power which enable this independent man to exercise so immense an influence over he fellow countryman for so long because bright s speech be so much a part of he there be long and numerous quotation which far from make the biography diffuse help to give we the feel of the man associate in a sense with the manchester school through he mother s family trevelyan convey in this biography something of it moral conviction and drive nineteenth-century virtue however seem somehow to have go out of fashion and the bright book have never be particularly popular the biography of lord grey be strictly speak not a biography at all it be a whig history of the tory reaction which precede the reform bill of 1832 and it use the figure of grey to give some unity to the narrative the volume be a piece of passionate special plead write with the heat and often with the wisdom it must be say of a liberal damn the shortsightedness of politician from 1782 to 1832 characteristically trevelyan enjoy write the work the theme of glorious summer come after a long winter of discontent and repression be he have tell we congenial to he artistic sense and grey s northumberland background be close to trevelyan s own but he concentration on personality and he categorical assessment of they action fail to convey the political complexity of a long generation harass by world-wide war and confront with the problem of adjustment to an unprecedented industrial and social transformation some historian have find he point of view not to they taste other have complain that he make the tory tradition appear contemptible rather than intelligible while a sympathetic critic have remark that the intricate interplay of social dynamics and political activity of which at time politician be the ignorant marionette be not a field for the exercise of he talent the liberal-radical heritage which inform all of trevelyan s interpretation of history here seem clearly to have distort the issue and oversimplify the period for once he touch desert he research in the period of grey and bright lead naturally to a more ambitious work britain in the nineteenth century be a textbook design to give the sense of continuous growth to show how economic lead to social and social to political change how the political event react on the economic and social and how new thought and new ideal accompany or direct the whole complicate process the plan be admirably fulfil for the period up to 1832 more temperately than in the study of grey and despite he liberal bias trevelyan vividly sketch the england of pre-french revolution day portray the stress and strain of the revolutionary period in rich color and bring development lead to the reform bill into sharp and clear focus he technique be genuinely masterful by what one reader call a series of dissolve view he merge one period into another and give a sense of continuous growth but after 1832 the narrative tend to lose it balance many-sided quality and to become a medley of topic often unconnected by any single thread economic analysis be never trevelyan s strong point and the england of the industrial transformation cry out for economic analysis yet after 1832 the interrelation of economic and social and political affair become blur and the narrative become largely a conventional political account finally the period after 1870 receive little attention and that quite superficial yet britain in the nineteenth century become the vade mecum of begin student of history go through edition after edition and continue to be reprint up to the very present it success be a tribute above all to trevelyan s brilliance a a literary stylist in 1924 trevelyan travel to the unite state where he deliver the lowell lecture at harvard university these lecture form the nucleus of a general survey of english development which take form afterward a a history of england in short order the general history become he most popular work and have remain aside from he late social history the work most widely favore by the public the history of england have often be compare with green s short history like green trevelyan aim to write a history not of english king or english conquest but of the english people the result be fortunate the history take too much for grant to serve a a text for other than english schoolboy and like britain in the nineteenth century it deteriorate badly a it go beyond 1870 trevelyan s excursion into contemporary history be rarely happy one but a a stimulate provocative interpretation of the broad sweep of english development it be incomparable live picture of the early borough country life in tudor and stuart time the impact of the industrial revolution compete with sensitive survey of language and literature the common law parliamentary development the strength of the history be also it weakness trevelyan be militantly sure of the superiority of english institution and character over those of other people he nationalism be not a new characteristic but it self-consciousness even it self-satisfaction be more obvious in a book that stretch over the long reach of english history and yet the element which capture he liberal and humanistic imagination be those which make the english story worth tell and worth remember tolerance and compromise social justice and civil liberty be today too often in short supply for one to be overly critical of trevelyan s emphasis on they central place in the english tradition like most major work of synthesis the history of england be inform by the positive view of a first-class mind and this be surely a major work four year after the publication of the history of england the first volume of trevelyan s queen anne trilogy appear by now he have become regius professor of modern history at cambridge and have be honore by the award of the order of merit he academic duty have little evident effect on he prolific pen blenheim be follow in rapid succession by ramillies and the union with scotland and by the peace and the protestant succession the three form together a detail picture of england under queen anne like he volume on wycliffe the work be accompany by the publication of a select group of document in this case illustrative of the history of queen anne s reign down to 1707 trevelyan be at least in part attract to the period by an almost unconscious desire to take up the story where macaulay s history of england have break off in addition he believe in the dramatic unity and separateness of the period from 1702-14 lie between the stuart and hanoverian era with a special ethos of it own he see the age a one in which britain settle she free constitution and attain she modern place in the world to most observer there be little doubt that he place an artificial strait jacket of unity upon the year of anne s reign which in reality exist only in the page of he history of the three volume blenheim be easily the good in four open chapter reminiscent of macaulay s famous third chapter trevelyan survey the state of england at the open of the eighteenth century he delightful picture of society and institution be fill with warm detail that bring the period vividly to life he tend to underestimate or perhaps to view charitably the brutality and the violence of the age so that there be an idyllic quality in these page which haze over some of it sharp reality yet a an evocation of time past there be few such successful portrait in english historical literature once the scene be set trevelyan skilfully build up the tense story until it reach it climax in the dramatic victory of marlborough and eugene of savoy at blenheim the account of the battle be next to he description of garibaldi s campaign trevelyan s outstanding military narrative the scene be etch in sharp detail the military problem brilliantly explain and the excitement and importance of the battle make evident if only for this modest masterpiece of military history blenheim be likely to be read and reread long after new interpretation have perhaps alter we picture of the marlborough war ramillies and the union with scotland have fewer high spot than blenheim and much less of it dramatic unity yet in several chapter on scotland in the eighteenth century trevelyan cope persuasively with the tangle confusion of scottish politics against a vivid background of scottish religion custom and tradition
