the next question be whether board member favor they own social class in they role a educational policy-maker on the whole it appear that they do not favor they own social class in an explicit way seldom be there an issue in which class line can be clearly draw a hypothetical issue of this sort might deal with the establishment of a free public junior college in a community where there already be a good private college which serve the middle-class youth adequately but be too expensive for working-class youth in situation of this sort the board generally favor the expansion of free education campbell study the record of 172 school board member in twelve western city over the period of 1931 - 40 and find little or no relationship between certain social and economic factor and school board competence a judge by a panel of professional educator who study the vote record on educational issue the few case of clear favoritism along social-class line be a likely a not to involve representative of the work class on the school board who favor some such practice a high wage for janitor rather than pay increase for teacher and such issue be not issue of educational policy in general it appear that trustee and board member attempt to represent the public interest in they administration of educational policy and this be make easy by the fact that the dominant value of the society be middle-class value which be generally think to be valid for the entire society there have be very few case of explicit conflict of interest between the middle class and any other class in the field of educational policy if there be more such case it would be easy to answer the question whether the policy-maker favor they own social class there be currently a major controversy of public education in which group interest and value be heavily engage this be the issue of segregate school in the south in this case it be primarily a matter of conflict of racial group rather than social-class group thus the white middle and low class be array against the negro middle and low class this conflict may be resolve in a way which will suit white middle-class people good than it suit white lower-class people if this happen there may be some class conflict in the south with school board and school teacher take the middle-class position the educational profession the member of the educational profession have a major voice in the determination of educational policy they position be strong in the university they be mostly upper-middle - and lower-middle-class people with a few in the upper class do they make class-biased decision in a society dominate by middle-class value and work in an institution which transmit and strengthen these social value it be clear that the educational profession must work for the value which be characteristic of the society there be no problem here the problem arise if it do arise when the educator have to make a choice or a decision within the area of he professional competence but which bear some relation to the social structure for instance in give school grade or in make recommendation for the award of a college scholarship do he consciously or unconsciously favor student of one or another social class again in decide on the content and method of he teach do he favor a curriculum which will make he student strong competitor in the race for high economic status or do he favor a curriculum which strengthen student in other way the answer to question such a these certainly depend to some extent upon the educator s own social-class position and also upon he social history a well a upon he personality and what he conceive he mission to be a an educator in a set of case study of teacher with various social-class background wattenberg illustrate a variety of approach to student and to teach which depend upon the teacher s personality a well a on he social-class background one upward-mobile teacher may be a hard taskmaster for lower-class pupil because she want they to develop the attitude and skill that will enable they to climb while another upward-mobile teacher may be a very permissive person with lower-class pupil because he know they disadvantage and deprivation at home and he hope to encourage they by friendly treatment one social-class factor which play a large part in educational policy today be the fact that a great many school and college teacher be upward mobile from urban lower-class and lower-middle-class family they own experience in the social system influence they work and attitude a teacher while this influence be a complex matter depend upon personality factor in the individual a well a upon he social-class experience there probably be some general statement about social-class background and educational policy that can be make with a fair degree of truth teacher who have be upward mobile probably see education a most valuable for they student if it serve student a it have serve they that be they be likely to favor a kind of education that have vocational-advancement value this do not necessarily mean that such teacher will favor vocational education a contrast with liberal education but they be likely to favor an approach to liberal education which have a maximal vocational-advancement value a against a kind of pure liberal education that be not design to help people get good job there be no doubt that high education since world war 2 have move away from pure liberal education toward great emphasis on technology and specialization there be several cause for this one be rapid economic development with increase number of of middle-class position require engineering or scientific train but another cause may lie in the experience of so many new postwar faculty member with they own use of education a a mean of social advancement compare with the college and university faculty member of the period from 1900 to 1930 the new postwar faculty member consist of more child of immigrant and more child of urban working-class father they experience be quite in contrast with that of child of upper - and upper-middle-class native-born parent who be more likely to regard education a good for it own sake and to discount the vocational emphases in the curriculum the public interest group educational policy be form by several group who be officially or unofficially appoint to act in the public interest legislator be one such group and state legislator have major responsibility for educational legislation they generally vote so a to serve they own constituency and if the constituency should be solidly middle class or solidly low class they might be expect to vote and work for middle - or for lower-class interest in education however there be relatively few such political constituency and a have be point out there be seldom a clear-cut distinction between the educational interest of one social class and those of another another public interest group be the commission of layman or educator which be appoint to study an educational problem and to make recommendation generally these commission work earnestly to represent the interest of the entire society a they conceive it nevertheless they conclusion and recommendation can not please everybody and they often represent a particular economic or political point of view for instance there have be two presidential commission on high education since world war 2 president truman s commission on high education tend to take a liberal expansionist position while president eisenhower s committee on education beyond the high school be slightly more conservative both commission consist of upper-middle - and upper-class people who attempt to act in the public interest an example of a more definite class bias be note in proceeding of the commission on the finance of high education sponsor by the association of american university and support by the rockefeller foundation and the carnegie corporation this commission recommend against the use of federal government fund for the assistance of private university and against a broad program of government-supported scholarship this might be say to be an upper - or an upper-middle-class bias but the commission publish a one of it staff study a book by byron s hollingshead entitle who should go to college which recommend a federal government scholarship program furthermore the commission set up the council for financial aid to education a a mean of encourage private business to increase it support of private high education thus the commission act with a sense of social responsibility within the area of it own conviction about the problem of government support to private education then there be the trustee and officer of the great educational foundation who inevitably exert an influence on educational decision by they support or refusal to support various educational program experiment and demonstration these people be practically always upper - or upper-middle-class person who attempt to act in what they regard a the interest of the entire society finally there be the parent organization and the layman s organization such a the national association of parent and teacher and the citizen committee on public school these have an upper-middle-class leadership and a middle-class membership with rare exception where working-class parent be active in local p-ta matter like the other policy-making group these be middle class in they educational attitude and they attempt to act in the general public interest a they see it in general it appear that educational decision and educational policy be make by people who intend to act in the interest of the society a a whole they be predominantly middle - and upper-class people and undoubtedly share the value and attitude of those class they may be unaware of the existence of lower-class value and consequently fail to take they into account but there be very little frank and conscious espousal of the interest of any one social class by the people who have the power to make decision in education they think of themselves a trustee for the entire society and try to serve the entire society attempt to influence social structure through education educational policy in the unite state have a an explicit goal the maximization of economic and cultural opportunity in so far a this goal be achieve the society become more fluid artificial barrier to social mobility be reduce and people at the low end of the social hierarchy share more fully in the material and cultural goods of society on the other hand there be a counterbalance purpose in education which be to pass on the advantage of the parent to they child this lead to effort at exclusiveness through private school and to the maintenance of social stratification in the school both of these purpose exist side by side without much overt conflict under present condition maximize economic and cultural opportunity the broad expansion of free education result both in raise the average economic and cultural level of the society and in promote fluidity within the social structure fifty year ago the general raise of the school-leaving age to sixteen be an example of this movement during the past decade the program have be carry on through expansion of free high education in state university state college and community college the reaffirmation of american faith in the comprehensive high school a express in the conant study be another indication of the liveliness of the ideal of maximize opportunity through the equalize of educational opportunity the recent federal government s student-loan program be another step in the direction of make high education more available to lower-status youth it be probably more effective than the expand scholarship program of the past decade because the scholarship program mainly aid the student with the good academic record who be usually middle-class and these student tend to use the scholarship fund to go to more expensive college meanwhile the private college have increase they tuition rate so much that they have raise an economic barrier which dwarf they scholarship fund the gain in educational opportunity during the past decade have take place largely in the publicly support institution
