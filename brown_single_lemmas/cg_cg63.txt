in the imagination of the nineteenth century the greek tragedian and shakespeare stand side by side they affinity transcend all the immense contrariety of historical circumstance religious belief and poetic form we no long use the particular term of less and victor hugo but we abide by they insight the word tragedy enclose for we in a single span both the greek and the elizabethan example the sense of relationship overreach the historical truth that shakespeare may have know next to nothing of the actual work of aeschylus sophocles and euripides it transcend the glare fact that the elizabethan mix tragedy and comedy whereas the greek keep the two mode severely distinct it overcome we emphatic awareness of the vast difference in the shape and fabric of the two language and style of dramatic presentation the intimation of a relate spirit and order of human value be strong than any sense of disparity comparable vision of life be at work in antigone and romeo and juliet we see at once what victor hugo mean when he call macbeth a northern scion of the house of atreus elsinore seem to lie in a range of mycenae and the fate of orestes resound in that of hamlet the hound of hell search out they quarry in apollo s sanctuary a they do in the tent of richard 3 oedipus and lear attain similar insight by virtue of similar blindness it be not between euripides and shakespeare that the western mind turn away from the ancient tragic sense of life it be after the late seventeenth century i say the late seventeenth century because racine whom less do not really know stand on the far side of the chasm the image of man which enter into force with aeschylus be still vital in phedre and athalie it be the triumph of rationalism and secular metaphysic which mark the point of no return shakespeare be close to sophocles than he be to pope and voltaire to say this be to set aside the realness of time but it be true nevertheless the mode of the imagination implicit in athenian tragedy continue to shape the life of the mind until the age of descartes and newton it be only then that the ancient habit of feel and the classic ordering of material and psychological experience be abandon with the discours de la methode and the principia the thing undreamt of in horatio s philosophy seem to pass from the world in greek tragedy a in shakespeare mortal action be encompass by force which transcend man the reality of orestes entail that of the fury the weird sister wait for the soul of macbeth we can not conceive of oedipus without a sphinx nor of hamlet without a ghost the shadow cast by the personage of greek and shakespearean drama lengthen into a great darkness and the entirety of the natural world be party to the action the thunderclap over the sacred wood at colonus and the storm in king lear be cause by more than weather in tragedy lightning be a messenger but it can no long be so once benjamin franklin the incarnation of the new rational man have fly a kite to it the tragic stage be a platform extend precariously between heaven and hell those who walk on it may encounter at any turn minister of grace or damnation oedipus and lear instruct we how little of the world belong to man mortality be the pace of a brief and dangerous watch and to all sentinel whether at elsinore or on the battlement at mycenae the come of dawn have it breath of miracle it banish the night wanderer to fire or repose but at the touch of hume and voltaire the noble or hideous visitation which have haunt the mind since agamemnon s blood cry out for vengeance disappear altogether or take tawdry refuge among the gaslight of melodrama modern rooster have lose the art of crow restless spirit back to purgatory in athens in shakespeare s england and at versailles the hierarchy of worldly power be stable and manifest the wheel of social life spin around the royal or aristocratic centre from it spoke of order and degree lead to the outward rim of the common man tragedy presume such a configuration it sphere be that of royal court dynastic quarrel and vault ambition the same metaphor of swift ascent and calamitous decline apply to oedipus and macbeth because they apply also to alcibiades and essex and the fate of such man have tragic relevance because it be public agamemnon creon and medea perform they tragic action before the eye of the polis similarly the suffering of hamlet othello or phedre engage the fortune of the state they be enact at the heart of the body politic hence the natural set of tragedy be the palace gate the public square or the court chamber greek and elizabethan life and to a certain extent the life of versailles share this character of intense publicity prince and faction clash in the open street and die on the open scaffold with the rise to power of the middle class the centre of gravity in human affair shift from the public to the private the art of defoe and richardson be found on an awareness of this great change heretofore an action have possess the breadth of tragedy only if it involve high personage and if it occur in the public view behind the tragic hero stand the chorus the crowd or the observant courtier in the eighteenth century there emerge for the first time the notion of a private tragedy or nearly for the first time there have be a small number of elizabethan domestic tragedy such a the famous arden of feversham in la nouvelle-heloise and werther tragedy be make intimate and private tragedy become the choose ground not of drama but of the new unfold art of the novel the novel be not only the presenter of the new secular rationalistic private world of the middle class it serve also a a literary form exactly appropriate to the fragment audience of modern urban culture i have say before how difficult it be to make any precise statement with regard to the character of the greek and elizabethan public but one major fact seem undeniable until the advent of rational empiricism the control habit of the western mind be symbolic and allegoric available evidence regard the natural world the course of history and the variety of human action be translate into imaginative design or mythology classic mythology and christianity be such architecture of the imagination they order the manifold level of reality and moral value along an axis of be which extend from brute matter to the immaculate star there have not yet superven between understand and expression the new language of mathematics and scientific formula the poet be by definition a realist he imagining and parable be natural organization of reality and in these organization certain primal notion play a radiant part radiant both in the sense of give light and of be a pole toward which all perspective converge i mean such concept a the presence of the supernatural in human affair the sacrament of grace and divine retribution the idea of preordainment the oracle over oedipus the prophecy of the witch to macbeth or god s covenant with he people in athalie i refer to the notion that the structure of society be a microcosm of the cosmic design and that history conform to pattern of justice and chastisement a if it be a morality play set in motion by the god for we instruction these conception and the manner in which they be transpose into poetry or engender by poetic form be intrinsic to western life from the time of aeschylus to that of shakespeare and although they be a i have indicate under increase strain at the time of racine they be still alive in he theatre they be the essential force behind the convention of tragedy they be a decisively present in the oresteia and oedipus a in macbeth king lear and phedre after the seventeenth century the audience cease to be an organic community to which these idea and they attendant habit of figurative language would be natural or immediately familiar concept such a grace damnation purgation blasphemy or the chain of be which be everywhere implicit in classic and shakespearean tragedy lose they vitality they become philosophic abstraction of a private and problematic relevance or mere catchword in religious custom which have in they a diminish part of active belief after shakespeare the master spirit of western consciousness be no long the blind seer the poet or orpheus perform he art in the face of hell they be descartes newton and voltaire and they chronicler be not the dramatic poet but the prose novelist the romantic be the immediate inheritor of this tremendous change they be not yet prepare to accept it a irremediable rousseau s primitivism the anti-newtonian mythology of blake coleridge s organic metaphysic victor hugo s image of the poet a the magi and shelley s unacknowledged legislator be relate element in the rear-guard action fight by the romantic against the new scientific rationalism from this action spring the idea of somehow unite greek and shakespearean drama into a new total form capable of restore to life the ancient moral and poetic response the dream of achieve a synthesis between the sophoclean and the shakespearean genius inspire the ambition of poet and composer from the time of shelley and victor hugo to that of bayreuth it could not really be fulfil the convention into which the romantic try to breath life no long correspond to the reality of think and feel but the attempt itself produce a number of brilliant work and these form a transition from the early romantic period to the new age of ibsen and chekhov the wedding of the hellenic to the northern genius be one of the dominant motif in goethe s think he italian journey be a poet s version of those perennial thrust across the alp of the german emperor of the middle age the dream of a descent into the garden of the south always draw german ambition toward rome and sicily goethe ask in wilhelm meister whether we know the land where the lemon tree flower and the light of the mediterranean glow through torquato tasso and the roman elegy goethe believe that the germanic spirit with it grave strength but flagrant streak of brutality and intolerance should be temper with the old sensuous wisdom and humanism of the hellenic on the narrow ground of poetic form he feel that in the drama of the future the greek conception of tragic fate should be join to the shakespearean vision of tragic will the wager between god and satan bring on the destiny of faust but faust assume he role voluntarily the third act of faust 2 be a formal celebration of the union between the germanic and the classic between the spirit of euripides and that of romantic drama the motif of faust s love for helen of troy go back to the source of the faustian legend it tell we of the ancient human desire to see the high wisdom join to the high sensual beauty there can be no great magic than to wrest from death she in whom the flesh be all in whom beauty be entirely pure because it be entirely corruptible it be thus that the brightness of helen pass through marlowe s faustus goethe use the fable to more elaborate end faust rescue helen from menelaus vengeance be the genius of renaissance europe restore to life the classic tradition the necromantic change from the palace at sparta to faust s gothic castle direct we to the aesthetic mean of the myth the translation of antique drama into shakespearean and romantic guise this translation or rather the fusion of the two ideal create the gesamtkunstwerke the total art form
