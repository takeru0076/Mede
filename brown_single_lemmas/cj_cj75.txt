furthermore it have make an exact assessment of the removal mechanism possible the instrument be show in fig 1 and consist essentially of a hard sharp tungsten carbide knife which be push along the substrate to remove the coat the force require to accomplish removal be plot by mean of an electronic recorder against distance of removal since the removal force be a function of coat thickness a differential transformer pickup have be incorporate into the instrument to accurately measure film thickness this too be record against distance by a repeat run over the same track previously cut a number of adjustment feature be include in the hesiometer to facilitate measurement and permit ready removal of coating deposit on such substrate a iron and other metal glass wood and plastic surface the measurement of topcoat on primer can also readily be carry out hesiometer result have be find to compare excellently with manual knife scratch test the instrumental method however be about 100 time more sensitive and yield numerical result which can be accurately repeat at will over a period of time if a wedge-shaped coat of increase thickness be remove from a substrate by an instrument like the hesiometer with a knife of constant rake angle a number of removal mechanism be often observe which depend upon the thickness of the coat at low thickness a cut or shear phenomenon be often encounter a the coat become thick the cut may abruptly change to a crack type of failure if the coat become still thick a peel type failure finally can occur the typical appearance of these various mechanism be illustrate in fig 2 3 and 4 which be single frame enlargement of high speed movie take during the course of the knife removal process it can be see from fig 2 that the cut removal of a coat from it substrate involve pure cohesive failure of the coat the molecular force hold the coat to the substrate be obviously great than the cohesive strength of the coat and failure occur by shear along a plane start at the tip of the knife and extend to the coat surface the picture of fig 3 and 4 show the crack and peel type of removal where the coat be detach by failure in a region at or close to the interface between coat and substrate if the force require to remove the coating be plot against film thickness a graph a illustrate schematically in fig 5 may characteristically result here h be the coating removal force measure parallel to the surface of the substrate and t be the film thickness it can be see that the force be characteristic of the removal process and change abruptly from cut to crack to peel removal also it can be readily see that the cut and peel type of failure show a steady state response while the crack mechanism be of a dynamic nature it should be recall that these three mechanism can occur on the same coat deposit upon the same substrate merely a a function of change in coating thickness presumably the interfacial bond strength and gross cohesive property be identical in each case what then be the factor that contribute to these phenomenon why should the practical adhesion of a coat a assess by a knife method change initially increase rather rapidly and then decrease stepwise to very low value a the knife be force through a coat of increase thickness cut mechanism of cohesive failure the cut or shear removal process have be previously describe it be find that the coat be separate from it substrate entirely by cohesive failure the detail of the removal process be show schematically in fig 6 the various force result from the reaction of the remove paint chip against the face of the knife and along the shear plane which make an angle \*\* yf with the substrate the action and reaction force be r and afj respectively and be equal and opposite in direction all the other force vector be derive from these afj be the force require to cut a coat of thickness t from the substrate afj be the shear force along the shear plane afj and afj be the thrust force act against coat and knife respectively afj be the normal compressive force act on the shear plane afj be the friction force between chip and knife surface and p be the normal force act on the face of the knife \*\* yc be the rake angle of the knife \*\* yf be the angle the shear plane make with the substrate \*\* yt be the friction angle and \*\* yb be the angle the resultant make with the plane of the substrate an analysis of the vector relationship show that the rake angle \*\* yc and the friction angle \*\* yt determine the vector direction afj of the force resultant r and afj consequently both the rake angle of the knife a well a the friction occur between the back of the remove coat and the front of the knife will determine in large part the detail mechanism of the cut removal process it be difficult to measure the direction and magnitude of r directly in actual practice the value most readily amenable to measurement be the cut force afj and the shear angle afj these two value and the rake angle \*\* yc be sufficient to determine the other parameter of these relationship \*\* yc be define by the geometry of the knife \*\* yf can readily be determine by measure the thickness of the coat before and after cut from the substrate afj be instrumentally determine from fig 6 the relationship between these parameter can readily be derive and the cut force be afj where \*\* yl be the shear strength of the coat and be a parameter of the coating material w be the width of the remove coat and t be it thickness if the cut force afj be plot against film thickness a straight line should result pass through the origin and have slope afj however in the actual assessment of the cut force by instrumental method for any thickness of coat a number of spurious effect occur which must be take into account and which make the measure value large than the true cut force indicate by eqn 1 blunt knife one of these be the fact that the knife employ no matter how well sharpen will have a slightly round cut edge this signify that \*\* yc the rake angle be no long a constant to zero film thickness the curvature of this bluntness be in the case of the carboloy knife employ in the hesiometer determine by the grain size of the polish grit and the tungsten carbide crystal cement together in the knife body and be in the order of 01 to 02 mil the force vector concept of fig 6 can readily be apply to this condition also because the rake angle afj at the tip of the knife be very much small or even negative when compare to the value of \*\* yc for the major portion of the knife a very rapid increase in cut force with thickness will result this reduce to the relationship afj where afj be the intercept at zero thickness of the extrapolation of the slope indicate in eqn 1 afj be the thickness of the coat equivalent to the round off of the knife tip afj be a straight line first approximation of this roundness and the other symbol be equivalent to those of eqn 1 it can be see that afj be a constant and be determine for the most part by the geometry of the knife the blunt the knife the high be the value of afj the importance of a hard abrasion-resistant knife material like the carboloy employ in the hesiometer immediately become apparent soft knife would blunt very rapidly make the value of afj inexact in extreme case of very soft knife this value may even change during the course of a measurement knife friction a second factor which enter into the practical measurement of the instrumentally determine cut force be the frictional resistance cause by the bottom of the knife against the substrate this be not a constant value like afj but vary with the thickness of the coat and the direction and magnitude of the resultant r and afj of fig 6 under equilibrium condition of cut the chip exert a thrust afj against the knife which tend to push it into the substrate or lift it away from the substrate depend on the vector direction of afj the resultant friction force afj be thus directly proportional to afj and consequently also to film thickness the value of afj can readily be assess by determine the frictional force exert on the knife while run over the previously strip coat track under various external loading a straight line relationship be usually observe in a plot of afj against load l have slope k and afj since the load l under actual cut condition be cause by afj it can be see that afj the measure force h in cut removal of coating from they substrate consequently can be see to be the sum of that force require to cut the coat afj that due to the bluntness of the knife afj and that due to the friction between the bottom of the knife and the substrate afj or afj the first two force be directly interrelate and depend upon film thickness whereas afj be independent of these two and be a constant for a give knife combination these theoretical relationship be more clearly illustrate in fig 7 and they sum can be see to correlate in form with practical measurement make with the hesiometer a illustrate in the first portion of fig 5 for the cut mechanism chip mechanism of cohesive failure although a large number of coating system particularly at low thickness fail cohesively by the cut mechanism frequently a second type of cohesive failure may also take place this be a chip dynamic type failure encounter with very brittle coating resin or very highly pigmented film this be show in the photomicrograph of fig 8 the basic difference between the continuous cut mechanism and that of the chip mechanism be that instead of shear occur in the coat ahead of the knife continuously without fracture rupture intermittently occur along the shear plane the detail mechanism of this type of failure have be study extensively by merchant for metal cut and the principle find can be directly apply to coating by study high speed movie make of this type of failure the sequence of relationship a schematically illustrate in fig 9 could be observe in the first picture 9a the knife be just begin to advance into the incline surface which be leave from the previous chip formation in the next the shear plane angle be high and extend to the incline work surface with increase advance of the knife into the coat the shear plane extend to the coating surface and the shear angle rapidly decrease eventually rupture occur along the shear plane 9e and the cycle repeat itself merchant have find that the same basic relationship which describe the geometry and force system in the case of the cut mechanism can also be apply to the discontinuous chip formation provide the proper value of instantaneous shear angle and instantaneous chip thickness or cross-sectional area be use consequently if the shear angle \*\* yf be replace by the rupture angle afj the relationship a describe in eqn 1 2 4 and 6 will directly apply the crack mechanism under equilibrium cut condition the chip exert a force afj against the coat and an equal opposite force afj against the knife in the plane of the substrate a show in fig 6 if the rake angle \*\* yc of the knife be high enough and the friction angle \*\* yt between the front of the knife and the back of the chip be low enough to give a positive value for afj the resultant vector r will lie above the plane of the substrate
