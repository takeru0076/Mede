too many people think that the primary purpose of a high education be to help you make a live this be not so for education offer all kind of dividend include how to pull the wool over a husband s eye while you be have an affair with he wife if it be not for an old professor who make i read the classic i would have be stymied on what to do and now i understand why they be classic those who write they know people and what make people tick i work for i uncle an uncle by marriage so you will not think this have a mild undercurrent of incest who run one of those antique shop in new orleans vieux carre the old french quarter the arrangement i have with he be to work four hour a day the rest of the time i devote to painting or to those other activity a young and healthy man just out of college find interest i have a one-room studio which overlook an ancient courtyard fill with flower and plant bloom everlastingly in the southern sun i have come to new orleans two year early after graduate college partly because i love the city and partly because there be quite a note art colony there when i uncle offer i a part-time job which would take care of i normal expense and give i time to paint i accept the arrangement turn out to be excellent i love the city and i particularly love the gaiety and spirit of mardi gra i have see two of they and we would soon be in another city-wide joyous celebration with romance in the air and when you take a walk you never know what adventure or pair of sparkle eye be wait around the next corner the very face of the people bear this expectation of fun and pleasure it be a if they could hardly wait to get into they costume cover they face with mask and go adventure i uncle and i be not too close socially because of the difference in we age sometimes i wonder vaguely what he do about woman for i aunt by blood have die some year ago but neither of we say anything one monday morning i see he approach the store with a woman and introduce i to she a i new aunt they be marry over the week-end though he be easily sixty and she could not have be even thirty she look more like twenty-five or six it be really a may and december combination i new aunt be perhaps three or four year old than i and it have be a long time since i have see a gorgeous a woman who ooze sex there be something about the contour of she face she smile that be like new orleans sunshine the way she hold she head the way she walk there be scarcely anything she do which do not fascinate i she leg be the full sexy kind full body like a rare wine and just a tantalize to the appetite the calf be magnificent the ankle perfect you must forgive i if i seem to dwell too much on she physical aspect but i be an artist accustom to study the physical body the true artist be like one of those scientist who from a single bone can reconstruct an animal s entire body the artist look at an ankle a calf a bosom and in he mind s eye the clothe drop away and he see she a she really be and that be the way i first see she when i uncle bring she into he antique store that she impress i instantly be obvious i be aware that when we eye meet we both quickly avert they i think i see a faint surge of color rise to she neck and quickly suffuse she cheek true she be i aunt marry to an uncle relate to i only by marriage but why she have marry a man twice she age and more perhaps i do not know or much care she be stand with she back to the glass door she form be silhouette and with the strong light i could see the outline of she body a body that an artist or anyone else would have admire a it be in so many affair of the heart a man and a woman meet and something click something click in this instance but i treat she circumspectly and i feel that she know it for we both keep we distance when she appear at the store to help out for a few hour even i look at she be surreptitious lest i uncle notice it and then i become aware that she too glance at i surreptitiously i feel that she eye be undress i a if she be a painter and i a nude model i dismiss these feeling a wishful think but i could not get it out of i head that we have a strong physical attraction for one another and we both fear to dwell on it because of we relationship when we eye meet the air be fill with an unuttered message of i too you have probably experience this it be nothing you can put you finger on but the air suddenly fill with a high charge of electricity why she marry he i do not know i myself be fond of he but what a young woman half he age see in he be a mystery to i he already have that slow pace that come over the elderly while she herself have all the sign of one who appreciate the joy of live perhaps with i uncle she find a measure of economic security that she need or maybe she like man old enough to be she father some woman with father fixation do for several week we eye one another almost like spar partner and then one day uncle be slightly indisposed and stay home he bride open the store i be wait in front of it when she show up and tell i of i uncle s indisposition even a she be tell i about it i become aware of a give-away flush that suffuse she neck and move upwards to she cheek and subconsciously i realize that when she enter the store she do not switch on the light the cavernous depth clutter with antique echo to she hard heel a she walk directly to the office in the rear and take the seat at he desk she place she palm finger outspread on the desk in an odd gesture a if to say now what next i be aware of a humid look in she eye that tell i the time be opportune there be little likelihood of any customer walk in at that hour i be stand beside she watch the outspread palm and wonder about the old horsehair sofa against the wall on which he sometimes nap i bend and kiss the still pink neck and suddenly she jump up and she two arm encircle i in a bear-like crush she mouth which have be so much in i thought be warm and moist and tender i hear she murmur we d good lock the door it do not take i long to slip the bolt securely and return to the rear and it couch when we open the door again for business and switch on the light she say he will not always be indisposed i know i be think about that how will we work it out i do nt know she say you re the man you figure it out i ve notice the way you ve be look at i ever since we meet i guess we both feel it i say i guess so she say but now what even a i say it i realize that an education can be invaluable i know what we can do i say tell he i make a pass at you she raise a protest hand with a startle air what be you try to do get throw out if i even hint at it do you think it will matter that you be he nephew and not even a blood nephew i do nt want to be throw out and i do nt think i will i think i have a way so we can carry on without he suspect we by tell he you be make pass at i she say incredulously when i be in college i grin i remember a poem i have to read in i light class i do nt even remember who write it but it be one of those 15th or 16th century poet in those day poem often tell a story in verse and those boy have some corker to tell and now i think we can use the knowledge they pass on to we tomorrow mardi gra open officially a lot of people will roam the street in costume and mask and have a ball there will be romance and flirtation if you tell he i make a pass at you he might think you misunderstand something i say or do so instead of just tell he i make a pass say i try to date you and that you agree so you could prove to he what a louse i really be we make a rendezvous tomorrow even at nine on some street near lake ponchartrain and to prove what you tell he about i you suggest that he keep the date instead you be both the same size he could use you clothe for a costume and a heavy veil for a mask when i show up he will know you be a good wife to have tell he about it but you she begin do nt worry about i it will turn out all right i do nt understand she insist be you try to cut you throat no i chuckle i m just begin to collect dividend on i investment in education a we expect on the follow day i uncle be completely recover and open the store a usual at 10 in the morning i feel that he look at i coldly and appraisingly and seem to be uncertain what he attitude towards i should be but he do not say one word which might indicate that he have be tell of advance to he wife i quit work at i usual hour a if this day be no different from other day i hear subsequently that i uncle and aunt have dinner in a nearby restaurant in the french quarter after which he go home to get into he costume to keep the date shortly before nine i drive i jalopy to the street face the lake and park the car in shadow far enough away from the rendezvous corner but near enough to keep the corner in clear view a few minute late i see i uncle s car drive up and a woman s figure emerge and walk to the corner i must say the figure be well make up if it be not that i know who it be i could have mistake it for i aunt so well do she clothe fit he in one hand he grip firmly a parasol though there have be no indication of rain i suspect why he bring it along in the half darkness i approach cautiously make sure he do not see i he be look out on the dark water of the lake when i come upon he and without waste word i smack he hard across the face you cheap bitch i exclaim you cheap no good two-timing bitch you get a good loyal husband smack and you fall for a pass by he own nephew you should smack be ashamed of yourself
