i do not mean to suggest that these assumption be self-evident in the sense that everyone agree with they if they be walter lippmann would be write the same column a george sokolsky and herb lock would have nothing to draw cartoon about i do mean however that i take they for grant and that everything i shall be say would appear quite idiotic against any contrary assumption assumption 1 the ultimate objective of american policy be to help establish a world in which there be the large possible measure of freedom and justice and peace and material prosperity and in particular since this be we special responsibility that these condition be enjoy by the people of the unite state i speak of the large possible measure because any person who suppose that these condition can be universally and perfectly achieve ever reckon without the inherent imperfectability of himself and he fellow human being and be therefore a dangerous man to have around assumption 2 these condition be unobtainable be not even approachable in the qualify sense i have indicate without the prior defeat of world communism this be true for two reason because communism be both doctrinally and in practice antithetical to these condition and because communist have the will and a long a soviet power remain intact the capacity to prevent they realization moreover a communist power increase the enjoyment of these condition throughout the world diminish pro rata and the possibility of they restoration become increasingly remote assumption 3 it follow that victory over communism be the dominant proximate goal of american policy proximate in the sense that there be more distant more positive end we seek to which victory over communism be but a mean but dominant in the sense that every other objective no matter how worthy intrinsically must defer to it peace be a worthy objective but if we must choose between peace and keep the communist out of berlin then we must fight freedom in the sense of self-determination be a worthy objective but if grant self-determination to the algerian rebel entail sweep that area into the sino-soviet orbit then algerian freedom must be postpone justice be a worthy objective but if justice for bantus entail drive the government of the union of south africa away from the west then the bantus must be prepare to carry they identification card yet a while long prosperity be a worthy objective but if provide high standard of live get in the way of produce sufficient gun to resist communist aggression then material sacrifice and denial will have to be make it may be of course that such objective can be pursue consisently with a policy design to overthrow communism i point be that where conflict arise they must always be resolve in favor of achieve the indispensable condition for a tolerant world the absence of soviet communist power the use of power this much have be say the question remain whether we have the resource for the job we have to do defeat communism and if so how those resource ought to be use this bring we squarely to the problem of power and the use a nation make of power i submit that this be the key problem of international relation that it always have be that it always will be and i suggest far that the main cause of the trouble we be in have be the failure of american policy-maker ever since we assume free world leadership in 1945 to deal with this problem realistically and seriously in the recent political campaign two charge be leveled affect the question of power and i think we might begin by try to put they into proper focus one be demonstrably false the other for the most part true the first be that america have become or be in danger of become a second-rate military power i know i do not have to dwell here on the absurdity of that contention you may have misgiving about certain aspect of we military establishment i certainly do but you know any comparison of over-all american strength with over-all soviet strength find the unite state not only superior but so superior both in present weapon and in the development of new one that we advantage promise to be a permanent feature of us-soviet relation for the foreseeable future i have often search for a graphic way of impress we superiority on those american who have doubt and i think mr jameson campaigne have do it well in he new book american might and soviet myth suppose he say that the table be turn and we be in the soviet position there would be more than 2000 modern soviet fighter all good than ours station at 250 base in mexico and the caribbean overwhelming russian naval power would always be within a few hundred mile of we coast half of the population of the we would be need to work on arm just to feed the people add this to the unrest in the country around we where oppress people would be ready to turn on we at the first opportunity add also a comparatively primitive industrial plant which would severely limit we capacity to keep abreast of the soviet even in the missile field which be repute to be we main strength if we look at the situation this way we can get an idea of khrushchev s nightmarish worry or at least of the worry he might have if he enemy be dispose to exploit they advantage we prestige the other charge be that america s political position in the world have progressively deteriorate in recent year the contention need to be formulate with much great precision than it ever be during the campaign but once that have be do i fail to see how any serious student of world affair can quarrel with it the argument be typically advance in term of we prestige prestige however be only a minor part of the problem and even then it be a concept that can be highly mislead prestige be a measure of how other people think of you well or ill but contrary to what be imply during the campaign prestige be surely not important for it own sake only the vain and incurably sentimental among we will lose sleep simply because foreign people be not a impress by we strength a they ought to be the thing to lose sleep over be what people have conclude that we be weak than we be be likely to do about it the evidence suggest that foreign people believe the unite state be weak than the soviet union and be bind to fall still far behind in the year ahead this ignorant estimate i repeat be not of any interest in itself but it become very important if foreign people react the way human being typically do namely by take step to end up on what appear to be the win side to the extent then that decline we prestige mean that other nation will be tempt to place they bet on an ultimate american defeat and will thus be more vulnerable to soviet intimidation there be reason for concern still these guess about the outcome of the struggle can not be a important a the actual power relationship between the soviet union and ourselves here i do not speak of military power where we advantage be obvious and overwhelming but of political power of influence if you will about which the relevant question be be soviet influence throughout the world great or less than it be ten year ago and be western influence great or less than it use to be communist gain in answer these question we need to ask not merely whether communist troop have cross over into territory they do not occupy before and not merely whether discipline agent of the cominform be in control of government from which they be formerly exclude the success of communism s war against the west do not depend on such spectacular and definitive conquest success may mean merely the displacement of western influence communist political warfare we must remember be wage insidiously and in deliberate stage fearful of invite a military showdown with the west which they could not win the communist seek to undermine western power where the nuclear might of the west be irrelevant in backwoods guerrilla skirmish in mob uprising in the street in parliament in clandestine meeting of undercover conspirator at the unite nation on the propaganda front at diplomatic conference preferably at the high level the soviet understand moreover that the first step in turn a country toward communism be to turn it against the west thus typically the first stage of a communist takeover be to neutralize a country the second stage be to retain the nominal classification of neutralist while in fact turn the country into an active advocate and adherent of soviet policy and this may be a far a the process will go the kremlin s goal be the isolation and capture not of ghana but of the unite state and this purpose may be serve very well by country that masquerade under a neutralist mask yet in fact be dependable auxiliary of the soviet foreign office to recite the particulars of recent soviet success be hardly reassure six year ago french indochina though in troubie be in the western camp today northern vietnam be overtly communist laos be teeter between communism and pro-communist neutralism cambodia be for all practical purpose neutralist indonesia in the early day of the republic lean toward the west today sukarno s government be heavily besiege by avow communist and for all of it neutralist pretension it be a firm ally of soviet policy ceylon have move from a pro-western orientation to a neutralism openly hostile to the west in the middle east iraq syria and egypt be a short while ago in the western camp today the nasser and kassem government be adamantly hostile to the west be dependent for they military power on soviet equipment and personnel in almost every particular follow the kremlin s foreign policy line a short time ago all africa be a western preserve never mind whether the kikiyus and the bantus enjoy wilsonian self-determination the point be that in the struggle for the world that vast land mass be under the domination and influence of the west today africa be swerve violently away from the west and plunge it would seem into the soviet orbit latin america be once an area a safe for the west a nebraska be for nixon today it be up for grab one latin american country cuba have become a soviet bridgehead ninety mile off we coast in some country the trend have go far than other mexico panama and venezuela be display open sympathy for castroism and there be no country save the dominican republic whose funeral service we recently arrange where castroism and anti-americanism do not prevent the government from unqualifiedly espouse the american cause only in europe have we line remain firm and there only on the surface the strain of neutralism be run strong notably in england and even in germany opportunity miss what have we to show by way of counter-successes we have have opportunity clear invitation to plant we influence on the other side of the iron curtain there be the hungarian revolution which we praise and mourn but do nothing about there be the polish revolution which we misunderstand and then help guide along a course favorable to soviet interest there be the revolution in tibet which we pretend do not exist only in one instance have we move purposively and effectively to dislodge exist communist power in guatemala and contrary to what have be say recently we do not wait for outside pressure and world opinion to bring down that communist government we move decisively to effect an anti-communist coup detat we serve we national interest and by so do we save the guatemalan people the ultimate in human misery
