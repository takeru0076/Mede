a reason for select mail questionnaire method there be two method that could have be use for conduct the study within the resource available 1 interview in depth with a few select company and 2 the more limit interrogation of a large number of company by mean of a mail questionnaire while the method of interview a small number of company be appeal because of the opportunity it might have furnish to probe fully the reason and circumstance of a company s practice and opinion it also involve the risk of pay undue attention to the unique and peculiar problem of just a few individual company a a result it be decide that a mail questionnaire send to a large number of company would be more effective in determine the general practice and opinion of small firm and in highlight some of the fundamental and recur problem of defense procurement that concern both industry and government it be also hope that response to a mail questionnaire would suggest fruitful inquiry that might be make in subsequent study of a more detail nature it be recognize that a mail questionnaire have inherent limitation there be the danger that the question will mean different thing to different respondent simple yes or no answer do not reveal the different shade of opinion that the various respondent may have a respondent may want to make alternative answer because he do not know the precise circumstance assume in the question there be also the problem of the respondent s frame of reference be the respondent make a recommendation for he own benefit for the benefit of he industry for the benefit of a specific government department or service for the benefit of the defense program for the benefit of small business or for the benefit of the taxpayer there be also the question of whether the respondent base he answer on factual information and carefully consider judgment or whether he answer be casual guess finally there be the question of how strongly an express opinion be hold whether it be a firm opinion or one that the respondent favor only slightly over the alternative the research team be very mindful of these danger and limitation of a mail questionnaire under the circumstance however the team consider it would provide the most useful information at this point in the preparation of the questionnaire the problem note above be carefully consider and the structure and phraseology use be design to minimize the effect of these limitation b design of the questionnaire the questionnaire be design to elicit three type of information 1 the fact regard certain characteristic of the respondent include they experience with and interest in secure defense business 2 the actual sell and buy practice of the respondent and 3 the attitude and opinion of the
