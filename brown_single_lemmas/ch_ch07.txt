on may 31 all of it city close they fiscal year on december 31 the remain twelve state have vary fiscal year for the state city and local government however only illinois oregon louisiana and rhode island have a situation in which the sundry unit of government vary widely in relation to fiscal uniformity fiscal uniformity advantage and disadvantage advantage an excellent summary of advantage concern the uniform fiscal year and coordinate fiscal calendar be contain in a paper present by a public finance authority recently he list among the value of fiscal uniformity 1 the uniform fiscal year require compliance with common sense administration of local finance adoption of the budget or financial plan in advance of spend 2 the uniform fiscal year ensure conformance with another common sense rule that of have cash in the bank before check be draw it enable town to make more economical purchase and to take advantage of cash discount 3 the uniform fiscal year promote more careful budgeting and strengthen control over expenditure by fix the tax rate in advance of spend upper limit be set on expenditure 4 the uniform fiscal year bring the town s fiscal year into line with that of the school which expend the large share of local disbursement this greatly simplify the town s bookkeeping and financial report 5 the uniform fiscal year eliminate interest charge on money borrow in the form of tax anticipation note furthermore tax collection not immediately need for current expenditure may be invest in short-term treasury note augment the town s miscellaneous revenue and reduce the tax levy 6 the uniform fiscal year facilitate inter-town comparison of revenue and expenditure when town have the same fiscal year it be relatively easy to make meaningful comparison and a the cost of local government increase the demand for such comparison also increase town have different fiscal year be difficult to compare of all advantage probably none be more important than the elimination of tax anticipation note borrow in anticipation of current tax and other revenue be a routine procedure of the majority of municipality at all time it may be by bank loan sale of note or warrant or by the somewhat casual method of issuance and registration of warrant in any event it be a form of borrow which could be and should be render unnecessary it elimination would result in the save of interest cost heavy when short-term money rate be high and in freedom from dependence on credit which be not always available when need most this type of borrow can be reduce to a minimum if quarterly installment payment of tax be institute and the first payment place near the open of the fiscal year any approach toward such a system look toward save and security it should be note that there be other and equally important reason for establish meaningful intergovernmental report base on a uniform fiscal year both the federal and state government commence they fiscal year on july 1 both unit of government contribute increasingly large sum of money to the several local government in this state a indicate below it have be say that when local government revenue be mostly produce locally from the property tax the lack of a uniform fiscal year be no great handicap but with the growth of state and federal fiscal aid the emphasis on equalization and the state-local share of responsibility for certain important function this be no long true the haphazard fiscal year calendar be an obstacle to the plan of clear and efficient state-local revenue and expenditure relationship disadvantage although there be many sound reason for adopt uniform and coordinate fiscal year in rhode island there be also certain difficulty encounter these involve more the mechanic employ in adjust to fiscal uniformity than they do actual disadvantage to the principle one problem be a matter of shift date the other be how to finance the transition little can be do about the change of date this be an inherent part of adjust fiscal calendar it usually mean a confuse and disgruntled tax-paying public for a period of time but cooperation and understand between local official and the citizenry help lessen this problem the other problem be the matter of finance the transition period in the several city and town this will be cover more fully late it should be keep in mind that the ease or difficulty with which a town or city can convert to the propose plan be directly dependent upon the financial condition of that town or city fortunately there be no city or town in the state with one or two possible exception that be in too difficult a position to finance the propose change sacrifice will have to be make in some case but it be to the municipality s advantage to finance the change-over for a short period of time rather than pay interest on tax anticipation note indefinitely adjust the fiscal calendar the advantage of a uniform fiscal year and well synchronize fiscal and tax collection calendar be sufficiently great for rhode island municipality to exert effort to secure they the type of program desire can be determine by the nature and extent of the adjustment need two feature be immediately evident first the present situation be too vary to be systematize by any single formula second the shift to a uniform july 1 to june 30 fiscal year will of itself improve the tax collection calendar of the great majority of city and town there be at least two problem to consider one be a matter of adjust the fiscal calendar the other be how to finance the adjustment when necessary the latter matter be consider in detail in a late section twelve city and town in rhode island presently indicate some plan to establish a uniform and coordinate fiscal tax year calendar plan vary from the talk stage to establish special committee to accomplish this end what be important here be that many of the city and town recognize the need for improve fiscal practice and be take the initiative to obtain they an analysis of the fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout the state indicate that transition may not be a painful a be commonly think however it must be stress that much depend upon the financial condition of the individual city and town involve the adjustment need to establish a uniform and coordinate fiscal tax collection year calendar throughout rhode island base on a july 1 to june 30 year be show below no adjustment need six city and town be presently on a july 1 to june 30 fiscal year and have coordinate they tax collection year with it no change be require for these town these municipality include barrington lincoln middletown newport north kingstown and south kingstown adjustment of fiscal year one town and one city coventry and east providence require an adjustment of they fiscal year only this change will automatically adjust they tax collection year calendar so a to make all tax installment due and payable in the fiscal year collectible within that year adjustment of tax collection year six city and town be now on a july 1 to june 30 fiscal year and will need only to adjust they tax collection year calendar to establish uniformity these city and town include bristol glocester pawtucket cumberland central fall and woonsocket simultaneous adjustment two city to be consider providence and cranston be an enigma both have excellent integration of they fiscal tax collection year calendar however neither of these two city be on the desire july 1 to june 30 fiscal year the adjustment to a uniform and coordinate fiscal period could be accomplish relatively easily for they in that both city end they fiscal year on september 30 they could levy tax for an interim period of nine month commence with september 30 and end with june 30 these three installment date would be october 26 january 26 and april 25 providence and november 15 february 16 and may 15 cranston both would start they new fiscal year on july 1 they tax collection calendar could then be july 25 october 26 january 26 and april 25 providence and august 15 november 15 february 17 and may 15 cranston under this plan both cranston and providence would be on the uniform fiscal year but would still be use the same installment period vary adjustment the remain twenty-three town have fiscal year which end prior to june 30 all of these town will require adjustment of both they fiscal and tax collection year assume an adjustment to the july 1 to june 30 fiscal year the require adjustment of the tax collection year and the town involve be show in table 3 method of finance adjustment aside from the matter of adjust the fiscal and tax calendar there be the problem of finance the adjustment when this be necessary it should be emphasize strongly that adjustment in fiscal date or adoption of interim budget do not necessarily mean finance over and above normal governmental requirement in many community there be simply no financial problem it be only a matter of adjust account method careful fiscal plan and management or some like combination of technique in other municipality the difficulty in overcome the financial burden have be sufficiently great to dishearten proponent of fiscal year change fortunately such case in rhode island be more the exception than the rule a show early in table 1 the several city and town use widely vary fiscal and tax collection calendar in addition no two rhode island community be identical in relation to they over-all financial condition these factor practically insure that no single finance formula be feasible each situation must be study and a plan develop that take into consideration such factor a the effect of the exist and prospective tax calendar the financial condition of the treasury and the length of the transition interval suitable plan range from those that be very easy to develop to those that be difficult to formulate and require borrow range from short-term serial note to long-term bond the financial problem where it exist usually stem from the adoption of a budget for the transitional or adjustment period for those community which have financial difficulty in effect adjustment there be a number of alternative any one of which alone or in combination with other would minimize if not even eliminate the problem
