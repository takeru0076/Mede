anything wrong capn the man seem to think so dirion find a large war party south of we they ll probably attack at dawn montero say he brush past the clergyman and walk into the center of the camp use he hand a a trumpet he shout fort up fort up there s a large war party on they way for a second engage cook voyageurs appear strike dumb then little billy begin shout order to round up the pony and fill the water bucket and for the cook to hurry up with the meal they all fly into action that be a terrible thing to do i say to oso the aricaras treat we like friend and here all the time you know the sioux would be use we rifle on they god what a world you people live in oso give i an unruffled look old knife s get the large war party ever see on the river he say calmly what would you have do in montero s moccasin let old knife come up and kill you and you people or would you steer he on someone else he shake he head mr manuel do that in the war that s why the british never get the tribe to fight for the king mr manuel whisper in the ear of the sioux that the cheyennes be comin to raid em for they horse then he go on to the cheyennes and tell they that the sioux be goin to move up he do that with all the nation hell they be fightin each other so hard they have no time for anyone else the war department write mr manuel a letter and say he be a hero i see that letter he carry it in a little wallet make of fish skin but that be war i say there s no war on now you re wrong matt in this country there s a war on every time the grass turn green first it be the nation against themselves then it be they against the white and it s goin to go on like this year after year until the white people take over this land i remember be tell it would happen so fast people would think it take place overnight that s why this company s important once we get over the mountain other will come along that s why the trust do nt want we to make it that bastard chamber old knife s not the only chief he ll get to do he dirty work before we get through he ll have the blackfeet hankerin for we hair and we goods well talkin ai nt goin to help let s fort up a i dig in behind one of the bale we be use a protection i grudgingly find myself agree with oso s logic especially when i imagine what would have happen to missy if old knife s large party of screech warrior have overrun we company for unlike the sioux and the crow the aricaras be not great horseman nor be they aggressive like the savage blackfeet more of an agricultural nation they have rely on they warrior only for defense and for survival in the endless war of the plain still i be disgust with myself for agree with montero s method surprisingly he have tell the other what he have do in the brief moment i have to talk to they before i take i post on the ring of defense i indicate i be sicken by the method man employ to live and trade on the river i think montero do right amy say firmly let the savage kill each other what do we care reverend jason be understandably bitter it be a terrible thing to do those little child but oso reply calmly trouble ai nt easy to dodge out in this country revrend 28 attack gray eye attack we camp just a the first pink thread stitch together the hill and the sky we camp be in the center of a wide valley montero have set up a strong position use every bale and box we have in addition to barricade of log and brush he have order the pony bring inside the fortify circle and have assign pierre and a band of pick engage the job of try to keep they steady under fire the pony herd be the one flaw in we defense the rees undoubtedly would try to cut down a many of the animal a possible wildly buck horse would make the position difficult to defend against charge warrior the cook have prepare one of the good meal we d have in a long time and on montero s order have bake enough bread to last the day bucket be fill the herd feed and water the bad part have be the wait although we do nt expect the attack before dawn the long cloudy night fill with the sound of the industrious insect seem endless coyote and hunt wolf sound like signale indian scout the whinny of a restless pony make one s skin crawl oso sleep unconcernedly he rifle cradle in he arm i do nt catch a wink every time i close i eye i see gray eye rush at i with a knife it be a relief when they finally come they pour through the open in the valley then spread out in a long line to come at we brandish they lance and fill the morning with they spine-chilling scalp cry oso montero call i ll get gray eye that ll be a pleasure to see the big black murmur a he stare down the barrel of he rifle hold you fire montero be shout wait until i shoot i ll shoot the first man who do nt i could see they in i sight they be about a mile off under i the ground quiver slightly at first they be only feather and dark indistinguishable face and body hunch over they horse head gradually they emerge a man gray eye be in the lead he face be split by a vermilion streak he eye be pool of white jagged red and black medicine symbol cover he chest he be naked except for a clout next to he be a young boy i be sure have sit near i at one of the trade session he mouth be open he neck cord with the strain of he scream i find he chest in i sight it have a red circle the circle come near and near i god how long be he go to wait i think montero s rifle crack at first i think he have miss gray eye remain erect the feather lance be still above he head a he start to slump over another warrior swing he onto he horse i squeeze the trigger at the last second i drop i sight from the bare chest and bright red circle to the chest of he pony i see the pony fall like a stone and the young warrior fly over it head bounce like a rubber ball he start to run but oso s shoot catch he on the wing he jerk once in the grass and lie still if you re goin to kill em kill em oso growl what else he say be lose in the rattle of gunfire on all side the aricaras break under the devastate fire wheel and retreat lead up lead up they ll be back montero be shout far up the valley i could see the rees circle and reorganize out in front of we wall the grass be cover with dead and die man war shield lance blanket and wound and dead horse the morning air be fill with the sweetish odor of new-spilled blood the acrid stench of frighten horse and the bitterness of burn powder a horse scream a it twist from side to side in a frenzy a rifle crack the square head fall over one of the warrior suddenly leap to he foot and begin run across the valley to the tree that line the small creek he leg pump furiously he long black hair stream out behind he there be a rag volley he be dead before he hit the ground for christ s sake do nt waste you powder on one of em montero shout furiously wait for the charge the charge i tell you the sharp cry at the end of the valley be faint they grow loud a the indian charge again i could see they face glisten with sweat and bear grease they mouth open shout they spine-chilling cry gray eye be back montero say the war captain have be badly wound and be fight to hold he seat i could see the blood run down he chest he be ride between two warrior who hold he erect when he start to slump i forget to aim in i sight i watch he loom big and big montero s shoot have catch he high in the chest there be no doubt he be die again we wait for montero this time he delay so long that some of the engage shout frantically but they hold they fire the horse be only several length away when he fire the bullet fling gray eye from he horse we roll volley sweep most of the other rider from they mount but a few reach we wall i hear the whir of an ax and a canadian s face burst apart in a bloody spray i see little billy rise and fire almost point blank and an indian s face become shatter flesh and bone a second leap from he horse to the top of the bale fire four arrow in such rapid succession it do nt seem possible they be in flight man scream oso reach up jerk the buck from the bale and snap he neck other indian be run at the pony shril and wave blanket reverend jason get one the canadian the other i see the clergyman kneel for a moment by the twitch body of the man he have shoot then run back to he position the pony be almost uncontrollable the pall of dust they raise make it difficult to see when the aricaras charge again this time more of they hurdle the barrier a small indian dive at montero who catch he with a swift upward stroke of he rifle butt it sound like a man kick a melon above i a dark rider be whip he pony with a quirt in an attempt to hurdle the bale although i shoot kill he horse he roll off the bale on top of i i could smell woodsmoke grease and oil he eye be dark fluid fearful and he give a sigh a i knife go in come over the wall he have seem like a hideous devil now under i i could see he for what he really be a boy dress up in streak of paint the aricaras make one last desperate charge it be pitiful to see the thin rank of warrior old and young wheel and twist they pony frantically from side to side only to be tumble bleed from they saddle by the relentless slam slam of the cruelly efficient hawkinses other badly wound grip hand in mane knee in belly hold on a long a possible and then weak from ghastly wound slip sideways slowly almost thoughtfully to be break under the slash hoof some gracefully soar from the back of they wound scream mount to make one last defiant charge before the lead split they heart or tear they guts none of they reach we wall again the few survivor grudgingly turn away in the distance we could hear the drum and the wail of the death song
