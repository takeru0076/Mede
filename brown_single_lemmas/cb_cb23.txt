everywhere i go in formosa i ask the same question i be search for an accent of self-delusion or even of hypocrisy i never find it among any of the chinese with whom i speak though grant they be almost all member of the official family who presumably harbor official thought but i question also professional soldier who would not easily be hypnotize by a septuagenarian s dreamy irredentism they answer be it can be do and we will do it and then i put the question a pointedly a i could directly to chiang kai-shek in america i say practically no one believe that you subjectively intend to re-enter the mainland what evidence be there of an objective kind that in fact you government propose to do just that and that it can be do he smile he always smile at least at visitor i gather he smile also at a british bloke seat next to i who ask the most asinine question i recall sympathetically the duke s complaint in brown s i last duchess he smile and say a word or two to the interpreter who turn to i the president wonder where you be go after you leave taipei that i smart be a royal rebuff if ever there be one i answer the routine question about i itinerary rather coolly chiang speak again this time at great length the president say the translator come in that the reason he ask you where you be go be because he hope you would be visit other area in southeast asia and that everywhere you go you would seek the answer to you question he say that if he be to express to you once again he own profound determination to go to the mainland and he faith that that return be feasible he would merely sound redundant so you yourself must seek these objective data and come to you own conclusion any information we have here in taiwan be at you disposal fair enough what be the relevant data for every person on taiwan there be sixty in mainland china if the raw population figure be crucially relevant then it be idle to think of liberation a idle a to suppose that poland might liberate russia relative military manpower less than 60-1 but at least 6-1 the estimate vary widely on the strength of the chinese army say four million the arm force of taiwan be at a work strength of about 450000 though a reserve potential twice that high be contemplate skill train morale it be generally concede that the formosan air force be the good by far in asia and the army the good train the morale be very high even so it add up to impossible odds except that the question arise on whose side would the mainland chinese army fight the miserable people of china the large cast ever conscript to enact an ideological passion play can not themselves resist overtly they think perforce of physical survival everything else be secondary but the army which mao continue to feed well where be it sympathy the psychological strategist in taiwan stress the great sense of family cultivate in china over thousands of year it have not be extirpate by ten year of communist depersonalization every soldier in the army have somewhere relative who be close to starvation the soldier themselves can not stage a successful rebellion it be assume but will they discontent spread to the officer class the immediate family of the general and the admiral be well feed a despot do not economize on he general but there be the cousin and aunt and nephew they privation be almost beyond endurance in behalf of what leninism-marxism a understand by exegete mao to whom will the general stay loyal there be little doubt if they have a secret ballot they would vote for food for they family in place of ideological purity out on the farm it be another question whether they or a single general off in a corner of china secure for a few galvanize day at least from instant retaliation will defy the party but the disposition to rebel be most definitely there but there must be a catalytic pressure the military in taiwan believe that the communist have make two mistake which together may prove fatal the first be the commune program which will ensure agricultural poverty for year the family be largely break up and where it be not it be leave with no residue and the social mean of this be enormous for it be the family that in china have always provide social security for the indigent the sick the down-and-out member of the clan now the government must do that but the government be leave with no reserve granary under the agricultural system it have ordain thus the government simultaneously undertake the vast burden of social security which have traditionally be privately discharge and create a national scarcity which have engender calamitous problem of social security the second mistake be tibet tibet have historically serve china a a buffer state a friendly state sometimes only semi-independent but never hostile china never try to integrate tibet by extirpate the people s religion and institution red china be try to do this and she be not likely ever to succeed tibet be too vast the terrain be too difficult tibet may bleed china a algeria be bleed france these continue pressure social economic and military be do much to keep china in a heighten state of tension the imposition of yet another pressure a strong one from the outside might cause it to snap the planner in taiwan strike i a realistic man they know that they must depend heavily on factor outside they own control first and foremost they depend on the inhuman idiocy of the communist regime on these they feel they can rely secondly they depend on america s moral cooperation when the crucial moment arrive they hope that if history vouchsafe the west another budapest we will receive the opportunity gladly i remark jocularly to the president that the future of china would be far more certain if he would invite a planeload of select american liberal to quemoy on an odd day he affect most properly not to understand i point but he and all of china wear the scar of american indecisiveness and he know what an uncertain ally we be we have be grand to formosa itself lot of aid and most of the time a policy of support for the offshore island but we outlook have be and continue to be defensive a great deal depend on the crystallization of mr kennedy s view on the world struggle the free chinese know that the situation on the mainland be in flux and be poise to strike there be not anywhere on the frontier of freedom a more highly mobilize force for liberation the moment of truth be the moment of crisis during the slow buildup the essence of a policy or a man be conceal under embroider detail fine word strut gesture the crisis burn these suddenly away there the truth be open to eye that be will to look the moment pass new self-deceiving rag be hurriedly toss on the too-naked bone a truth-revealing crisis erupt in katanga for a couple of day this month to be quickly smother by the high pressure verbal fog that be keep on tap for such emergency before memory too cloud over let we make a note or two of what could be see the measure be instantly take a always in such case of public man at many level one know good now who have bone and who have jelly in he spine but i be here concern more with policy than with man public man come and go but great issue of policy remain now everyone know or know in the week of december 10 that something have go shockingly wrong with american foreign policy the unite state be engage in a military attack on a peaceful orderly people govern by a regime that have prove itself the most pro-western and anti-communist within any of the new nation the only place in africa moreover where a productive relationship between white and black have apparently be achieve of course the fight be officially under the auspices of the unite nation but in the moment of truth everyone could see that the we be in reality the principal the moment simultaneously reveal that in the crisis we policy run counter to that of all we nato ally to the entire western community by we policy the west be be split but the key revelation be not new the control pattern be first display in the hungary-suez crisis of november 1956 it reappear in whole or part whenever a new crisis expose the reality in cuba last spring with which the dominican event of last month should be pair at the peak of the nuclear test and the berlin cycle in relation to laos algeria south africa right now with almost cartoon emphasis in the temporally link complex of tshombe-gizenga-goa-ghana what the moment reveal this prime element of the truth may be state a follow under prevail policy the we can take the initiative against the right but can not take the initiative against the leave it make no difference what part of the world be involve what form of regime what particular issue the we can not take the initiative against the leave there be even some question whether the we can any long defend itself against an initiative by the leave we can attack tshombe but not gigenza no matter that gizenga be moscow s man in the congo no matter that it be he troop who rape western woman and eat western man no matter that the katanga operation be strategically insane in term of western interest in africa even grant that the congo should be unify you do nt protect western security by first remove the pro-western weight from the power equilibrium we can force britain and france out of the suez but we can not so much a try to force the russian tank back from budapest we can mass we fleet against the trujillos but not against the castros we can vote in the un against south african apartheid or portuguese rule in angola but we can not even introduce a motion on the berlin wall much less give the simple order to push the wall down we officially receive the anti-french moscow-allied algerian fln but we denounce the pro-europe anti-communist oas a criminal in the very week of we war against katanga we make a $ 133 million grant to kwame nkrumah who have just declare he solidarity with the communist bloc and be busily turn he own country into a totalitarian dictatorship a we plane land the war materiel that kill pro-western katangans we stand supinely bleat while nehru s troop smash into a five-hundred-year-old district of we nato ally portugal what explain this uni-directional paralysis it be the consequence of the system of idea that constitute the frame of we international and in some degree we domestic policy the suez-hungary crisis prove that this system be not invent by the new administration but only make more consistent and more active key to the puzzle most immediately relevant to these episode in goa katanga and ghana a to the suez-hungary crisis before they be the belief that the main theater of the world drama be the underdeveloped region of asia africa and latin america from this belief be derive the practical orientation of we policy on the uncommitted neutralist contest nation especially on those whose leader make the most noise nehru tito nkrumah sukarno betancourt etc we chief aim become that of find favor in neutralist eye if we grasp this orientation a a key we national conduct in all of the event here mention become intelligible and it become clear why in general we can not take the initiative against the leave
