much more than shelter house symbolize social status a sense of belong acceptance within a give group or neighborhood identification with particular cultural value and social institution feeling of pride and worth aspiration and hope basic to human well-being for almost one-sixth of the national population discrimination in the free selection of residence cast a considerable shadow upon these value assume a self-evident by most american few business group in recent year have come under heavy pressure to face these reality than real estate broker and home builder this pressure have urge re-evaluation of the assumption underlie they professional ethics it have seek new sympathy for the human aspiration of racial minority group in this country it be not surprise that a spokesman for real estate interest the national association of real estate board nareb and it local association have seek to limit and often ignore much of this pressure how do the local realtor see himself in the context of house restriction base on race religion or ethnic attachment what do he conceive he role to be in this area of social unrest what ought to be what be he potential role a a force for constructive social change what social ethical and theological insight can the church and university help he bring to bear upon he situation recently a group of the faculty at wesleyan university s public affair center seek some answer to these question several new england realtor be invite to participate in a small colloquium of property lawyer political scientist economist social psychologist social ethicists and theologian here in an atmosphere of forthrightness and mutual criticism each seek to bring he particular insight to bear upon the question of discrimination in house and the part each man present play in it for a number of year wesleyan have be draw vary group of political and business leader into these informal discussion with member of the faculty and student body attempt to explore and clarify aspect of they responsibility for public policy this article present we observation of that session of the realtor a they see themselves and a the faculty and student see they such conversation quickly reveal an ethically significant ambivalence in the self-image hold by most realtor within the membership of this group a have be find true of man in other professional or trade association the most ready portrayal of oneself to the public be that of a neutral agent simply serve the interest of a seller or buyer and mediate between they professional responsibility be see to consist largely in serve the wish of the client fairly and in an efficient manner but a conversation go on particularly among the realtor themselves another image emerge that of considerable power and influence in the community obviously much more than customer expectation be determine the realtor s role judgment be continually render regard the potential buyer income educational level and above all racial extraction and whether these would qualify they for congenial happy relation to other people in certain community area a narrow professionalism how explicit such factor have be historically be evident in any chronology of restrictive covenant case or in a review of nareb s code of ethics article 34 in the code adopt in 1924 state that a realtor should never be instrumental in introduce into a neighborhood a character of property or occupancy member of any race or nationality or any individual whose presence will clearly be detrimental to property value in that neighborhood though the reference to race be stricken by the association in 1950 be an agent of such detrimental influence still appear a the cardinal sin realtor see themselves commit to avoid the rationale for this avoidance be most frequently express in economic term all fear the suppose stigma they believe would inevitably attach to any realtor who openly introduce non-white particularly negro people into all-white restrict area they would become tag a man not interest in be purely real estate professional but agitator for some kind of cause or reform and this be no long to be a pro obviously what we be confront with here be the identification of professional with narrow skill and specialization the effective service of a client rather than responsiveness to the wide and deep mean and association of one s work these man for the most part educate in we good new england college well establish financially and socially in the community under kindly but insistent probe reveal little or no objective or explicit criterion or data for they generalization about the interest and attitude of the people they claim to serve or about the public response that actually follow they occasional breach of a client-service relationship this narrow professionalism do not even fit the present reality of they situation a the pressure of minority and the power and respectability of the realtor increase a we discussion continue the inadequacy of the client relationship a an interpretation of they way of operate become evident realtor live in they community a specialist in a give area of work a member of social and professional organization a citizen and civic leader a church layman a university alumni a newspaper reader etc from such communal role the realtor find the substance that shape he moral understand it seem to we that choice exercise by realtor in moral situation center in at least three area 1 the various way in which they interpret a particular social issue 2 they pattern of involvement in the regular legal and political process and most pervasively 3 they interpretation of who be a real pro of what it mean to be a professional man in a technical fragment society 1 most of the realtor minimize they own understand of and role in the racial issue plead that they only reflect the attitude and intention of they society there be some reality to this the commission on race and house conclude that there be no reason to believe that real estate man be either more or less racially prejudice on the whole than any other segment of the american population but such a reaction obscure the powerful effort make in the past by both nareb and it local board for the maintenance of restrictive clause and practice also it do not recognize the element of choice and judgment continually employ like business and university group generally these man have very limit knowledge of recent sociological and psychological study and finding that might illumine the decision they make realtor both generally and in this group have invariably equate residential integration with a decline in property value a circumstance view with considerable apprehension recent study by the commission on race and house and other however point to a vast complex of factor that often do not warrant this conclusion there be increase number of neighborhood that be integrate residentially without great loss of property value the white population have take the initiative in prepare the area for an appreciation of the negroes desire for well-kept house privacy etc data on the decline of property value in an area after a new racial group enter it have to be assess in term of the trend in property value before the group come in often they be able to get in only because the area be decline economically significantly no realtor and few of the faculty present be familiar with any of the six volume publish by the university of california press that present the commission s finding no one anticipate any radical shift in this situation but question concern read habit the availability of such data and the place where it be discuss must surely be raise the role of both church and university a source of information and setting within which the implication of such information may be explore need consideration relevant fact however extend beyond consideration of property value and maintenance of harmonious neighborhood discussion of minority house necessarily involve such basic issue a the intensity of one s democratic conviction and religious belief concern equality of opportunity the function and limitation of government in the secure of such equality and the spotlight that world opinion play upon local incident of racial agitation and strife against the grain of creation 2 realtor realize of course that they be involve in an increasingly complex legal and political system that be open up opportunity for leverage on they relation to client a well a opportunity for evasion of they responsibility for racial discrimination in house on the positive side recent federal action have largely undermine the legal sanction so long enjoy by the segregationist position anti-discriminatory statute in house have now be adopt by thirteen state and while specific provision have vary the tendency be clearly toward expand coverage realtor in attendance at the colloquium express interest for example in connecticut s new house law a set standard of equity that they would like to have to obey but in support of which none have be will to go on public record a far a they be aware the connecticut association of real estate board have not officially oppose the bill s passage or lobby in it support this have not be the case everywhere in 1957 the real estate board of new york city actively oppose the then pending private house anti-discrimination law official reason the bill be a wanton invasion of basic property right there be sin of omission a well a commission the attitude adopt by realtor and they association either negative or positive play a large part in the public acceptance of such measure and the degree to which they may be effectively enforce judicial opinion since the supreme court decision on shelley v kraemer 1948 have render racial restrictive covenant unenforcible such a decision should have place a powerful weapon in the hand of the entire house industry but there be little evidence that realtor or at least they association have repudiate the principle in such clause in the state that have pass law prevent discrimination in the sale or rental of house support by real estate association for compliance and broaden coverage through additional legislation could help remove the label of social reformism that most realtor individually seem determine to avoid but a yet no real estate board have be will officially to support such law or to admit the permissibility of introduce minority buyer into all-white neighborhood one of the role of the social scientist ethicist or theologian in we discussion with the realtor become that of encourage great awareness of the opportunity offer by the legal and political process for the exercise of broad social responsibility in they work but responsiveness to these opportunity presume that all of we judge the good a a human good and not simply a a professional white american good such judgment be meaningful only in so far a person be member of a world let we say a community that embrace scarsdale or yonkers but be also infinitely rich since it be all-inclusive that community of all creation be then the ultimate object of we loyalty and the concrete norm of all moral judgment racial discrimination be wrong then not because it go against the grain of a faculty member try to converse with a few realtor but because it go against the grain of creation and against the will of the creator thus moral issue concern the nature of the legal and political process take on theological dimension a fragment society 3 over the year individual engage in the sale of real estate have develop remarkable unity in the method and practice employ most realtor and real estate broker talk of themselves a professional people with the cultural and moral value hold by the traditional profession but what significance attach to professional beyond the narrow sense of skillfulness in meet a client s state need a already note we faculty and student press this issue more than any other a a theologian in the group point out a professional be before the modern period of technical specialization one who profess to be a bearer and critic of he culture in the use of he particular skill
