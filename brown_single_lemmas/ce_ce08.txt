scientist say that the world and everything in it be base on mathematics without math the man who be continually seek the cause of and the reason for the many thing that make the world go round would not have any mean of analyze standardize and communicate the thing they discover and learn math and the formula that allow it to be apply to different problem be therefore essential to any scientific endeavor hot rod be a science it s not a science a involve a determine what make the earth rotate on it axis or build a rocket or put a satellite into orbit but it be nevertheless a science but because science be base on mathematics do nt mean that a hot rodder must necessarily be a mathematician a guy can be an active and successful hot rodder for year without become even remotely involve with mathematical problem however he will have a clear understand of what he be do and the chance be he will be more successful if he understand the few formula that apply to rod a mathematical formula be nothing more than a pattern for solve a specific problem it place the various factor involve in the problem in they correct order in relation to each other so that the influence of factor on each other can be compute the first step in use a formula be to insert the numerical value of the factor involve in they correct position in the formula this change the formula to an equation the equation be use for the mathematical process of solve the problem equation for rod formula be not complicate they involve only simple mathematics that be teach in grammar school arithmetic class however it be essential that the various mathematical symbol use in the equation be understand so that the mathematical process can be do properly and in they correct order they indicate simple division multiplication subtraction and addition the symbol for division be a straight line that separate two number place one above the other the low number be always divide into the upper number afj the symbol for multiplication be \*\* b it be use to separate two or more number in a row for example afj number to be multiply together may be multiply in any order the result will be the same regardless of the order use the symbol for subtraction be the standard minus sign this be nothing more than a dash it separate two or more number the number on the right of the symbol be always subtract from the number on the leave of the symbol for example afj when more than two figure be separate by subtraction symbol the subtraction must be carry out from the leave to right if the result be to be correct for example for the problem afj 10 from 25 equal 15 then 6 from 15 equal 9 addition be indicate by the + symbol the symbol be use to separate two or more number for example afj number separate by addition symbol may be place in any order when solve an equation that involve division a well a other step do all the division step first to reduce those part of the equation to they numerical value multiplication subtraction and addition can then be accomplish a they appear in the equation by start at the leave end of the equation and work toward the right complete the division first also include those division part that require multiplication subtraction or addition step afj this would be reduce by multiply 8 time 6 and then divide the product by 12 this part of the equation would then become 4 for use in formula fraction should be convert to they decimal equivalent the easy way to do this be with a conversion chart chart for this purpose be available from many source they be include in all type of mathematical handbook and they be stamp on some type of precision measure instrument the various mathematical process can be simplify by carry the result to only two or three decimal place shorten the result in this manner will not have any detrimental effect on the accuracy of the final result some formula contain constant a constant be a number that remain the same regardless of the other number use in the formula and the resultant equation it be a number without which the equation can not be solve correctly rod formula apply to many phase of the sport the answer they give can often pave the way to performance increase and quite often be necessary for complete entry blank for different event when it be need one formula be a important a another however some formula be use more than other we ll take they in the general order of they popularity engine displacement a rodder should be able to compute the displacement of he engine displacement be sometimes refer to a sweep volume most entry blank for competitive event require engine displacement information because of class restriction it be good to be able to compute displacement so that change in it result from boring and stroke can be compute factor involve in the displacement formula be the bear diameter of the engine s cylinder the length of the piston stroke the number of cylinder in the engine and a constant the constant be which be one-quarter of 31416 another constant know a pi pi be use in formula concern with the dimension of circle actually the engine displacement formula be the standard formula for compute the volume of a cylinder of any type with an add factor that represent the number of cylinder in the engine the cross-sectional area of the cylinder be determine and then the volume of the individual cylinder be compute by multiply the area by the stroke length which be the equivalent of the length of the cylinder multiply the result by the number of cylinder in the engine give the engine s total displacement the formula be afj dimension in inch and fraction of inch will give the displacement in cubic inch dimension in centimeter and fraction of centimeter will give the displacement in cubic centimeter cc one inch equal 254 centimeter one cubic inch equal 1638 cubic centimeter for example let s consider a standard 283 cubic inch chevy afj these engine have a cylinder diameter of 3-78 inch and a stroke length of 3 inch the formula with the fraction convert to decimal become afj to arrive at the answer multiply the number together by start at the leave of the group and work to the right the different step will look like this afj compression ratio a cylinder s compression ratio be compute by compare the cylinder s volume or it displacement with the total volume of the cylinder and it combustion chamber cylinder volume can be determine mathematically but combustion chamber volume must be measure with a liquid cylinder volume be determine in exactly the same manner a for the displacement formula afj to measure the volume of one of the combustion chamber in the cylinder head install the valve and spark plug in the chamber and support the head so that it gasket surface be level then pour water or light oil from a graduate beaker into the chamber to fill the chamber to it gasket surface do not overfill the chamber this be possible with water and other liquid that have a high surface tension such liquid will rise to a considerable height above the surface around the chamber before they will flow out of the chamber the amount of liquid pour into the chamber be determine by subtract the quantity still in the beaker when the chamber be full from the original quantity most beaker be graduate in cubic centimeter cc make it necessary to convert the result to cubic inch however the displacement of the cylinder can be convert to cubic centimeter the compression ratio arrive at with the formula will be the same regardless of whether cubic inch or cubic centimeter be use the only precaution be that all volume use in the formula be quote in the same term the volume of the cylinder open in the head gasket must be compute by multiply it area in square inch by the gasket s thickness in thousandths of an inch sometimes it be necessary to roughly calculate the square inch area of the open but the calculation can usually be make with sufficient accuracy that it will nt affect the final computation the volume of the open be add to the combustion chamber volume another thing that must be take into consideration be the volume of the area between the top of the piston and the top of the cylinder block when the piston be in top dead center position compute this volume by measure the distance from the top of the block to the piston head a accurately a possible with a depth micrometer or some other precision measure device and then multiply the area of the cylinder by the depth the formula for this step be afj this volume be add to the total volume of the combustion chamber and head gasket open the total of these three volume be the final combustion chamber volume after the factor just describe have be compute they be apply to the follow formula afj for an example let s dream up an engine that have a final combustion chamber volume of 5 cubic inch and a cylinder volume of 45 cubic inch apply these figure to the formula we get the equation afj the compression ratio be 10 to 1 this method of compute compression ratio can not be use accurately for engine that have piston with either dome or irregularly shape head any irregularity on the piston head will make it impossible with normal mean to determine the final combustion chamber volume because the volume displace by the piston head can not be readily compute the only way to determine the final combustion chamber volume when such piston be use be by measure it with liquid while the cylinder head be bolt to the cylinder block and the piston be in top dead center position gear ratio speed relationship there be four version of the formula that involve the relationship of car speed engine speed rear axle gear ratio and rear tire size by use the appropriate version any one of these factor can be determine for any combination of the other three to simplify the formula a representative symbol be substitute for each of the factor these be mph for car speed for engine crankshaft speed for rear axle gear ratio for tire size tire size can be determine in several way but the one that be the easy and a accurate a any be by measure the effective radius of a wheel and tire assembly this be do by measure the distance from the surface on which the tire be rest to the center of the rear axle shaft a tire must be inflate to it normal hot operate pressure and the car must be load to it operate weight when this measurement be make the measurement must be in inch any fraction of an inch involve in the measurement must be convert to a decimal equivalent to simplify the mathematics when tire size be measure in this manner a constant of 168 be use in the formula to determine car speed for a give combination of engine speed gear ratio and tire size the formula be afj for an engine speed of 5000 rpm a gear ratio of 400 to 1 and a tire radius of 13 inch the equation would look like this afj to determine engine speed for a give combination of the other three factor the formula be afj use the same figure a for the previous example the equation become afj to determine the rear axle gear ratio for a combination of the other three factor the formula be afj use the figure from the previous example the equation become afj
