strategy and tactic of the we military force be now undergo one of the great transition in history the change of emphasis from conventional-type to missile-type warfare must be make with care mindful that the one type of warfare can not be safely neglect in favor of the other we military force must be capable of contend successfully with any contingency which may be force upon we from limit emergency to all-out nuclear general war force and military personnel strength this budget will provide in the fiscal year 1961 for the continue support of we force at approximately the present level a year-end strength of 2489000 man and woman in the active force the force to be support include an army of 14 division and 870000 man a navy of 817 active ship and 619000 man a marine corps of 3 division and 3 air wing with 175000 man and an air force of 91 combat wing and 825000 man if the reserve component be to serve effectively in time of war they basic organization and objective must conform to the change character and mission of the active force quality and combat readiness must take precedence over mere number under modern condition this be especially true of the ready reserve i have request the secretary of defense to reexamine the role and mission of the reserve component in relation to those of the active force and in the light of the change requirement of modern warfare last year the congress discontinue it previously impose minimum personnel strength limitation on the army reserve similar restriction on the strength of the army national guard contain in the 1960 department of defense appropriation act should likewise be drop i strongly recommend to the congress the avoidance of mandatory floor on the size of the reserve component so that we may have the flexibility to make adjustment in keep with military necessity i again propose a reduction in the army national guard and army reserve from they present strength of 400000 and 300000 respectively to 360000 and 270000 by the end of the fiscal year 1961 these strength be consider adequate to meet the essential role and mission of the reserve in support of we national security objective military personnel cost about 30 % of the expenditure for the department of defense in 1961 be for military personnel cost include pay for active reserve and retire military personnel these expenditure be estimate to be $ 121 billion an increase of $ 187 million over 1960 reflect additional longevity pay of career personnel more dependent an increase number of man draw proficiency pay and social security tax increase effective for the full year in 1961 compare with only 6 month in 1960 retire pay cost be increase by $ 94 million in 1961 over 1960 partly because of a substantial increase in the number of retire personnel these increase cost be partially offset by a decrease of $ 56 million in expenditure for the reserve force largely because of the plan reduction in strength of the army reserve component during 1961 traditionally rate of pay for retire military personnel have be proportionate to current rate of pay for active personnel the 1958 military pay act depart from this establish formula by provide for a 6 % increase rather than a proportionate increase for everyone retire prior to it effective date of june 1 1958 i endorse pending legislation that will restore the traditional relationship between retire and active duty pay rate operation and maintenance expenditure for operate and maintain the station and equipment of the arm force be estimate to be $ 103 billion in 1961 which be $ 184 million more than in 1960 the increase stem largely from the grow complexity of and high degree of maintenance require for new weapon and equipment a substantial increase be estimate in the cost of operate additional communication system in the air defense program a well a in all program where speed and security of communication be essential also the program for fleet modernization will be step up in 1961 cause an increase in expenditure far increase arise from the civilian employee health program enact by the congress last year other factor increase operate cost include the high unit cost of each fly hour up 11 % in two year and of each steam hour up 15 % in total these increase in operate cost outweigh the saving that result from decline program and from economy measure such a reduce number of unit and installation small inventory of major equipment and improvement in the supply and distribution system of the arm force in the budget message for 1959 and again for 1960 i recommend immediate repeal of section 601 of the act of september 28 1951 65 stat 365 this section prevent the military department and the office of civil and defense mobilization from carry out certain transaction involve real property unless they come into agreement with the committee on arm service of the senate and the house of representative a i have state previously the attorney general have advise i that this section violate fundamental constitutional principle accordingly if it be not repeal by the congress at it present session i shall have no alternative thereafter but to direct the secretary of defense to disregard the section unless a court of competent jurisdiction determine otherwise basic long-line communication in alaska be now provide through federal facility operate by the army air force and federal aviation agency the grow communication need of this new state can good be meet a they have in other state through the operation and development of such facility by private enterprise legislation have already be propose to authorize the sale of these government-owned system in alaska and it early enactment be desirable procurement research and construction approximately 45 % of the expenditure for the department of defense be for procurement research development and construction program in 1961 these expenditure be estimate at $ 189 billion compare to $ 193 billion in 1960 the decrease which be largely in construction and in aircraft procurement be offset in part by increase for research and development and for procurement of other military equipment such a tank vehicle gun and electronic device expenditure for shipbuilding be estimate at about the same level a in 1960 new obligational authority for 1961 recommend in this budget for aircraft procurement exclude amount for relate research and construction total $ 4753 million which be $ 1390 million below that enact for 1960 on the other hand the new authority of $ 3825 million propose for missile procurement exclude research and construction in 1961 be $ 581 million high than for 1960 these contrast trend in procurement reflect the anticipate change in the composition and mission of we arm force in the year ahead the department of defense appropriation act for the past several year have contain a rider which limit competitive bid by firm in other country on certain military supply item a i have repeatedly state this provision be much more restrictive than the general law popularly know a the buy american act i urge once again that the congress not reenact this rider the task of provide a reasonable level of military strength without endanger other vital aspect of we security be greatly complicate by the swift pace of scientific progress the last few year have witness what have be perhaps the most rapid advance in military technology in history some weapon system have become obsolescent while still in production and some while still under development furthermore unexpectedly rapid progress or a technological break-through on any one weapon system in itself often diminish the relative importance of other competitive system this have necessitate a continuous review and reevaluation of the defense program in order to redirect resource to the new and more important weapon system and to eliminate or reduce effort on weapon system which have be overtake by event thus in the last few year a number of program which look very promise at the time they development be commence have since be completely eliminate for example the importance of the regulus 2 a very promise aerodynamic ship-to-surface missile design to be launch by surface submarine be greatly diminish by the successful acceleration of the much more advance polaris ballistic missile launch by submerge submarine another example be the recent cancellation of the f-108 a long-range interceptor with a speed three time a great a the speed of sound which be design for use against man bomber in the period of the mid-1960 s the substantial progress be make in ballistic missile technology be rapidly shift the main threat from man bomber to missile consider the high cost of the f-108 system over $ 4 billion for the force that have be plan and the time period in which it would become operational it be decide to stop far work on the project meanwhile other air defense force be be make effective a describe late in this message the size and scope of other important program have be reduce from early plan notable in this category be the jupiter and thor intermediate range ballistic missile which have be successfully develop produce and deploy but the relative importance of which have diminish with the increase availability of the atlas intercontinental ballistic missile the impact of technological factor be also illustrate by the history of the high-energy fuel program this project be start at a time when there be a critical need for a high-energy fuel to provide an extra margin of range for high performance aircraft particularly we heavy bomber continue technical problem involve in the use of this fuel couple with significant improvement in aircraft range through other mean have now raise serious question about the value of the high-energy fuel program a a result the scope of this project have be sharply curtail these example underscore the importance of even more search evaluation of new major development program and even more penetrate and far-ranging analysis of the potentiality of future technology the cost of develop a major weapon system be now so enormous that the great care must be exercise in select new system for development in determine the most satisfactory rate of development and in decide the proper time at which either to place a system into production or to abandon it strategic force the deterrent power of we arm force come from both they nuclear retaliatory capability and they capability to conduct other essential operation in any form of war the first capability be represent by a combination of man bomber carrier-based aircraft and intercontinental and intermediate range missile the second capability be represent by we deploy ground naval and air force in essential forward area together with ready reserve capable of effect early emergency reinforcement the strategic air command be the principal element of we long-range nuclear capability one of the important and difficult decision which have to be make in this budget concern the role of the b-70 a long-range supersonic bomber this aircraft which be plan for initial operational use about 1965 would be complementary to but likewise competitive with the four strategic ballistic missile system all of which be schedule to become available early the first atlas icbm s be now operational the first two polaris submarine be expect to be operational this calendar year and the first titan icbm s next year the minuteman solid-fueled icbm be plan to be operational about mid-1963 by 1965 several or all of these system will have be fully test and they reliability establish thus the need for the b-70 a a strategic weapon system be doubtful however i be recommend that development work on the b-70 air-frame and engine be continue it be expect that in 1963 two prototype aircraft will be available for flight test by that time we should be in a much good position to determine the value of that aircraft a a weapon system i be recommend additional acquisition of the improve version of the b-52 the b-52h with the new turbofan engine and procurement of the b-58 supersonic medium bomber together with the support refueling tanker in each case these additional modern bomber will replace some of the old b-47 medium bomber one b-52 can do the work of several b-47 s which it will replace fund be also include in this budget to continue the equip of the b-52 wing with the hound dog air-to-surface missile in the come fiscal year additional quantity of atlas titan and polaris missile also will be procure
