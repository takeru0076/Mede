can thermonuclear war be set off by accident what step have be take to guard against the one sort of mishap that could trigger the destruction of continent be we a safe a we should be from such a disaster be anything be do to increase we margin of safety will the danger increase or decrease i have just ask these question in the pentagon in the white house in office of key scientist across the country and aboard the submarine that prowl for month underwater with neat row of green launch tube which contain polaris missile and which be affectionately know a sherwood forest i ask the same question inside the launch-control room of an atlas missile base in wyoming where officer who wear sidearm be man the commit button that could start a war accidentally or by design and in the command center where other pistol-packing man could give order to push such button to the man in the instrument-jammed bomber cockpit submarine compartment and the antiseptic windowless room that would be the foxhole of tomorrow s impersonal intercontinental war the question seem farfetched there be unceasing pressure but it source be immediate readiness exercise be almost continuous each could be the real thing in the command center there be special clock ready to tick off the minute elapse since e hour e stand for execution the moment a go order would unleash an american nuclear strike there be little time for the man in the command center to reflect about the implication of these clock they be preoccupy ride herd on control panel switch flash colore light on pale green or gray console that look like business machine they know little about they machinery beyond mechanical detail accidental war be so sensitive a subject that most of the people who could become directly involve in one be tell just enough so they can perform they portion of incredibly complex task among the policy maker general physicist psychologist and other charge with control the action of the button pusher and they hardware the answer to i question vary partly accord to a man s flair for what the professional in this field call scenario a an air force psychiatrist put it you can nt have dry run on this one the expert be thus force to hypothesize sequence of event that have never occur probably never will but possibly might only one rule prevail in i conversation with these man the more highly place they be that be the more they know the more concern they have become already accidental war be a silent guest at the discussion within the kennedy administration about the urgency of disarmament and nearly all other question of national security only recently new hole be discover in we safety measure and a search be now on for more work be under way to see whether new restrain device should be install on all nuclear weapon meanwhile the expert speak of war trigger by false pre-emption escalation unauthorized behavior and other term that will be discuss in this report they inhabit a secret world center on go code and gold phone they conversation be almost invariably accompany by the same gesture arm and point forefinger dart toward each other in arclike semicircular motion one arm represent we bomber and missile the other arm theirs yet implicit in each movement be the death of millions perhaps hundreds of millions perhaps you and i and the expert these man be not callous it be they job to think about the unthinkable unanimously they believe that the world would become a safe place if more of we and more russian and communist chinese too think about accidental war the first systematic think about this pandora s box within pandora s box be do four year ago by fred ikle a frail meek-mannered swiss-born sociologist he be and be with the rand corporation a nonprofit pool of thinker finance by the we air force he investigation make he the paul revere of accidental war and safety procedure be enormously increase in recent week a a result of a sweep defense policy reappraisal by the kennedy administration basic unite state strategy have be modify and large new sum allocate to meet the accidental-war danger and to reduce it a quickly a possible the chain start at bmews ballistic missile early warn system in thule greenland it radar screen would register soviet missile shortly after they be launch against the unite state bmews intelligence be simultaneously flash to norad north american air defense command in colorado spring colorado for interpretation to the sac command and control post forty-five foot below the ground at offutt air force base near omaha nebraska to the joint war room of the joint chief of staff in the pentagon and to the president telephone teletype several kind of radio system and in some case television link all vital point alternate location exist for all key command center for last-ditch emergency sac have alternate command post on kc-135 jet tanker multiple circuit routing and frequency make the chain a unbreakable a possible the same principle of redundancy apply to all communication on these special network and no message can be transmit on these circuit until sender and receiver authenticate in advance by special code that the message actually come from they purport source additional code can be use to challenge and counterchallenge the authentications only the president be permit to authorize the use of nuclear weapon that s the law but what if somebody decide to break it the president can not personally remove the safety device from every nuclear trigger he make the momentous decision hundreds of man be require to pass the word to the button pusher and to push the button what if one or more of they turn irrational or suddenly coolly decide to clobber the russian what if the president himself in the language of the military go ape or singlehandedly decide to reverse national policy and hit the soviet without provocation nobody can be absolutely certain of the answer however the system be design ingeniously and hopefully so that no one man could initiate a thermonuclear war even the president can not pick up he telephone and give a go order even he do not know the one signal for a nuclear strike the go code in an emergency he would receive available intelligence on the gold-phone circuit a system of gold actually yellow phone connect he with the office and action station of the secretary of defense the joint chief of staff the sac commander and other key man all can be connect with the gold circuit from they home all could help the president make he decision the talk would not be in code but neither would it ramble vital question would be quickly answer accord to a preprepared agenda officer who participate in the continual practice drill assure i that the president s decision could be make and announce on the gold circuit within minute after the first flash from afj if communication work he decision would be instantly know in all command post that would originate the actual go order for these center too be on the gold circuit they include the navy s atlantic command at norfolk virginia which be in contact with the polaris sub nato headquarters in europe air force forward headquarters in europe and in the pacific which control tactical fighter on ship and land base and sac which control long-range bomber and atlas missile let we look in on one of these nerve center sac at omaha and see what must still happen before a wing of b-52 bomber could drop they afj in a word plenty the key man almost certainly would be col william w wisman sac s senior controller he or he deputy or one of they seven assistant all full colonel man the heart of the command post twenty-four hour a day it be a quiet but impressive room 140 foot long thirty-nine foot wide twenty-one foot high movable panel of floor-to-ceiling map and chart be cram with intelligence information and bill wisman forty-three a farmer s son from beallsville ohio be a quiet but impressive man he eye be steady anchor of the deep word he movement and speech be precise clear and quick no question ruffle he or cause he to hesitate wisman who have have the chief controller s job for four year call the signal for a team operate three row of dull-gray console stud with light switch and button at least a dozen man some arm be never far away from he in front of he be a gold phone in emergency the sac commander gen thoma power or he deputy and they staff would occupy a balcony that stretch across the length of the room above wisman and he staff at general power s seat in the balcony there be also a gold phone general power would participate in the decision make wisman below would listen in and act he console can give he instant contact with more than seventy base around the world and with every sac aircraft he need only pick up one of the two red telephone receiver at he extreme leave right next to the big red button mark alert there be two receiver in case one should be drop and damage but wisman too do not know the go code he must take it from the red box in point of fact this be a beige box with a bright red door about one and a half foot square and hang from the wall about six foot from the door to wisman s right the box be internally wire so the door can never be open without set off a screech klaxon it s real obnoxious now we must become vague for we be approach one of the nation s most guard secret the code in the red box there be several of they cover various contingency be contain in a seal x-ray-proof unique device they be supply a batch at a time by a secret source and be continually change by wisman or he staff at random interval but even the content of wisman s box can not start a war they be mere fragment just one portion of preprepared message what these fragment be and how they activate the go order may not be reveal the piece must be place in the context of the prepare message by wisman s staff in addition to the authentication and acknowledgment procedure which precede and follow the send of the go message again in special code each message also contain an internal authenticator another specific signal to convince the recipient that he be get the real thing i ask wisman what would happen if he break out the go code and try to start transmit one i d wind up full of bullet hole he say and there be no question that he be talk about bullet fire by he coworker now let we imagine a wing of b-52 s on alert near they positive control or fail-safe point the spot on the map many mile from soviet territory beyond which they be forbid to fly without specific order to proceed to they target they too have fragment of the go code with they a wisman put it they have separate piece of the pie and we have the whole pie once we send out the whole pie they can put they piece into it unless we send out the whole pie they piece mean nothing why do wisman s ever-changing code always mesh with the fragment in possession of the button pusher the answer be a cryptographic secret at any rate three man out of a six-man b-52 crew be require to copy down wisman s go-to-war message each must match wisman s pie with the fragment that he carry with he all three must compare note and agree to go after that it require several minute of concentrate work include six separate and deliberate action by a minimum of three man sit at three separate station in a bomber each with another man beside he to help for an arm bomb to be release unless all gadget be properly operate and the wire and seal from the handle remove first no damage can be do
