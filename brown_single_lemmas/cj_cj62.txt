those whom i wish to address with this letter be for the most part unknown to i it may well be that when rudy pozzatti and i visit you country last spring you be live and work close to the place we see and the street we walk a american artist it be natural that we would want to meet a many soviet artist a possible this letter might not have be necessary have we effort to meet and talk with you be more successful even though we do not see many of you face it appear now quite evident that a considerable number of you profession hear from those whom we have the fortune to encounter that we have be in you midst i be very please that quite a number of you find way to communicate to i you desire to hear of we reaction and experience in the ussr i can well understand you curiosity we ourselves be always eager to know how other feel about we and the way in which we live it be i hope that this write message and report will reach you through the good office of the union of soviet artist there should be no reason to misinterpret or ignore the intent of this letter pozzatti and i endeavored earnestly to record we impression without the prejudice that the anxiety of we time so easily provoke the time-span of little more than a month can not entitle i to pose a an expert on anything i see too much damage be do by expert who have spend even less time if any at all in the ussr nevertheless i consider it reasonable because of i commitment a an artist to assume that the right and responsibility of creative individual be relate to humanity a a whole rather than to specific geo-political interest if this attitude be seriously question in the soviet union it do not necessarily follow that the majority of the society in which i live be too aware of the necessity for clarity on this ethical a well a aesthetic point of view it be a matter of some disappointment to i that still many of i own countryman be too shortsighted to ascribe any symbolic significance to the plight of a minority such a artist in any social order i encounter many question and great interest upon i return from the soviet union about i reaction to that experience that which i find most profound and most disturb appear to evoke a curiously mute reaction almost a if i be talk about something quite unreal apparently this be not the time and the climate in which people will listen objectively or at least dispassionately to individual impression of a subject which preoccupy a good deal of they wake moment personal predisposition tend to blunt the ear and in turn the voice a well i can not be content with the anecdotal small talk of a somewhat unusual travelogue i be equally impatient with the shrug of the shoulder shake of the head of those who no long care because they have know it for so long the aggressive disbelief of those who be romantically lose in a semantic jungle of the word revolution the belligerent denunciation by the sick fanatic of ignorance who try to build a papier-mache wall of pseudo-patriotism on we physical horizon difficult a it may have be at time pozzatti and i see enough talk to enough artist historian and other to realize that the issue be quite clear artist and poet be the raw nerve-end of humanity they be small in number and they contribution be not immediately decisive in everyday life by themselves they may not be able to save the life on this planet but without they there would be very little leave worth save it can not be say that we very first day in the soviet union turn out to be an ordinary one on that cold but bright april day we be guest of you government in the review stand of red square to witness the poeple s celebration for yuri gagarin and late on that day we attend the somewhat more exclusive reception for he in one of the impressive palace of the kremlin if we thus spend we very first day in the midst of a large number of you people honoring a new hero and a great national achievement we last day to we at least be equally impressive and very move even though the crowd be absent and there be almost complete silence we stand under a gigantic tree in the roll country just outside of moscow look at silent flower on the grave of a russian poet and writer who cherish the love for he country to the point of forego the high international honor the grave about half-way between he home and the blue turret of a small church rise above the form and space of gently undisciplined pasture of green the sound of bird the silence of other grave and the casual path through small forest just yesterday we have meet and talk with a live writer a contemporary of the dead poet who be know for he ability of manipulate he idea and he craft more advantageously but today we be aware of only two man one have take a flight into uncharted space in the service of science to return a a live hero the other have assume the right to explore the equally uncharted space of the human spirit the flower on he grave attest to the fact that he a well be somebody s hero these two recollection form the frame around a series of experience and sight which to i at least symbolize the extreme in the aesthetic a well a ethical conflict between materialism and humanism a struggle that be be wage all over the world in the half-light of disinterest the prevalent opinion which we encounter in a variety of expression in you country deny not only the existence of this conflict but it be elaborate even far with an incredible semantic dexterity the socialist environment it be state have cross-fertilized these two extreme seed and be about to produce a new plant and fruit when i speculate on one such occasion that the new growth like other mutation might be unable to propagate i be immediately accuse of preach racial prejudice i could not bring myself to answer that some of i good friend be non-propagating mule this kind of reason and logic take a little time to get use to after a while we be perhaps less surprise but still puzzle when a friendly discussion would suddenly jump the track into the most irrelevant and illogical comparison a chance remark about lenin s seal train bring the rejoinder that this be a myth akin to george washington s cherry tree theory of the behavior pattern of population mass be compare to scientific discovery concern the motion-pattern of gaseous mass no wonder that pozzatti and i have at time difficulty in remember the real purpose of we presence namely cultural exchange typical of such an experience be the occasion of a somewhat formal official welcome in the office of the union of soviet artist we have look forward to what we hope to be we first informal meet with a number of moscow s artist instead we become involve in a series of friendly but overly formal welcome address to which we have no choice but to reply in kind the term of friendship understand cooperation etc tend to become somewhat shopworn because of constant and indiscriminate use i can only hope that the continue exchange of group and individual between we country will not wear out all language pertinent to the occasion the preside female functionary of massive proportion and forbid appearance initially do not contribute to the expression of friendship and welcome by a number of dignified gentleman represent the art it be only after we have respond with what i fear be similar cliche that she go into action by question we desire for friendship and understand with a challenge about aggressive and warlike action by the we government in cuba and laos she retreat by leave the room when we suggest that we meet might well terminate right then and there unfortunately she return late just a i have take advantage of the friendly atmosphere in the room by state that perhaps an unexpect result of the cultural exchange program would be the re-emergence of abstract art in russia with social realism regain dominance in the we this give she an opportunity to ring down the curtain with the petulant admonition that we should not presume to lecture she on abstraction she do not go so far a to say a be do on other occasion that abstraction a well a impressionism be a russian invention that have be discard a unwanted by the people of the ussr pozzatti and i could not know then that we would experience this sort of treatment more often in moscow than elsewhere we be to discover in fact that quite a number of people share with we the impression that in contrast to other soviet region moscow s atmosphere be depressingly subdue and official to have one s intention deliberately or unintentionally misunderstand be always a waste of time until we moscow experience i have not consider it necessary to prepare any argument formally or informally artist simply do not talk to each other in that fashion and furthermore i could not presume the implication that i speak for american artist a a group to save time some clarification seem necessary the follow be a statement read to a large and friendly group of you fellow artist in leningrad we have come to you land with the express intention of understand and respect you idea and you way we presence here should also be consider far sincere evidence of the attempt by we people and they choose government to seek any and all possible way to effect close peaceful tie among all people we be quite convince that one of the main hope for the future depend upon the informal contact and exchange of idea between individual in spite of the relatively short period of time that we have experience among you we have already see many indication of you character and spirit we be acutely aware that yours be a society which in spite of several war and many privation have develop itself into one of the foremost nation of the world you past history be resplendent with the fruit of the intellect you present history be equally admirable for it industrial and scientific achievement we have come to you to experience something of you way of life while also attempt to acquaint you with that of ours while we a american artist believe deeply in the universal character of all intellectual activity we would be less than honest with you or ourselves if we fail to state a specific attitude toward we own society a well a the international community a a whole in state this position we should like to make it clear to you that we can not expect artist and intellectual in other land to share we opinion in every respect a a matter of fact we prize the diversity among we own people so much that we will not presume to speak for all other american artist but certainly all will agree that it be not so much the knowledge and search for similarity between you and we but rather the thoughtful exploration and acceptance of we difference which may lead we to we respective and desire goal with a minimum of misunderstanding like yourselves we have pride and love for we country to many of we this be a land to which we or we parent flee from totalitarian terror in order to live in dignified freedom a artist we feel the same obligation a do other individual in consider ourselves responsible citizen of a great nation
