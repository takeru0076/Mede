he shall we dare say he waterloo to go to the door mr herford touch the fat man s arm pardon i sir may i say that you have just demonstrate the truth of an old proverb the young pliny s if memory serve i which translate freely from the archaic latin say the more haste the less pee governor alfred e smith be the official host at the child s party unite state senator royal s copeland be wear the robe of santa claus and a great white beard the honorable robert wagner sr at that time a justice of the new york supreme court be on the reception committee i be in charge of the arrangement which be soon enough disarrange i have have difficulty from the very first day when in i enthusiasm i propose the party i city editor who dislike the club and many of it member try to block i participation in the gala event even early than that he have resent the fact that i have be choose to edit the club s reporter city editor victor watson of the new york american be a man of brood suspicion and mysterious shift of mood mr hearst s telegraphic code word for victor watson be fatboy the staff see in he the quality of a don cossack hence a mention before he nickname the hetman the hetman s physical aspect be not those of a savage rider of the steppe indeed he look more like a well-fleshed lie brother of the hospice of st bernard nor be he manner barbaric he have a pur voice and poker player s immobility of feature which somehow convey the feel that he know where all the body be bury he be the son of a scottish father and an american jewish mother long widow with whom he live in a comfortable home in flush he have work in the newspaper business since he be nineteen year old always for the hearst service from the very first he regard himself a mr hearst s disciple defender and afterward he prime minister self-ordained it be say that the hetman plot to take over the entire hearst newspaper empire one day by mean of various coup the destruction of editor who try to halt he course the unfrocking of publisher whose mistake of judgment might be magnify in secret report to mr hearst whatever the hetman s ambition he colleague be keep ill at ease among the outstanding member of the hearst cabinet whom he successfully oppose for a time be the great arthur brisbane bradford merrill ss carvalho and colonel van hamm he also dislike runyon for no good reason other than the fact that the demon s talent be so mark a to put he well beyond the hetman s say-so or he supervision runyon for he part have a contemptuous regard for mr watson he s a wrong-o say runyon and i would nt trust he a far a i could throw the statue of liberty arthur bug baer write to i just recently vic want to die in harness with he head towards the wagon he support he mother and he brother who afterwards commit suicide watson tell i that he brother always send rose to he mother blossom buy with vic s allowance to he and would you believe it vic add she like he good than she do i why about the only time the hetman seem excite be when one of he own pet idea be bear then he would get to he foot a though rise in honor of he own remarkable power and say almost invariably gentleman this be an amaze story it s big than the armistice some of the hetman s idea be dream-ridden vaguely impart and at time preposterous one day he assign i to lie bare a plot by the duponts to supply munition to a wholly fictitious revolution he say be about to occur in cuba he say that he information be so secret that he would not be able to confide in i the origin of he pipeline tip i can tell you this much he say it s big than the armistice i work for a day on this plainly ridiculous assignment and consult several of i own well-informed source then i spend the next two day at the baseball park and at jack doyle s pool parlor when i return to make i report the hetman do not remember have send i on the secret mission he be busy he say in have someone submit to a monkey-gland operation and i be to go to work on that odd matter i shall tell of it late on the hetman have a strong like for a story any story which be to be have by mean of much sleuthing or by roundabout method most of i story be obtain by simply seek out the person who could give i the fact and not a a rule by play clever trick one day i tire of follow the hetman s advice of shadow and of the ring-around-the-rosie approach to a report that enrico caruso have pinch a lady s hip while visit the central park monkey house i explain i state of mind to artist winsor mccay and to bug baer mr baer obtain a supply of crepe hair and spirit-gum from an actor at the friar we fashion beard put they on and report to the hetman at the city desk mr baer have an auburn beard like longfellow s mr mccay have on a sort of emperor maximilian beard and mustache a for myself i have on an enormous black muff this together with a derby hat and horn-rim eyeglass give i the appearance of a russian nihilist we be ready for you next mysterious assignment say mr baer to the hetman where to sir mr watson do not have much humor in he make-up but he manage a mirthless smile just then a reporter telephone in from the bronx to give the rewrite desk an account of a murder the hetman tell i to take the story over the phone and to write it while i be sit at one of the rewrite telephone with i derby and i great beard arthur brisbane whizz in with some editorial copy in he hand he pause for a moment to look at i then go on to the city desk to deliver he today column i think it expedient to take off i derby i glass and the beard and also to change telephone i manage to do this by the time the great ab return to the place where he last have see the fierce nihilist he stand there stare with disbelief at the vacant desk then he wrinkle he huge brow and go slowly out of the room he have a somewhat goggle-eyed expression he have be see thing the hetman s idea for news story or editorial campaign be by no mean always fruitless or lack in merit he campaign successfully for the riddance of death avenue and also bring about the end of pollution of metropolitan beach by sewage he expose the bucket-shop racket with the able assistance of two excellent reporter nat ferber and carl helm in the conduct of these and many other campaign the hetman prove to be a much abl journalist than he critic allow it seem to i now in a long backward glance that many of the hetman s conceit and odd action together with he grim posture when brandish the hatchet in the name of mr hearst be key with the tragedy which be to close over he one day alone reject on every hand divorce and in financial trouble he leap from an eleventh-floor window of the abbey hotel in 1937 one find it difficult to pass censure on the lonely figure who wait for day for a save word from he zealously serve idol wr hearst that word be withhold when the need of it seem the measure of he despair the unfinished note write in pencil upon the back of a use envelope and address to the coroner make one wonder about many thing god forgive i for everything i can not much to damon runyon s amazement a well a i own i get along splendidly with the hetman that be until i become an editor hence in he eye a rival not long after colonel van hamm have foist i on the watson staff i receive a salary raise and a contract on the hetman s recommendation during the next year he give i the second of the five contract i would sign with the hearst service it be a somewhat unusual thing for a reporter to have a contract in those day before the epidemic of syndicate columnist i would like to believe that i ability warrant this advancement somehow i think that watson pay more attention to i than he otherwise might have because he foe colonel van hamm would nt touch i with a ten-foot blue pencil i remember one day when mr hearst and i never know why he like i either send the hetman a telegram please find some more reporter like that young man from denver watson show this wire to colonel van hamm the colonel grunt then make a remark which might be construe in either of two way do nt bother to look any far we already have the only one of it kind the hetman do have friend but they be mostly outside the newspaper profession sergeant mike donaldson congressional medal of honor soldier be one of they dr mena s gregory be another i use to go with watson to call on the eminent neurologist at he apartment to sit among the doctor s excellent collection of statue painting and book and drink oriental coffee while watson seem to thaw out and become almost affable there be one time however when he face cloud and he suddenly blurt why do i brother commit suicide i can not remember dr gregory s reply if indeed he make one
