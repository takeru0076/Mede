ryan heft he bulk up and support it on one elbow he rub he eye sleepily with one huge paw ekstrohm nogol you guy okay nothing wrong with i that could nt be cure nogol say he do nt say what would cure he he have be explain all during the trip what he need to make he feel like himself he small black eye dart inside the olive oval of he face ekstrohm ryan insist okay well let s take a ground-level look at the country around here the facsiport roll open on the landscape a range of bluff hug the horizon the color of decay moss above they the sky be the black of space or the almost equal black of the winter sky above minneapolis see against neon-lit snow that cold empty sky be full of fire and light it seem almost a magnification of the galaxy itself of the milky way blow up by some master photographer this fiery swath be actually only a belt of minor planet almost like the asteroid belt in the original solar system these planet be much big nearly all capable of hold an atmosphere but to the infuriation of scientist for no know reason not all of they do this would be the fifth map expedition to the planetoid of yancy-6 in three generation they lie month away from the near earth star by jump drive and no one know what they be good for although it be feel that they would probably be good for something if it could only be discover much like the continent of antarctica in ancient history how can a planet with so many neighbor be so lonely ryan ask he be the captain so he could ask question like that some can be lonely in a crowd nogol say elaborately what will we need outside ryan ekstrohm ask no helmet the captain answer we can breathe out there all right it just will nt be easy this old world lose all of it helium and trace gas long ago nitrogen and oxygen be about it ryan look over there nogol say animal ring the ship think they re intelligent maybe hostile i think they re dead ekstrohm interject quietly i get no reading from they at all sonic electronic galvanic all blank accord to these needle they re stone dead ekstrohm you and i will have a look ryan say you hold down the fort nogol take it easy easy nogol confirm i hear a story once about a rookie who get excite when the captain step outside and he could nt get an encephalographic read on he i i know the mind of an officer work in a strange and unfathomable manner i m not worry about you mis-reading the dial nogol just about a lug like you read they at all remember when the little hand be straight up that s negative positive result start when it go towards the hand you use to make you mark but i m ambidextrous ryan tell he what he could do then ekstrohm smile and follow the captain through the airlock with only a glance at the lapel gauge on he coverall the strong negative field he suit set up would help to repel bacterium and insect actually the type of infection that could attack a warm-blooded mammal be not infinite and over the course of the last few hundred year adequate defense have be find for all basic category he be nt likely to come down with hot chill and puzzle stripe fever they ignore the ladder down to the planet surface and with only a glance at the seismological gauge to judge surface resistance drop to the ground it be day but in the thin atmosphere contrast be sharp between light and shadow they walk from midnight to noon noon to midnight and come to the beast sprawl on it side ekstrohm nudge it with a boot hey this be pretty close to a wart-hog uh-huh ryan admit one of the good match i ve ever find well it have to happen statistical average and all still it sometimes give you a creepy feel to find a rabbit or a snap turtle on some strange world it make you wonder if this exploration business be nt all some big joke and somebody have be everywhere before you even start the surveyor look sidewise at the captain the big man seldom give out with such thought ekstrohm clear he throat what shall we do with this one dissect it ryan nudge it with he toe follow ekstrohm s example i do nt know stormy it sure a hell do nt look like any dominant intelligent species to i no hand for one thing of course that s not definite proof no it be nt ekstrohm say i think we d good let it lie until we get a clear picture of the ecological setup around here in the meantime we might be think on the problem all these dead beast represent what kill they it look like we do when we make blastdown but what about we land be lethal to the creature radiation ekstrohm suggest the planet be very low in radiation from mineral deposit and the atmosphere seem to shield out most of the solar output any little dose of radiation might knock off these critter i do nt know about that maybe it would work the other way maybe because they have have virtually no radioactive exposure and do nt have any r s store up they could take a lot without harm then maybe it be the shockwave we set up or maybe it s sheer xenophobia they curl up and die at the sight of something strange and alien like a spaceship maybe the captain admit at this stage of the game anything could be possible but there s one possibility i particularly do nt like and that be suppose it be not we that kill these alien suppose it be something right on the planet native to it i just hope it do nt work on earthmen too these critter go real sudden ekstrohm lie in he bunk and think the camp be quiet the earthmen make camp outside the spaceship there be no reason to leave the comfortable quarter inside the ship except that face with a possibility of sleep on solid ground they simply have to get out the camp be a cluster of aluminum bubble ringe with a spy web to alert the earthmen to the approach of any be each man have a bubble to himself privacy after the long period of enforce intimacy on board the ship ekstrohm lie in he bunk and listen to the sound of the night on yancey-6 138 there be a keen of wind and a crack of the freeze ground insect there be on the world but they be freeze solid during the night only to revive and thaw in the morning sun the bunk he lie on be much more uncomfortable than the acceleration couch on board yet he know the other be sleep more soundly now that they have renew they contact with the matter that have birth they to send they ride high vacuum ekstrohm be not asleep now there could be an end to pretend he throw off the light blanket and swing he foot off the bunk to the floor ekstrohm stand up there be no long any need to hide but what be there to do what have change for he he no long have to lie in he bunk all night he eye close pretend to sleep in privacy he could walk around leave the light on read it be small comfort for insomnia ekstrohm never sleep some doctor have inform he he be mistake about this actually they say he do sleep but so shortly and fitfully that he forget other admit he be absolutely correct he never sleep he body process only slow down enough for he to dispell fatigue poison occasionally he fall into a wake gritty-eyed stupor but he never sleep never at all naturally he could nt let he shipmate know this insomnia would ground he from the exploration service on physiological if not psychological ground he have to hide it over the year he have have buddy in space in whom he think he could confide the buddy invariably take advantage of he since he could nt sleep anyway he might a well stand they watch for they or write they report where the hell do he get off threaten to report any laxness on they part to the captain a man with insomnia have good avoid bad dream of that kind if he know what be good for he ekstrohm have to hide he secret in a camp instead of shipboard hide the secret be easy but the secret itself be just a hard ekstrohm pick up a lightweight no-back from the ship s library a book by bloch the famous twentieth century expert on sex he scan a few line on the social repercussion of a celebrate nineteenth century sex murderer but he could nt seem to concentrate on the weighty pontifical ponderous style on impulse he flip up the heat control on he coverall and slide back the hatch of the bubble ekstrohm walk through the alien glass and look up at the unfamiliar constellation smell the freeze sterility of the thin air behind he he mate stir without wake ekstrohm be startle in the morning by a bang on the hatch of he bubble it take he a few second to put he thought in order and then he get up from the bunk where he have be rest sleeplessly the angry burnt-red face of ryan greet he okay stormy this be nt the place for fun and game what do you do with they do with what the dead beasties all the dead animal lay around the ship what be you talk about ryan what do you think i do with they i do nt know all i know be that they be go go ekstrohm shoulder he way outside and scan the veldt there be no ring of animal corpse nothing nothing but wispy grass whip in the keen breeze i ll be damn ekstrohm say you be right now buddy expe do nt like anybody muck up primary evidence where do you get off ryan ekstrohm demand why pick i for you patsy this have get to be some kind of local phenomenon why accuse a shipmate of be behind this listen ekstrohm i want to give you the benefit of every doubt but you be nt exactly the model of a surveyor you know you ve be ride on a pink ticket for six year you know that no ekstrohm say no i do nt know that you ve be hide thing from i and nogol every jump we ve make with you now come this it fit the pattern of secrecy and stealth you ve be involve in what could i do with you lousy dead body what would i want with they all i know be that you be outside the bubble last night and you be the only sentient be who come in or out of we alarm web the tape show that now all the body be miss like they get up and walk away it be not a new experience to ekstrohm no suspicion be nt new to he at all ryan there be other explanation for the disappearance of the body look for they will you i give you i word i m not try to pull some stupid kind of joke or to deliberately foul up the expedition take i word can nt you ryan shake he head i do nt think i can there s still such a thing a mental illness you may not be responsible ekstrohm scowl do nt try anything violent stormy i outweigh you fifty pound and i m fast for a big man i be nt plan on jump you why do you have to jump i the first time something go wrong
