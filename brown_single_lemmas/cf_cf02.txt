terrify italian crew who leave they light to shine for nine minute like an unerring home beacon until british mp s shoot it out in that interval the german bomber make a hell of bari harbor merchant ship illuminate in the light of the flare make to seem like stone imbed in a lake of polish mud be impossible to miss the little unsinkable sink almost immediately captain musmanno roar at he man to lash three of the cask of olive oil together for a raft they get it over the side and clamber aboard only a few minute before they schooner go under john bascom go down early too ensign vesole and he gunner have fight valiantly but they have no target most of the junker be above the blind light of the flare and the radar-controlled shore gun have be knock out by one of the first stick of bomb
