the average reader of this magazine own more than one gun we run a survey to find out but he s always on the lookout for new and good arm he s more than a reader of outdoor article he s a real hunter and shooter eager to improve he sport well if you re that kind of sportsman we re here to help you you ve probably give a lot of christmas-season think to the gun in you rack but it s not easy to decide on a new one you still have time to drop a few hint about the gift you d appreciate most the time to decide on they be now a a christmas service i ve take a close look at this year s crop of new model here they be with i comment and judgment read on take you pick and start drop those hint first on i own list would be two arm a rifle and a handgun that qualify a new in the strict sense for i a change barrel length or an improve stock do nt constitute a truly new design such modification be all for the good but it take something a different a a deerstalker or a jet to change arms-making concept bill ruger s long-awaited deerstalker under $ 110 be a new rifle action in a caliber that upset all the modern theory of high-velocity fan it s a short light quick-handling fast-firing little timber gun design to push a heavy slug at modest velocity but with lot of kill power and ample range for we most popular big game whitetail ruger report that on he recent african safari the little magnum cartridge be a real work horse small antelope be generally grass with one shoot and the magnum carbine also bag reedbuck kob and wart hog with deadly efficiency these be fairly large tough animal the deadliness of the magnum in a rifle come a no surprise to i at least five year ago tom robinson of marlin make up an over double rifle for i in this caliber use the now defunct model 90 action in 20-gauge size after figure out how to regulate the barrel so that they shoot to the same point of impact we fire this little 20-inch-barrel job on i home range and in marlin s underground test gallery we quickly run into the same trouble that plague bill ruger in he first experiment three or four bullet would be place well in a six-inch bull at 100 yard and then unaccountably one could stray far out of the group ruger learn that this be because the high velocity achieve in a long barrel be upset the shape of the unjacketed revolver bullet the new jackete slug in magnum correct this but even without jackete bullet i have enough faith in i double to take it on an opening-day deer hunt that first year within half an hour i jump a six-point buck that hop-skipped through a rhododendron thicket and i catch he just behind the leave foreleg at 60 yard he move only about 30 foot after the 240-grain slug hit he and this be after the bullet have pass through a sapling three more deer have fall to this same gun and all be one-shot kill i double be make with standard-weight revolver barrel before cut to revolver length and although it compare well in other respect it s considerably heavy than the deerstalker which only scale about 6-12 pound if ever a rifle meet the need of the whitetail hunter this be it the deerstalker point with the ease speed and precision of a fine import double shotgun and it trigger pull be light and sharp the 240-grain bullet leave the muzzle at 1850 fps which give it all the smash need at wood range with five shot at the immediate command of the hunter s trigger finger the gun and load be a deadly combination the second really new development this year be a revolver handle a different sort of varmint load the remington jet magnum center fire at present it s available in one model the fine and familiar smith & wesson magnum revolver about $ 110 long a top-quality handgun among target arm the velocity of this 40-grain bullet be rate at a very hot 2460 fps and it s the flat shoot of any revolver cartridge with a mid-range rise of about an inch over a 100-yard range this be a varmint load pure and simple it s much too explosive for small edible game it can cut a red squirrel neatly in two or burst a crow into a flurry of feather the most intriguing aspect of the s & w magnum chambered for the new jet be that it can also fire standard rim-fires by mean of adapter sleeve in the chamber you may therefore convert the gun into a small-game and plinking arm although the difference in the point of impact jet vs rim-fire can be somewhat disconcert the accuracy of the jet cartridge be fine i test it in i scope s & w and it be good enough to allow i to hit a chuck with every shoot at 100 yard if i do i part by hold the handgun steadily hunt rifle 61 the fact that the deerstalker and the jet be the only completely new design this year do nt mean that 1961 do nt see change in model action and calibers aside
