to the march mr march like benjamin szold be a clergyman although of an indeterminate denomination and marmee march like sophie szold be the competent manager of she brood of girl of whom the march have only four to the szolds five but the march girl have they counterpart in the szold girl henrietta could easily identify herself with jo march although jo be not the eldest sister neither be henrietta hoydenish like jo who frankly wish she be a boy and have deliberately shorten she name which like henrietta s be the feminine form of a boy s name but both be high-spirited and vivacious both have temper to control both love language especially english and german both be good teacher and write for publication each be she mother s assistant and confidante and each stand out conspicuously in the family picture bertha szold be more like meg the eldest march girl who learn that a woman s happy kingdom be home she high honor the art of rule it not a a queen but a wise wife

definitely jewish and the other vaguely christian the szolds like the march enjoy and love live together even in trouble time and a in the march home any young man who call on the szolds find himself confront with a phalanx of femininity which make it rather difficult to direct he particular attention to any one of they this include mamma jolly generous and pretty with whom they all fall in love just a papa have first fall in love with she mamma before he choose she and when a young man like morris jastrow have enjoy the szold hospitality he feel oblige to send he respect and he gift not
