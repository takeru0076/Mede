rather than be deceive the eye be puzzle instead of see object in space it see nothing more than a picture through 1911 and 1912 a the cubist facet-plane s tendency to adhere to the literal surface become hard and hard to deny the task of keep the surface at arm s length fall all the more to eye-undeceiving contrivance to reinforce and sometimes to replace the simulate typography braque and picasso begin to mix sand and other foreign substance with they paint the granular texture thus create likewise call attention to the reality of the surface and be effective over much large area in certain other picture however braque begin to paint area in exact simulation of wood grain or marbleizing these area by virtue of they abrupt density of pattern state the literal surface with such new and superior force that the result contrast drive the simulate print into a depth from which it could be rescue and set to shuttle again only by conventional perspective that be by be place in such relation to the form depict within the illusion that these form leave no room for the typography except near the surface the accumulation of such device however soon have the effect of telescope even while separate surface and depth the process of flatten seem inexorable and it become necessary to emphasize the surface still far in order to prevent it from fuse with the illusion it be for this reason and no other that i can see that in september 1912 braque take the radical and revolutionary step of past actual piece of imitation-woodgrain wallpaper to a draw on paper instead of try to simulate it texture in paint picasso say that he himself have already make he first collage toward the end of 1911 when he glue a piece of imitation-caning oilcloth to a painting on canvas it be true that he first collage look more analytical than braque s which would confirm the date he assign it but it be also true that braque be the consistent pioneer in the use of simulate texture a well a of typography and moreover he have already begin to broaden and simplify the facet-planes of analytical cubism a far back a the end of 1910 when we examine what each master say be he first collage we see that much the same thing happen in each it make no real difference that braque s collage be on paper and ek out in charcoal while picasso s be on canvas and ek out in oil by it great corporeal presence and it great extraneousness the affix paper or cloth serve for a seem moment to push everything else into a more vivid idea of depth than the simulate print or simulate texture have ever do but here again the surface-declaring device both overshoot and fall short of it aim for the illusion of depth create by the contrast between the affix material and everything else give way immediately to an illusion of form in bas-relief which give way in turn and with equal immediacy to an illusion that seem to contain both or neither because of the size of the area it cover the paste paper establish undepicted flatness bodily a more than an indication or sign literal flatness now tend to assert itself a the main event of the picture and the device boomerang the illusion of depth be render even more precarious than before instead of isolate the literal flatness by specify and circumscribe it the paste paper or cloth release and spread it and the artist seem to have nothing leave but this undepicted flatness with which to finish a well a start he picture the actual surface become both ground and background and it turn out suddenly and paradoxically that the only place leave for a three-dimensional illusion be in front of upon the surface in they very first collage braque and picasso draw or paint over and on the affix paper or cloth so that certain of the principal feature of they subject a depict seem to thrust out into real bas-relief space or to be about to do so while the rest of the subject remain imbed in or flat upon the surface and the surface be drive back in it very surfaceness only by this contrast in the upper center of braque s first collage fruit dish in douglas cooper s collection a bunch of grape be render with such conventionally vivid sculptural effect a to lift it practically off the picture plane the trompe-loeil illusion here be no long enclose between parallel flatnesses but seem to thrust through the surface of the draw paper and establish depth on top of it yet the violent immediacy of the wallpaper strip paste to the paper and the only lesser immediacy of block capital that simulate window lettering manage somehow to push the grape cluster back into place on the picture plane so that it do not jump at the same time the wallpaper strip themselves seem to be push into depth by the line and patch of shade charcoal upon they and by they place in relation to the block capital and these capital seem in turn to be push back by they place and by contrast with the corporeality of the woodgraining thus every part and plane of the picture keep change place in relative depth with every other part and plane and it be a if the only stable relation leave among the different part of the picture be the ambivalent and ambiguous one that each have with the surface and the same thing more or less can be say of the content of picasso s first collage in late collage of both master a variety of extraneous material be use sometimes in the same work and almost always in conjunction with every other eye-deceiving and eye-undeceiving device they can think of the area adjacent to one edge of a piece of affix material or simply of a painted-in form will be shade to pry that edge away from the surface while something will be draw paint or even paste over another part of the same shape to drive it back into depth plane define a parallel to the surface also cut through it into real space and a depth be suggest optically which be great than that establish pictorially all this expand the oscillation between surface and depth so a to encompass fictive space in front of the surface a well a behind it flatness may now monopolize everything but it be a flatness become so ambiguous and expand a to turn into illusion itself at least an optical if not properly speak a pictorial illusion depict cubist flatness be now almost completely assimilate to the literal undepicted kind but at the same time it react upon and largely transform the undepicted kind and it do so moreover without deprive the latter of it literalness rather it underpin and reinforce that literalness re-create it out of this re-creat literalness the cubist subject reemerge for it have turn out by a far paradox of cubism that the mean to an illusion of depth and plasticity have now become widely divergent from the mean of representation or image in the analytical phase of they cubism braque and picasso have not only have to minimize three-dimensionality simply in order to preserve it they have also have to generalize it to the point finally where the illusion of depth and relief become abstract from specific three-dimensional entity and be render largely a the illusion of depth and relief a such a a disembody attribute and expropriate property detach from everything not itself in order to be save plasticity have have to be isolate and a the aspect of the subject be transpose into those cluster of more or less interchangeable and contour-obliterating facet-planes by which plasticity be isolate under the cubist method the subject itself become largely unrecognizable cubism in it 1911-1912 phase which the french with justice call hermetic be on the verge of abstract art it be then that picasso and braque be confront with a unique dilemma they have to choose between illusion and representation if they opt for illusion it could only be illusion per se an illusion of depth and of relief so general and abstract a to exclude the representation of individual object if on the other hand they opt for representation it have to be representation per se representation a image pure and simple without connotation at least without more than schematic one of the three-dimensional space in which the object represent originally exist it be the collage that make the term of this dilemma clear the representational could be restore and preserve only on the flat and literal surface now that illusion and representation have become for the first time mutually exclusive alternative in the end picasso and braque plump for the representational and it would seem they do so deliberately this provide whatever real justification there be for the talk about reality but the inner formal logic of cubism a it work itself out through the collage have just a much to do with shape they decision when the small facet-planes of analytical cubism be place upon or juxtapose with the large dense shape form by the affix material of the collage they have to coalesce become synthesize into large planar shape themselves simply in order to maintain the integrity of the picture plane leave in they previous atom-like smallness they would have cut away too abruptly into depth and the broad opaque shape of paste paper would have be isolate in such a way a to make they jump out of plane large plane juxtapose with other large plane tend to assert themselves a independent shape and to the extent that they be flat they also assert themselves a silhouette and independent silhouette be apt to coincide with the recognizable contour of the subject from which a picture start if it do start from a subject it be because of this chain-reaction a much a for any other reason that be because of the grow independence of the planar unit in collage a a shape that the identity of depict object or at least part of they re-emerge in braque s and picasso s papier colle and continue to remain more conspicuous there but only a flatten silhouette than in any of they painting do wholly in oil before the end of 1913 analytical cubism come to an end in the collage but not conclusively nor do synthetic cubism fully begin there only when the collage have be exhaustively translate into oil and transform by this translation do cubism become an affair of positive color and flat interlocking silhouette whose legibility and placement create allusion to if not the illusion of unmistakable three-dimensional identity synthetic cubism begin with picasso alone late in 1913 or early in 1914 this be the point at which he finally take the lead in cubist innovation away from braque never again to relinquish it but even before that picasso have glimpse and enter for a moment a certain revolutionary path in which no one have precede he it be a though in that instant he have feel the flatness of collage a too constrict and have suddenly try to escape all the way back or forward to literal three-dimensionality this he do by use utterly literal mean to carry the forward push of the collage and of cubism in general literally into the literal space in front of the picture plane some time in 1912 picasso cut out and fold a piece of paper in the shape of a guitar to this he glue and fit other piece of paper and four taut string thus create a sequence of flat surface in real and sculptural space to which there cling only the vestige of a picture plane the affix element of collage be extrude a it be and cut off from the literal pictorial surface to form a bas-relief
