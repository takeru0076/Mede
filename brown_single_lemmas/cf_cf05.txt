buffete by swirl wind the little green biplane struggle northward between the mountain beyond northfield gulf wire whine a a cold november blast rock the silver wing but the engine roar be reassure to the pilot bundle in the open cockpit he peer ahead and grin a the railroad track come into view again below good old iron compass he think a plume of smoke rise from a central vermont locomotive which idle behind a string of gravel car and little figure that be workman labored to set the rupture roadbed to right the girder of a shatter dog river bridge lie strew for half a mile downstream vermont s main railroad line be prostrate and in the dark day after the great flood of 1927 the bad natural disaster in the state s history the little plane be it sole replacement in carry the unite state mail rain of near cloudburst proportion have fall for three full day and it be still rain on the morning of friday november 4 1927 when official of the post office department s railway mail service realize that they distribution system for vermont have be almost totally destroy overnight clerk and postmaster shoveled muck out of they office those who still have office and wonder how to move the mail the state s railroad system count mile of break bridge and miss rights-of-way it would obviously remain out of commission for week and once medicine food clothing and shelter have be provide for the flood s victim communication and the mail be the next top problem from burlington outgoing mail could be ferry across lake champlain to the railroad at port kent n y but what come in be pile up the near undisrupted end of track from boston be at concord n h when governor al smith offer new york national guard plane to fly the mail in and out of the state it seem a likely temporary solution ease burlington s bottleneck and that at montpelier too the question be where to land there be no such thing a an airport in vermont burlington aviator john j burn suggest the parade ground southwest of fort ethan allen and soon a dozen hastily-summoned national guard pilot be bring they wide-winged jenny and dehaviland two-seater to rest on the freeze sod of the military base the only available field that could be use near flood-ravaged montpelier be on the towne farm off upper main street a narrow hillside where takeoff and landing could be safely make only under light wind condition over in barre the street have be deep in swirl water and bridge be crumple and go anticipate delivery of medicine and yeast by plane granite city citizen form an airfield committee and with the aid of quarryman and the 172nd infantry vermont national guard lay out runway on wilson flat high on millstone hill the barre aviation field be set to receive it first aircraft the sunday follow the flood though the makeshift airport be ready the york state guard flyer prove unable to keep any kind of mail schedule they have courage but they meager train consist of weekend hop in good weather in and out of establish airport and the increasingly cold weather soon raise hob with the water cool engine of they world war 1 plane it seem like a good time for official to use a recently-passed law empower the post office department to contract for the transport of first class mail by air they have to act fast for letter be clog the terminal down in concord new hampshire be a flier in the right place at the right time robert s fogg a native new englander have be a world war 1 fly instructor barnstormer and one of the original planner of the concord airport tall wiry dark-haired bob fogg have already rack up one historical first in air mail history pilote a curtiss navy mf fly boat off lake winnipesaukee in 1925 he have inaugurate the original rural delivery air service in america during the excitement follow lindbergh s flight to paris early in 1927 dare devil aviator overnight become legendary hero in concord bob fogg be the most prominent new hampshire boy with wing public-spirited backer stake he to a brand-new airplane aim at put they city and state on the fly map the ship be a waco biplane one of the first two of it type to be fit with the air cool 225 wright radial engine know a the whirlwind a trim green and silver-painted craft only 22-12 foot long the waco be enter to compete in the on-to-spokane air derby of 1927 a a matter of fact fogg and he plane do nt get beyond pennsylvania in the race an engine oil leak force he down but the fly service and school he start subsequently be first step in pay off he wry-faced backer so with all this experience bob fogg be a natural choice to receive the first emergency air mail star route contract he work begin just six day after the flood by airline from concord to burlington be a distance of about 150 mile count a slight deviation for the stop at either barre or montpelier the first few day bob fogg set he plane down on towne field back of the state house when the wind be right and use wilson flat above barre when it be nt between the unsafe towne field and the long roundabout back road haul that be necessary to gain access to wilson flat arrangement at the state capital be far from satisfactory each time in the unhappy pilot push he luck beg the postal official that meet he to find a safe land place preferably on the flat-topped hill across the winooski river but fogg they counter we can nt get over there and besides you seem to make it all right here it take a tragedy to bring thing to a head after a week of precarious uphill landing and downwind takeoff fogg one day look down at the shatter yellow wreckage of an army plane strew across snow-covered towne field send to montpelier by secretary herbert hoover red cross aide reuben sleight have be kill and he pilot lt franklin wolfe badly injure with the field a blur of white the unfortunate pilot have simply fly into the hillside face with this situation postmaster charles f mckenna of montpelier go with fogg on a burlington trip and together they scout the terrain on the height of berlin a long flat know a the st john field seem to answer they purpose and since the winooski bridge be at last passable they decide to use it with a wary eye on the farmer s bull fred somers of montpelier and mr st john mark the field with a red table cloth a a wind direction indicator they tie a cotton rag to a sapling with these aid and a pair of skiis substitute for wheel on the waco bob fogg make the first land on what be now part of the barre-montpelier airport on november 21 1927 each trip see the front cockpit fill high with mail pouch during the second week of operation fogg receive a telegram from the post office department ask he to put on two airplane and make two flight daily plus one sunday trip since fogg s be a one-man one-plane fly service this mean that he would have to do both trip fly alone 600 mile a day under sub-freezing temperature condition over the week america s first star route air mail settle into a routine pattern despite the vagary of weather and the lack of ground facility and aid to navigation each morning at five fogg crawl out of bed to bundle into fly tog over the furnace register of he home always trouble by poor circulation in he foot he experiment with various combination of sock and shoe before finally adopt old-style feel farmer s boot with he sheepskin fly boot pull over they a sheep-lined leather fly suit plus helmet goggle and mitten complete he attire for the rigor of the open cockpit the airman s stock answer to be nt you cold become yes the first half hour be tough but by then i m so numb i do nt notice it a daylight begin to show through the frosty window fogg would place a call to william a shaw at the we weather station at northfield vermont for temperature and wind-velocity reading shaw could also give the flyer a pretty good idea of area visibility by a visual check of the mountain to be see from he station ceiling be judge by comparison with know mountain height and cloud position late on in the day fogg could get a good weather picture from the burlington weather bureau supervise by frank e hartwell out at the airport each morning fogg s skilled mechanic caleb marston would have the waco warm up and run in the drafty hangar he d get the engine oil flow with an electric heater under a big canvas cover wish to show that aviation be dependable and here to stay bob fogg always make a point of take off each morning on the dot of seven disregard rain snow and sleet in true postal tradition concord learn to set it clock by the rackety bark of the whirlwind s exhaust overhead sometimes the pilot have to turn back if fully block by fog but 85 % of he trip be complete plane radio be not yet available and once in the air fogg fly he ship by compass a good memory for landmark a see from above and a capacity for dead reckon and quick computation often thread through the overcast he be force to fly close to the ground by a low ceiling skim above the winooski or the white river along the line of the break railroad when drive rain or mist sock in one valley fogg would chandelle up and over to reverse course and try another one range from the ottauquechee up to danville in search of safe passage through the mountain pass the dependable wright engine be never stop on these trip it tick over smoothly idle while fogg exchange mail with the arm messenger from burlington at fort ethan allen and one from montpelier and barre at the st john field sometimes on a return trip the aviator would go upstairs high over the cloud there he d take a compass read figure he air speed and deduce that in a certain number of minute he d be over the broad meadow of the merrimack valley where it would be safe to let down through the overcast and see the ground before it hit he bob fogg do nt have today s advantage of instrument flight and ground control approach system at the end of the calculate time he d nose the waco down through the cloud bank and hope to break through where some feature of the winter landscape would be recognizable usually back in concord by noon there be just time to get partially thaw out refuel and grab a bit of mrs fogg s hot broth before start the second trip day after day fogg shuttle back and forth on he one-man air mail route until the farmer in they snowy barnyards and the road repairman come to recognize the stubby plane a they link with the rest of the country the flyer have he share of near-miss at fort ethan allen the ever-present wind off lake champlain could readily flip a puny man-made thing like an airplane if the pilot miscalculate once the soldier from the barracks have to hold the ship from blow away while fogg rev the engine and get the tail up at a nod of he head they let go turn to cup they ear against the icy slipstream track in the snow show the plane be airborne in less than a hundred foot one afternoon during a cold powdery snowstorm fogg take off for concord from the st john field
