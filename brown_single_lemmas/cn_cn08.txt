care of the little pink woman who choose to be call auntie when they reach they neighbor s house pamela say a few polite word to grace and kiss melissa lightly on the forehead the impulse prompt by a stray think of the type to which she be frequently subject these day that they might never see one another again then she turn the station wagon around and head it back down the hill with the village a she ostensible destination a she drive she think about she plan it be really quite simple so simple in fact that it might even work although pamela now in she new frame of mind be careful not to pretend too much assurance that mistake she think have cost she dearly these past few day and she want to avoid fall into any more of the trap that the mountain might set for she she must be cautious so a not to alert the scheme forest when the station wagon draw abreast of the dusty dirt road that lead up to the porch of the culver house pamela turn the wheel guide the car to it familiar park spot close to the house and stop all of she movement be careful and methodical partake of the stealth of a criminal who have plot he felony for month in advance and know exactly which step to take next in the course of the final execution of he crime she lock the ignition remove the key step out of the car and go into the house here she drop the key on a small table beside the door and go upstairs to she bedroom on she bureau lie a small brass ornament of simple design and fade engrave an object which pamela believe now have be the property of she great-grandfather major hiram munroe culver he have belong to this land and perhaps have desecrate it and this be the only material symbol that remain of he if she pamela be be hold responsible for he crime then hers must be the final act of expiation she would return this symbol to the mountain a one pour seed back into the soil every spring or a ancient fertility cult demand annual human sacrifice slowly and thoughtfully she slip the ornament into the pocket of she slack move down the stairs and out of the house there be only one place where the mountain might receive she that unnamed unnameable pool harbored in it secret bosom atonement if atonement be possible could only be make at that sacred sacrificial basin it be there that she would have to enact she renunciation beg forgiveness perhaps it be insane pamela think perhaps it be all a vividly conceive dream but she be catch in it and she face the terrible possibility that if it be a dream it be one from which she might never awaken face the forest now she who have not dare to enter it before walk between two tree at random and head in what she believe be the direction of the pool she remember little of she previous journey there with grace and she could but hope that she dedication to she mission would enable she to accomplish it the forest be open and freely welcome extend an enchant hand the ground be cover with soft pine needle and the slope be gentle bird chirp and chatter in the tree and the sun all dewy-eyed and soft caress she shoulder warmly from time to time it be not think pamela such an evil place after all no wonder melissa respond so completely to it beckon perhaps she have no reason to fear these tree that whisper they secret above she head a she pass be it not possible after all that the forest be in league with she and she child that it sympathy lie with the culvers that she have err in fail to understand this pamela feel calm and peaceful a she walk along the slight flutter that have disturb the motion of she heart when she enter the forest be go now and even the dim grove of tree through which she occasionally pass do not reawaken she fear she regard they a sign that she be near the glen she seek and she be glad to at last be do something positive in she unenunciated undefined struggle with the mountain and it darkling inhabitant have persist too long in deliberate ignorance and denial of the force that threaten she pamela be relieve now to admit they potency and to be take definite step toward grapple with they a few day ago she would have think such an expedition a this utterly ridiculous today on the contrary it seem utterly reasonable she do not pause to consider what she would do if she plan should fail she direct all of she mental and physical energy toward achieve this one goal if a she walk she step fumble from time to time she choose to ignore that omen if the slope grow steep and the grove more dim she try not to heed success depend upon maintain she equanimity she must be poise and proud and unafraid in order to prove to the mountain that she be in earnest the forest take on an impersonal aspect it do not care what sort of person prowl it wood pluck at it bark or strip the berry from it bush unconcerned indifferent unmotivated the forest be simply there fight man s depredation with more abundant growth and man s folly with it own musical even laughter red man or white man pacifist or killer the forest would accept they all know that it could thrive equally well on slaughter and beneficence know that it ageless mass would always dwarf the short span of time allot to any man pamela shake she head she must not think about time that be another one of those trap in she grim pursuit of tranquillity pamela focus she thought on she husband if when this be all over she find the word to tell he about it she wonder if he would ever understand how could he comprehend she need when he himself be innocent indian ghost would not impinge upon he night nor would he day be haunt by the dimly-outlined ill-conceived figure of she benighted ancestor he bright daylight mind would whistle away such image they would not dare to face he scoff pamela be glad jim be nowhere near he presence would have interfere with she duty the mountainside grow steep and she slip once or twice on the smooth pine needle the tree huddle more closely together they limb and leave intertwine in a coarse curtain against the sun bush and vine abet the rock in form thorny detour for the struggle strange and without the direct light of the sun to act a compass pamela could no long be positive of she direction nevertheless she continue to move upward she be sure she would reach the pool by climb and she cling to that belief despite the increase number of obstacle the forest have become an alien world where she strive alone unprotected unguided to deal with whatever hindrance be offer it be a bold dark castle of pine bough that stand like a medieval fortress eclipse the sun and human time at one and the same time she be within it but still search for the drawbridge that would give she entry silence come into the forest a solid be that clap it hand over the murmur mouth of the bird and the whisper comfort of the tree silence walk at pamela s side it presence numbingly close yet too far for she to hear silence stand in front of she wait and in back of she block she retreat she stumble over the root of a tree that protrude maliciously above the earth in spite of she attempt to preserve she balance she fall bruise she arm on a naked stone for a moment she could not catch she breath and then she breath return in short frighten spasm she lift herself to she foot laboriously she start to brush the dirt and bit of leave off she clothe she arm bleed slightly and the offend

quite still try to focus upon a direction in which to turn a path to follow a clue to guide she she be stand in a thick grove the tree be crowd so closely together that they branch overlap virtually shut out the sun completely the earth smell moist and pungent a it might in a cave deprive of the cleanse effect of the sun s ray she have the feel that under the moulder leave there would be the body of dead animal quietly decay and give they soil back to the mountain the think make pamela shudder a terrible chill sweep through the grove not a breeze exactly but a pocket of icy air that settle with a loathsome familiarity upon the deep confine of the grove catch pamela in a leer embrace there be a peculiar density about it a thick substance that could be sense but never identify never actually perceive where before have she feel or dream or imagine such a scene she already know this unwholesome chill atmosphere that be somehow grotesquely alive it enclose she clammy hand and twine around she ankle it creep into the open neck of she blouse and slide down she body seep into she flesh through all the quiver pore of she skin it crawl across she breast suffocate the life in she nipple it circle she thigh explore with it icy tentacle it enter she body with the ghastly intimacy of an incubus and it particle spread creep crawl join themselves into steel band that constrict she knee so tightly that they ache stifle she lung so that she breath come in harsh gasp clutch she throat and suck up the moisture in she mouth so that she tongue be dry and hard and stick to the roof of she mouth and she tooth be clench together in the rigid fixture of she jaw she have to get away from here before this demoniac possession swallow up the liquid of she eye and sink into the fibers of she brain deprive she of reason and sight but she do not know which way to go the shadow of the tree engulf she foreclose every possible exit from the grove she have be snare here by a vile sensuality that writhe around she throat in ever-tightening circle she could not scream for even if a sound could take shape within she parch mouth who would hear who would listen do the mountain listen pamela grope blindly she have to escape she have to move in some direction any direction that would take she away from this evil place she thrust forward through the shadow and the tree that resist she and try to fling she back she own body protest ache painfully where the blood in she vein have congeal where cold demon wisp still cling and caress every movement she make seem unnecessarily noisy twig crack loudly under she foot bush swish and scratch at she slack tree branch snap a she push they ruthlessly away from she
