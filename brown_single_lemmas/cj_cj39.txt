but briefly the top configuration must be examine for it inference then the fact that the low channel line be pierce have far forecast significance and then the application of the count rule to the width horizontally of the configuration give we an intial estimate of the probable depth of the decline the very idea of there be count rule imply that there be some sort of proportion to be expect between the amount of congestive activity and the extent of the breakaway run up or run down movement this expectation be what really sell point and figure but there be no positive and consistently demonstrable relationship in the strict sense experience will show that only the vagu generality apply and in fine these merely dwell upon a relationship between the duration and intensity of event after all too much do not happen too suddenly nor do very little take long the advantage and disadvantage of these two type of chart bar chart and point and figure chart remain the subject of fairly good-natured litigation among they respective professional advocate with both method enjoy in common one irrevocable merit they be both trend-following method even if we strip they respective claim to the bare minimum the odds still favor they both for the trend in effect be always more likely to continue than to reverse of course many more thing be chart besides price the forego have be method of chart price but now let we look at some of the other index that be customarily chart and which be look to for they forecast ability the quest for method the search for forecast formula be ceaseless correlation have be work up between the load of freight car and the course of stock price the theory behind this be of course fundamentalist in character a the number of report freight car loading increase this be take to indicate increase industrial activity and consequently increase stock earnings imply fat dividend and imply therefore increase stock market price we now know that thing rarely ever work out in such cut-and-dried fashion and that car loading while perhaps interest enough be nevertheless not the magic formula that will always turn before stock price turn but the quest for such an index go on ceaselessly with all manner of investor and speculator participate range from the sedate institutional type virtually to the proverbial shoe-string operator all seek doggedly studiously daily and often nightly for the enchanting index that will foretell the eternal secret which way will the market move up or down it recall to mind the quest of olden time for the fountain of youth a quest heavily invest in during the day of wooden ship just a heavily invest be the endeavor of multitude of modern man who carry on the quest for the enchanting index the quest offer career much of this go on in office high up in wall street s lofty wind-swept tower there sit man who make move average of weekly volume monthly average of price-earnings ratio ratio of the number of advance to the number of decline ratio of an individual stock s performance to overall market performance ratio of rise price volume to fall price volume odd-lot index and what not they be concern with all thing trade in security bond cocao coffee soybean cotton tin oats etc and along chicago s west jackson boulevard la salle street and around the merchandise mart plaza there sit man who chart crop report who divide the number of report lady-bugs by the number of report green-bugs and the number of hog by the amount of corn they plot the open interest curve rainfall curve and they even divide democratic congressman by republican congressman all these thing and countless more enter into they calculation and yet the enchanting index remain non-forthcoming not at any rate in the full sense of the word the market be far too subtle and the last word in these endeavor will doubtless never be write for the enchanting index be about a nebulous a the fountain of youth but whereas civilize man no long pursue the fountain they never abandon they pursuit of the enchanting index we mention odd-lot index a few paragraph ago in the stock market the normal trade package be a hundred share just a 5000 bushel be the standard grain contract package a stock transaction for less than a hundred share be execute via a special odd-lot broker on the floor of the exchange this result in a separate record be make distinguish these trade from the overall volume of trade accord to the theory underlie odd-lot index the trader who trade odd lot be most likely a small trader one who can nt afford to trade round lot or to use the cynical phraseology of one odd-lot index enthusiast they represent a sample of the least sophisticate echelon of trader fall most easily prey to an adverse market movement for this rank of trader can least afford to lose virtually anything the odd-lot trader do marketwise be take to exemplify the wrong thing to do figure report the volume of odd-lot purchase and odd-lot sales be release by the stock exchange and carry in the newspaper odd-lot index observer then make graph of the data accord to they particular statistical recipe they might for example plot it exactly a be or they might make ten day move average of it or long move average or they might simply plot the ratio of odd-lot purchase to odd-lot sales the particular recipe be a matter of individual taste the data be now interpret in conjunction with a price chart usually of a popular stock average towards the end of an intermediate or major rise while the top be form on the price chart it be frequently observe that the odd-lot buy increase sharply this warn the chartist that the formation in progress be quite likely to be a top similarly at the opposite end of the market cycle towards the end of an intermediate or major decline usually while the bottom be be form on the price chart it be characteristic that an increase be notice in odd-lot sell again alert the chartist that a bottom be become a great likelihood thus in the aggregate the odd-lot trader be one who buy at the top and sell at the bottom notwithstanding occasional individual exception while it have long be know in general that the public be always wrong the use of odd-lot index now put the adage on a statistical basis one might well wonder why the public be always wrong and the question raise be about a awkward a the one concern with the chicken and the egg which come first be it really that the public buy at the top and not that the market top out when the public buy and the converse at bottom do the public usually sell at bottom or do the market usually bottom out when the public sell we have be use the word public in quotation mark that be in it vernacular connotation with reference to the odd-lot index theory obviously someone have to sell in order for someone to buy and vice versa and while all concern be member of the literal public somewhat less than all concern although still a majority form the quotation mark public and the public minus the public leave the so-called sophisticate element the element on the other end of the public s transaction this element be often call strong hand strong hand differ from weak hand in that they operation be the primary mover they initiate campaign so to speak even if this initiation be diffuse among they and they concerted action only psychologically organize strong hand act weak hand react strong hand move first weak hand ask what be go on when strong hand buy they be able to buy more and they do it even in the face of bearish news report they be able to sit more patiently with what they have buy needless to say strong hand be not eager to be join by weak hand for this increase the risk that they will have to absorb what these weak hand unload on the way up at high price during the run-up phase of the campaign certain badly disillusion market critic be often apt to feel that there be something somehow unfair dirty or even thoroughly criminal about this interplay of competitive force but after all can anyone imagine a market wherein the reverse of these thing be true try to imagine a market in which only a minority of trader would lose and the majority would make consistent profit how much and how many profit could a majority take out of the loss of a few moreover the taunt concern the sophisticate echelon and it allege erudition be put to test during every campaign and accrue only upon result not before it quite often happen that campaign go askew result in a most unflattering deterioration of strong hand into played-out hand just a a member of a former campaign s public may emerge flatteringly right the next time membership in the echelon fluctuate too the study of odd-lot index be somehow akin to the spectacle of a man try to outfox he own shadow what with all observer try to get on the side of the few at the same time the usefulness of this study and of configuration analysis a well decline in direct proportion to the dissemination of it use it have to by virtue of the very dictionary definition of the word few diametric opposition must persist a to the future course of price if there be to persist a market at all and the few must win what the many lose for the opposite arrangement would not support market a we know they at all and be in fact unimaginable there need be no squeamishness about admit this anyone still doubt that this be the only way market can be be invite to try to imagine a market wherein the majority consistently win what the minority lose mr john magee whose work have be discuss in this chapter be quote in a new yorker magazine profile a say of course you have to remember it s a good thing for we chartist that there be nt more of we if you get too many people invest by this method they operation would begin to affect stock price and thus throw the chart off the method would become self-defeating mr alexander h wheelan s study help in point and figure technique tell the reader we assure you that the total number of people use this method of market analysis be a very small portion of the sum total of those operate in the security and commodity market what with trader trade for so many different objective and what with there be so many unique and individualize market theory and trade technique in use and more come into use all the time it be hard to imagine how any particular theory or technique could acquire enough fan to invalidate itself nevertheless all theory and technique lead but to one of two possible mode of expression if they lead to a market committment at all in the final analysis then the user become either a bull or a bear in a give instance notwithstanding any amount of forethought and calculation however elaborate thus while he theory or technique may not be oversubscribed it be commonplace for bullish and bearish position to become temporarily over-subscribed though the method of decide may be profound and diverse the possible conclusion remain but two chapter 6 more method the hoax the purpose set forth at the begin of this book be first to introduce the reader to a general background knowledge of the various type and capability of the forecast method already in use so that he might then be in a position to evaluate for himself the validity of the rather astonish empirical correlation that be to follow and to appraise the forecast that it interpretation suggest for the future of farm price over the year immediately ahead
