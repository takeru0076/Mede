oersted s boyhood represent a minimal chance of either attain greatness or serve he people so well and over so long a span of life he be bear in the small danish town of rudkoebing on the island of langeland in the south-central part of denmark on august 14 1777 he father soeren be the village apothecary whose slender income make it difficult to feed he family let alone educate they in a town without even a school the two old boy han and ander he junior by a year therefore go daily to the home of a warm and friendly wigmaker nearby for instruction in german he wife teach the two boy to read and write danish other brother late join they for instruction with oldenburg the wigmaker and also arithmetic be add to bible read german and danish in the informal curriculum oldenburg s contribution be soon exhaust and the boy have to turn to a wide circle of the town s learn such a the pastor to supplement the simple teach from the town surveyor han learn draw and mathematics and from a university student some academic subject the mayor of the town teach they english and french whatever han or ander learn separately they pass on to each other they read every book that they could borrow in the village at 12 han be sufficiently mature to help he father in the apothecary shop which help stimulate he interest in medicine and science he early love for literature and history remain with he for he entire life in 1793 the brother decide to enter the university of copenhagen found in 1479 and the follow spring find they at the university prepare to matriculate for the autumn session while han devote himself to the science of medicine physics and astronomy he brother study law the brother continue to help each other during they study share a joint purse lodge together in the dormitory and dine together at the home of they aunt they supplement they income by small government assistance by tutor and economize wherever they could so impressive be those serious year of study at the university that han late write to be perfectly free the young man must revel in the great kingdom of think and imagination there be a struggle there in which if he fall it be easy for he to rise again there be freedom of utterance there which draw after it no irreparable consequence on society i live in this onward-driving contest where each day overcome a new difficulty gain a new truth or banish a previous error he openly proclaim he pleasure in lecture and write about science in this third year at the university han in 1797 be award the first important token of recognition a gold medal for he essay on limit of poetry and prose he complete he train in pharmacy also take he degree with high honor in 1797 and in 1799 be award the degree of doctor of philosophy along with a prize for an essay in medicine he propose a fresh theory of alkali which late be accept in chemical practice ferment of scientific activity han student day be at a time when europe be in a new intellectual ferment follow the revolution in america and in france germany and italy be rise from divisive nationalism and a strong wave of intellectual awareness be sweep the continent the new century open with oersted begin he professional career in charge of an apothecary shop in copenhagen and a lecturer at the university he be stir by the announcement of volta s discovery of chemical electricity and he immediately apply the voltaic pile to experiment with acid and alkali the follow year he devote to the customary wanderjahr travel in germany france and the netherlands meet the philosopher schelling fichte and tieck he also meet count rumford bear benjamin thompson in woburn mass who be then serve the elector of bavaria and the physicist ritter these be oersted s main contact in science from gottingen 1801 where he stay for 10 day he write the first question ask everywhere be about galvanism a everybody be curious to see the battery of glass tube i have invent i have have quite a small one make here of four glass tube in copenhagen i use 30 and intend to carry it with i oersted join ritter at jena and stay with he for 3 week continue they correspondence after he leave with ritter he be expose to the fantastic profusion of idea that storm through he host s fertile but disorganize mind oersted remodeled ritter s note into an essay in french which be submit to the institut de france for it annual prize of 3000 franc the sound discovery of this quixotic genius be so dilute by those of fantasy that the prize be never award to he in may 1803 ritter in another flight of fancy write to oersted a letter that contain a remarkable prophecy he relate event on earth to periodic celestial phenomenon and indicate that the year of maximum inclination of the ecliptic coincide with the year of important electrical discovery thus 1745 correspond to the invention of the leiden jar by kleist 1764 that of the electrophorus by wilcke 1782 produce the condenser of volta and 1801 the voltaic pile ritter proceed you now emerge into a new epoch in which late in the year 1819 or 1820 you will have to reckon this we might well witness ritter die in 1810 and oersted not only live to see the event occur but be the author of it in 1803 oersted return to copenhagen and apply for the university s chair in physics but be reject because he be probably consider more a philosopher than a physicist however he continue experiment and lecture publish the result of he experiment in german and danish periodical in 1806 he ambition be realize and he become professor of physics at the copenhagen university though not realize full professorship ordinarius until 1817 during oersted s attendance at the university it be poorly equip with physical apparatus for experiment in the science he be however fortunate in he contact with prof j g l manthey 1769-1842 teacher of chemistry who in addition to he academic chair be also proprietor of the lion pharmacy in copenhagen where oersted assist he manthey maintain a valuable collection of physical and chemical apparatus which be at oersted s disposal during and after he graduation in 1800 manthey go abroad and oersted be appoint manager of the lion pharmacy in february 1801 oersted do manage to experiment with physical apparatus and report experiment make with a voltaic battery of 600 plate of zinc and silver and of late experiment with a battery of 60 plate of zinc and lead in the follow year 1803 oersted simultaneously with davy discover that acid increase the strength of a voltaic battery more than do salt eager a he be to pursue this promise line he be so load down with the management of the pharmacy and lecture in the medical and pharmaceutical faculty at the university that he could devote only sunday afternoon to galvanize he assume he academic career with the same intensity and thoroughness that have mark every step in he rise from boyhood the university be the only one in denmark and the status of professor represent the upper social level he broad interest in literary political and philosophical movement open many door to he he friend be numerous and they tie to he be strong the year 1812 and 1813 see he in germany and france again but on this visit to berlin he do not seek out the philosopher a he have on he first journey in berlin he publish he view of the chemical law of nature in german and this be issue in french translation paris 1813 under the title recherches sur lidentite des force chimiques et electriques a work hold in very high esteem by the new generation of research chemist he interest in find a relationship between voltaic electricity and magnetism be here first indicate chapter 8 be entitle on magnetism and in it be include such remark a one have always be tempt to compare the magnetic force with the electrical force the great resemblance between electrical and magnetic attraction and repulsion and the similarity of they law necessarily would bring about this comparison it be true that nothing have be find comparable with electricity by communication but the phenomenon observe have such a degree of analogy to those depend on electrical distribution that one could not find the slight difference the form of galvanic activity be halfway between the magnetic form and the electrical form there force be more latent than in electricity and less than in magnetism but in such an important question we would be satisfy if the judgment be that the principal objection to the identity of force which produce electricity and magnetism be only a difficulty and not a thing which be contrary to it one could also add to these analogy that steel lose it magnetism by heat which prove that steel become a good conductor through a rise in temperature just a electrical body do it be also find that magnetism exist in all body of nature a prove by bruckmann and coulomb by that one feel that magnetic force be a general a electrical force an attempt should be make to see if electricity in it most latent stage have any action on the magnet a such he plan and intent be clearly chart oersted return in 1814 and resume an active part in university and political discussion in one debate he support the freedom of judgment a oppose to dogma in another he hold that the practice of science be in fact an act of religious worship he continue a a popular lecturer he devise a detonate fuse in which a short wire be cause to glow by an electric current in 1819 under royal command he undertake a very successful geological expedition to bornholm one of the danish island be one of three scientist in the expedition it be with the assistance of one of the member of this expedition lauritz esmarch that oersted succeed in produce light by create an electric discharge in mercury vapor through which an electric current be make to flow together they also develop a new form of voltaic cell in which the wooden trough be replace by one of copper thereby produce strong current esmarch be among those who witness oersted s first demonstration of he discovery discovery of electromagnetism the association between electric both electrostatic and voltaic force and magnetic force have be recognize by investigator for many decade electrical literature contain numerous reference to lightning that have magnetize iron and have alter the polarity of compass needle in the late 1700 s beccaria and van marum among other have magnetize iron by send an electrostatic charge through it beccaria have almost stumble on a lead to the relationship between electricity and magnetism when a discharge from a leyden jar be send transversally through a piece of watch-spring steel make it end magnetic the result magnetic effect prove strong than when the discharge be make lengthwise the experiment of romagnosi and other have already be note but no one have determine the cause-and-effect relationship between these two primary force oersted s own early experiment be unimpressive possibly because he have like other experimenter lay the conduct wire across the compass needle instead of parallel with it the sequence of event lead to he important discovery still remain ambiguous but it seem that one of the advance student at the university relate that the first direct event that lead to the publication of oersted s discovery occur during a private lecture make before a group of other advance student in the spring of 1820 at this lecture oersted happen to place the conduct wire over and parallel to a magnetic needle
