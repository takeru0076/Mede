highly confuse picture but since 1927 researcher dig into ancient court record and legal file have be able to find illuminate piece of information not enough to do away with all doubt but sufficient to give a fairly accurate picture of the event of the voyage historian have have two reason for persist so long in they investigation first they want to clarify a tantalize bizarre enigma second they believe it important to determine the fate of the captain a man whose name be permanently stamp on we map on american town and county on a great american river and on half a million square mile of arctic sea the name henry hudson this be the story of he last tragic voyage a nearly a we be able or ever probably will be able to determine the sail in the spring of 1610 be hudson s fourth in four year each time he objective have be the same a direct water passage from western europe to the far east in 1607 and 1608 the english muscovy company have send he northward to look for a route over the north pole or across the top of russia twice he have fail and the muscovy company indicate it would not back he again in 1609 the dutch east india company hire hudson give he two learn geographer fit he out with a ship call the half moon and supply he with dutch sailor this time he turn westward to the middle atlantic coast of north america he chief discovery be important the great north late the hudson river but it produce no northwest passage when the half moon put in at dartmouth england in the fall of 1609 word of hudson s finding leak out and english interest in he revive the government forbid hudson to return to amsterdam with he ship he thereupon go to london and spend the winter talk to man of wealth by springtime he be support by a rich merchant syndicate under the patronage of henry prince of wale he have obtain and provision a veteran ship call the discovery and have recruit a crew of twenty-one the large he have ever command the purpose of this fourth voyage be clear a century of exploration have establish that a great land mass north and south america lie between europe and the indies one by one the opening in the coast that promise a passage through have be explore and discard in fact hudson s sail up the great north river have dispose of one of the last hope but there remain one mysterious unexplored gap far to the north nearly twenty-five year before captain john davis have note a he sail near the arctic circle a very great gulf the water whirl and roar a it be the meet of tide he name this open between baffin island and labrador the furious overfall late it be to be call hudson strait in 1602 george waymouth in the same little discovery that hudson now command have sail 300 mile up the strait before he frighten man turn the ship back hudson now propose to sail all the way through and test the sea beyond for the long-sought waterway even hudson experience in arctic sail and determine a he be must have have qualm a he slide down the thame ahead be perilous ice-filled water on previous voyage it have be in precisely such dangerous situation that he have fail a a leader and captain on the second voyage he have turn back at the freeze island of novaya zemlya and meekly give the crew a certificate state that he do so of he own free will which be obviously not the case on the third voyage a near-mutiny rise from a quarrel between dutch and english crew member on the half moon have almost force he to head the ship back to amsterdam in mid-atlantic bad he present crew include five man who have sail with he before of only one could he be sure young john hudson he second son the mate robert juet who have keep the journal on the half moon be experience but he be a bitter old man ready to complain or desert at any opportunity philip staffe the ship s carpenter be a good worker but perversely independent arnold lodley and michael perse be like the rest lukewarm ready to swing against hudson in a crisis but man will to sail at all into water where wooden ship could be crush like egg be hard to find hudson know he have to use these man a long a he remain an explorer and he refuse to be anything else it be believe that hudson be relate to other seafaring man of the muscovy company and be train on company ship he be a londoner marry with three son the common misconception that he be dutch and that he first name be hendrik stem from dutch document of he third voyage in 1610 hudson be probably in he early forties a good navigator a stubborn voyager but otherwise fatally unsuited to he choose profession hudson s first error of the fourth voyage occur only a few mile down the thame there at the river s edge wait one henry greene whom hudson list a a clerk greene be in actuality a young ruffian from kent who have break with he parent in order to keep the company he prefer pimp pander and whore he be not the sort of sailor hudson want he backer to see on board and he have greene wait at gravesend where the discovery pick he up for the first three week the ship skirt up the east coast of great britain then turn westward on may 11 she reach iceland poor wind and fog lock she up in a harbor the crew call lousie bay the subsequent two-week wait make the crew quarrelsome with hudson look on he protege greene pick a fight with the ship s surgeon edward wilson the issue be settle on shore greene win and wilson remain ashore determine to catch the next fish boat back to england with difficulty hudson persuade he to rejoin the ship and they sail from iceland early in june the discovery pass desolation southern greenland and in mid-june enter the furious overfall float ice bear down from the north and west fog hang over the route constantly turbulent tide rise a much a fifty foot the ship s compass be useless because of the nearness of the magnetic north pole a the berg grow large hudson be force to turn south into what be now ungava bay an inlet of the great strait after find that it coast lead nowhere however he turn north again toward the main ice-filled passageway and the crew at first uneasy then frighten rebel the trouble be at least partly juet s do for week he have be say that hudson s idea of sail through to java be absurd the great crush ice mass come into view make he sound like the voice of pure reason a group of sailor announce to hudson that they would sail no far instead of quell the dissension a many captain of the era would have do sir francis drake lop a man s head off under similar circumstance hudson decide to be reasonable he go to he cabin and emerge carry a large chart which he set up in view of the crew patiently he explain what he know about they course and they objective when hudson have finish the town meet break down into a general wordy argument one man remark that if he have a hundred pound he would give ninety of they to be back in england up speak carpenter staffe who say he would nt give ten pound to be home the statement be effective the meet break up hudson be free to sail on all through july the discovery pick she way along the 450-mile-long strait avoid ice and rocky island on august 3 two massive headland rear out of the mist great gateway never before so far a hudson know see by european to starboard be a cape a thousand foot high patch with ice and snow populate by thousands of scream sea bird to port be a point 200 foot high rise behind to a precipice of 2000 foot hudson name the cape digges and wolstenholme for two of he backer hudson point the discovery down the east coast of the newly discover sea now call hudson bay confident he be on he way to the warm water of the pacific after three week swift sail however the ship enter an area of shallow marsh and river delta the ship halt the great sea to the westwards be a dead end this must have be hudson s black discovery for he seem to sense at once that before he be no south sea but the solid bulk of the north american continent this be the bitter end and hudson seem to know he be destined to failure feverishly he try to brush away this intuition north and south east and west back and forth he sail in the land-locked bay plow furiously forward until land appear then turn to repeat the process day after day week after week hundreds of mile to the north the route back to england through the furious overfall be again fill with ice the man be at first puzzle then anger by the aimless tack once more juet s complaint be the loud hudson s reply be to accuse the mate of disloyalty juet demand that hudson prove he charge in an open trial the trial be hold september 10 hudson preside hear juet s defense then call for testimony from crew member juet have make plentiful enemy several man step forward hand on bible seaman lodley and carpenter staffe swear that juet have try to persuade they to keep musket and sword in they cabin cook bennett mathues say juet have predict bloodshed on the ship other add that juet have want to turn the ship homeward hudson depose juet and cut he pay the new mate be robert bylot talent but inexperience there be other shift and pay cut accord to the way individual have conduct themselves the important result however be that juet and francis clemens the depose boatswain become hudson s swear enemy a hudson resume he desperate criss-crossing of the little bay every incident lessen the crew s respect for he once after the discovery lie for a week in rough weather hudson order the anchor raise before the sea have calm just a it be be haul inboard a sea hit the ship michael butt and adame moore be throw off the capstan and badly injure the anchor cable would have be lose overboard but philip staffe be on hand to sever it with he axe
