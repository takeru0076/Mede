recognition of the responsibility involve in care for two baby show sign of become a disable problem the result dramatically visible in a matter of day in the family s disrupt daily function be a phobic-like fear that some terrible harm would befall the second twin whose birth have not be anticipate soon mrs b s fear threaten to burst into a full-blown panic concern the welfare of the entire family inability to care for the other child difficulty in feed the baby who seem colicky bone-weary fatigue repeat cry episode and short temper reflect the family s helplessness in cope with the stressful situation clearly this be a family in crisis mrs b compare she feeling of weakness to she feeling of weakness and helplessness at the time of she mother s death when she be eight a well a she subsequent anger at she father for remarry she previous traumatic experience flash through she mind a if they have happen yesterday on the anniversary of she father s death she pour out with agonize tear she feeling of guilt about not have attend he funeral in the family s own word during the third of twelve visit they have reach the crisis peak either the situation will give or we will break direct confrontation and acceptance of mrs b s anger against the second baby soon dissipate she fear of annihilation abreaction of she anxiety and guilt concern the death of she parent when link up with she current feeling of anger and she fear of loss abandonment and annihilation produce far relief of tension in a joint interview mr and mrs b be help to understand the mean of a young son s wander away from home in term of he feeling of displacement in reaction to the arrival of the twin the father accurately perceive the child s need not only respect they a worthy of he attention but immediately satisfy they by take he on he lap along with the twin say i have a big lap there be room for you too johnnie simultaneously a variety of environmental support a calm but not too motherly homemaker referral for temporary economic aid intelligent use of nurse care accompaniment to the well-baby clinic for medical advice on the twin feed problem combine to prevent far development of predictable pathological mechanism follow-up visit of the nurse and social worker indicate continue success in the care of the new baby a well a a mark improvement in the family s day-to-day mental health and social function a see in the b family there must be an attempt to help the client develop conscious awareness of the problem especially in the absence of a formal request for assistance the lack of awareness usually spring from deep but disguise anxiety often assume the superficial guise of not know or not care the unhealthy use of denial in the initial reaction to a stress must be handle through the medium of a positive control transference in general the approach be more active than passive more out-reaching than reflective while some regression be inevitable it be discourage rather than encourage so that the transference do not follow the stage of plan regression associate with certain casework adaptation of the psychoanalytic model for insight therapy to establish an emotionally meaningful relationship the worker must demonstrate actual or potential helpfulness immediately preferably within the first interview by meet the client s specific need these need usually concern the reduction of guilt and some relief of tension the initial interview must be therapeutic rather than purely exploratory in an information-seeking sense in this relationship-building stage the worker must communicate confidence in the client s ability to deal with the problem in so do he implicitly offer the positive contagion of hope a a kind of maturational dynamic to counteract feeling of helplessness and hopelessness generally associate with the first stage of stress impact thus the client receive enough ego support to engage in constructive effort on he own behalf here there be a specific preventive component which apply in a more generalize sense to any casework situation we be prevent or avert pathogenic phenomenon such a undue regression unhealthy suppression and repression excessive use of denial and cripple guilt turn against the self while some suppression and some denial be not only necessary but healthy the worker s clinical knowledge must determine how these defense be be use what healthy shift in defensive adaptation be indicate and when effort at bring about change can be most effectively time in steer the family toward ego-adaptive and away from maladaptive response the worker use time-honored focus casework technique of specific emotional support clarification and anticipatory guidance over a relatively short period of time usually about four to twelve week the worker must be able to shift the focus back and forth between immediate external stressful exigency precipitate stress and the key emotionally relevant issue underlie problem which be often in a dramatic preconscious breakthrough reactivate by the crisis situation and hence once again amenable to resolution though there be obviously nothing new about these technique they do challenge the worker s skill to articulate they precisely on the spot and on the basis of quick and accurate diagnostic assessment then too the utmost clinical flexibility be necessary in judiciously combine carefully time family-oriented home visit single and group office interview and appropriate telephone follow-up call if the worker be to be genuinely accessible and if the predict unhealthy outcome be to be actually avert in accordance with the principle of preventive intervention in addition in many case a variety of concrete social resource homemaker day care medical and financial aid must be reasonably available for the reality support need to bolster the family in it individual and collective cope and integrative effort at certain critical stage and only for sound diagnostic reason it may be important to accompany family member in they use of these resource if they problem-solving behavior be to be constructive rather than defeat while expensive in time and involve a great deal of adaptation on the part of the worker in term of he willingness to leave the sanctity of he office and enter actively into the client s life technique of accompaniment be find to be of tremendous value when in the service of specific preventive objective finally whatever the technique use a twin goal be common to all preventive casework service to cushion or reduce the force of the stress impact while at the same time to encourage and support family member to mobilize and use they ego capacity have outline an approach to the theory and practice of preventive casework we now address ourselves to we final question what place should brief crisis-oriented preventive casework occupy in we total spectrum of service we should first recognize we tendency to develop a hierarchy of value locate brief treatment at the bottom and long-term intensive service at the top instead of see the service a part of a continuum each important in it own right this problem be perhaps a old a social casework itself almost three decade ago bertha reynolds undertake a study of short-contact interview because of she conviction that short-term casework have an important but neglect place in we network of social service she conclusion have be bear out in the experience of many practitioner short-contact interview be neither a truncate nor a telescope experience but be of the same essential quality a the so-called intensive case work thus casework involve a limit number of interview be still to be regard in term of the quality of service render rather than of the quantity of time expend that we be experience an upsurge of interest in the many formulation and preventive adaptation of brief treatment in social casework be evident from even a small sample of current literature especially noteworthy be levinger s find that the length of treatment per se be not a reliable indicator of successful outcome accord to a number of study the important predictor be the nature and management of the client s anxiety a well a the accessibility of the help person for example the level of improvement note in a recent experiment with a short course of immediate treatment for parent-child relationship problem compare favorably with the result report by typical child guidance clinic where the hour spend in purely diagnostic study may equal or exceed the number of hour devote to actual treatment interview in the experimental project of startle significance too be the assertion that it be possible to carry out this program with only a 6 percent attrition rate a compare with a rate of 59 percent report for a comparable group of family who be receive help in traditionally operate child guidance service these report refer to a level of secondary prevention in a child guidance clinic approach by the customary route of voluntary referral by the family or by other professional people similarity to the approach which i have describe be evident in the prompt establishment of a help relationship quick appraisal of key issue and the immediate mobilization of treatment plan a the essential dynamics in help to far the ego s cope effort in deal with the interplay of inner and outer stress while there be many different possibility for the time of casework intervention the experiment recently report from a variety of traditional setting all point up the importance of an immediate response to the client s initial need for help in some program treatment be concentrate over a short period of time while in other after the initial contact be establish flexible space of interview have be experimentally use with apparent success willingness to take the risk of early and direct interpretation with the proviso that if the interpretation be too threaten the worker can withdraw be another prominent feature in these effort i aim in mention this factor obviously be not to give license to wild therapy but rather to encourage we to use the time-honored clinical casework skill we already possess and to use they with great confidence precision and professional pride though there be obviously great need for continue experimentation with various type of short-term intervention to far effort in develop an operational definition of prevention at the secondary or perhaps in some instance primary level the place of short-term intervention have already be document by a number of investigator in a wide variety of setting woodward for example have emphasize the need for a broad spectrum of service include very brief service in connection with critical situation ideally brief treatment should be arrive at a a treatment of choice rather than a a treatment of chance moreover the shortage of treatment resource and the chronically persistent shortage of mental health manpower force we to innovate additional refinement of preventive intervention technique to make service more widely available and on a more effective basis to more people far research in the mean of crisis a experience by the consumer of traditional social casework service include attempt to develop a typology of family structure crisis problem reaction mechanism and differential treatment approach and the establishment of new experimental program be imperative social need which should command the good effort of caseworker in collaboration with community planner we literature be already replete with a fantastic number of suggestion for preventive agency program range from the immediately practical to the globally utopian probably in the immediate future we will have to settle for middle-range effort that fall short of utopian model increase experimentation with multipurpose agency especially those that combine afresh the traditional function of family and child welfare service hold rich promise for the future for example child welfare experience abound with case in which the parental request for substitute care be precipitate by a crisis event which be meaningfully link with a fundamental unresolved problem of family relationship
