this be no damn holiday beckworth get busy yes sir beckworth leave the tent below he could see the bright torch light the riverbank he glance back the colonel crouch tensely on one of the fold chair methodically tear at he thumbnail the bombproof be a low-ceilinged structure of heavy timber cover with earth it stand some fifty pace from the edge of the bank from the outside it seem no more than a low drumlin a lump on the dark earth a crude ladder run down to a wooden floor two slit enable observer to watch across the river the place smell strongly of rank fertile earth rot wood and urine the plank floor be slime beneath watson s boot at least the union officer have be decent enough to provide a candle there be no place to sit but watson walk slowly from the ladder to the window slit and back stoop slightly to avoid strike he head on the heavy beam in the corner be the soldier with the white flag he stand stiffly erect clutch the staff he body half hide by the limp cloth watson hardly look at he the man have come flounder aboard the flat-bottomed barge at the last instant brandish the flag of truce someone have haul he over the side and he have remain silent while they cross an officer with a squad of man have be wait on the bank the man in the boat have start yell happily at first sight of the officer two of they call he billy when the boat have touch the weak one and the two wound man have be lift out and carry away by the soldier watson have present he pouch and be lead to the bombproof the officer have tell he that both list must be check watson have give he name and ask for a safe-conduct pass the officer surprise say he would have to see watson have nod absently and mutter that he would check the list himself late he have peer through the darkness at the rampart the man he would take back across the river stand there but he turn away from they he want no part of the emotion of the exchange no memory of the joy and gratitude that other man feel he have hope to be alone in the bombproof but the soldier have follow he though watson carefully ignore the man he could not deny he presence perhaps it would be good to speak to he since silence could not exorcise he form watson glance briefly at he see only a body rigidly erect behind the languid banner we will nt be too long if i pass be approve i may be a half hour the soldier answer in a curious muffle voice he lip barely move watson turn away and do not see the man s knee buckle and he body sag yes sir he have acknowledge the man it be easy to think now watson decide the stiff figure in the corner no long block he thought he pace slowly stoop stare at the damp slippery floor he try to order the word of the three union officer seek to create some coherent portrait of the dead boy but he grope blindly he lack of success steadily erode he interest he stop pace lean against the dank timber wall and let he mind drift a feel of futility an enervation of mind great than any fatigue he have ever know seep through he what in the name of god be he do crouch in a timber pit on the wrong bank of the river why have he cross the dark water to bring back a group of reclaim soldier or to skulk in a foul-smelling hole he grow annoy and at the same time surprise at that emotion he be conscious of a grow sense of absurdity hillman have write it all out have nt he be nt the report official enough what do he hope to accomplish here hillman have order he not to leave the far bank prompt by a guilty urge he have disobey the order of a man he respect for what to tell john something he would find out for himself the figure in the corner belch loudly a deep liquid eruption watson snort and then laugh aloud exactly the soldier s voice be muffle again stricken with chagrin he clutch the staff and he dark eye blink apologetically scuse i sir let s get out of here watson run up the ladder and stand for a second suck in the cool air that smell of mud and river weed to he leave the two skiff dent they sharp bow into the soft bank the flat-bottomed boat swing slowly to the pull of the current a soldier hold the end of a fray rope three union guard appear carry they rifle at ready watson stare at they curiously they be stocky man well feed and clean-shaven with neat uniform and sturdy boot behind they shamble a long column of weak tattered man the thin gray figure raise a hoarse caw cry like the call of a bird flock they move toward the skiff with shock eagerness elbow and shove four man be knock down but do not attempt to rise they creep down the muddy slope toward the wait boat the union soldier ground arm and settle into healthy indifferent posture to watch the feeble board of the skiff the crawl man try to rise and fall again no one move to they watson watch two of they flounder into the shallow water and listen to they voice beg shrilly in a confuse soak and stumble shift of body and lift arm the two man be drag into the same skiff the third crawl man force himself erect he sway like a drunkard he arm mill in slow circle he pace forward unsteadily lean too far back he head tilt oddly he step be short and stiff and with he head throw back he progress be a supercilious strut he appear to be peer haughtily down he nose at the crowd and unclean vessel that would carry he to freedom he stalk into the water and fall heavily over the side of the flat-bottomed barge he weight nearly swamp the craft watson look for the fourth man he have reach the three passive guard he creep in an incertain manner pat the ground before he the guard do not look at he the figure on the earth halt seemingly bewilder he sink back on he thin haunch like a weary hound then he begin to crawl again watson watch the creep figure he feel a spectator interest would the man make it or not if only there be a clock for he to crawl against if he fail to reach the riverbank in five minute say then the skiff would pull away and leave he grope in the mud say three minute to make it sport still the guard do not move but stand inert aloof from the slow-scrambling man the figure halt and watson gasp the man begin to creep in the wrong direction deceive by a slight rise in the ground he turn slowly and begin to crawl back up the bank toward the rampart watson race for he he boot slam the soft earth the guard come to life with astonish menace they spin and fling they rifle up watson gesticulate wildly one man drop to he knee for good aim let i help he for the love of god the guard lower they rifle and they rifle and peer at watson with sullen puzzle face watson pound to the crawl man and stop pant heavily he reach down and close he finger on the man s upper arm beneath he clutch a flat strip of muscle surge on the bone watson bend awkwardly and lift the man to he foot watson stare into a cadaverous face two clot ball the color of mucus roll between fiery lid light stick of finger the tip gummy with dark earth pat at watson s throat the man s voice be a sweet patient whisper henry say that he d take i arm and get i right there but you ai nt henry no it do nt matter be it far how far could it be watson think bleakly how far can a blind man crawl another body length or all the rest of he nighted life not far you talk deep not like we fella it raise the voice bein in camp you secesh yes come on now can you walk why course i can i can walk real good watson stumble down the bank the man lean he frail body against watson s shoulder he be no heavy than a child watson pause for breath the man wheeze weakly he fetid breath beat softly against watson s neck he sweet whisper come after great effort oh christ i wish you be henry he promise to take i hush we re almost there watson support the man to the edge of the bank and pass the frail figure over the bow of the near skiff the man sway on a thwart turn he ruine eye from side to side watson turn away sicken for the first time in many month he hear the patient voice call henry where be you henry make he lie down watson snatch a deep breath he have not mean to shout he stand with he back to the skiff the man mew and scratch beg to be take away watson speak bewilderedly to the dark night fleck with pine-knot torch goddamn you what do you do to they intelligence jab at he accusingly he be angry sicken he have not feel that during the afternoon no nor late all he emotion have be inward self-conscious in war on a night like this it be only the outward emotion that matter what could be fling out into the darkness to damage other yes that be it he be sure of it john s
