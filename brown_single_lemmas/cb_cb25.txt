the most surprise thing about the twenty-second congress of the soviet communist party be that it be surprise perhaps quite a much in it own way a the twentieth congress of 1956 which end with that famous secret report on stalin the publication last july of the party s draft program that blueprint for the transition to communism have lead the uninitiated to suppose that this twenty-second congress would be a sort of apotheosis of the khrushchev regime a solemn consecration of idea which have in fact be current over the last three or four year ie since the defeat of the anti-party group in all theoretical party journal these never cease to suggest that if in the eye of marx and lenin full communism be still a very distant ideal the establishment of a communist society have now under khrushchev become an immediate and tangible reality it seem that khrushchev himself take a very special pride in have make a world-shaking contribution to marxist doctrine with he draft program a large part of he twelve-hour speech at the recent congress be in fact very largely a rehash of that interminable document he and other soviet leader responsible for the document be proud of have bring forward some new formula such a the early replacement of the dictatorship of the proletariat by an all people s state and also of have lay down the line for a much great democratization of the whole hierarchy of soviet start with the supreme soviet itself they plan for rotation of leader promise a salutary blow at bureaucracy and would enable the people to take a more direct and active part in run the country also election would be more democratic there might even be two or more candidate for voter to choose from no doubt there be still a lot in the draft program and in khrushchev s speech which leave many point obscure be it the party s intention for example to abolish gradually the kolkhoz system and replace it by uniformly wage-earning kolkhozes ie state farm which be moreover to be progressively urbanize a we know the soviet peasant today still very largely thrive on be able to sell the produce grow on he private plot and it be still very far from certain how valid the party s claim be that in a grow number of kolkhozes the peasant be find it more profitable to surrender they private plot to the kolkhoz and to let the latter be turn into something increasingly like a state farm if one follow the report of the congress one find that there still seem considerable uncertainty in the mind of the leader themselves about what exactly to do in this matter the draft program be interest in other respect too it contain for example a number of curious admission about the peasant who enjoy no sickness benefit no old-age pension no pay holiday they still benefit far less than the other 50 per cent of the nation from that welfare state which the soviet union so greatly pride itself on be over all these fairly awkward problem khrushchev be to skate rather lightly and though he repeat over and over again the spectacular figure of industrial and agricultural production in 1980 the ordinary people in russia be still a little uncertain a to how communism be really go to work in practice especially in respect of food would agriculture progress a rapidly a industry this be something on which k himself seem to have some doubt for he keep on threaten that he would pull the ear of those responsible for agricultural production and a we know the virgin land be not produce a much a khrushchev have hope one can not but wonder whether these doubt about the success of khrushchev s agricultural policy have not at least something to do with one of the big surprise provide by this congress the obsessive harp on the crime and misdeed of the anti-party group molotov malenkov kaganovich and other include the eighty-year-old marshal voroshilov molotov in particular be be charge with all kind of sin especially with want to cut down free public service to increase rent and fare in fact with have be against all the more popular feature of the khrushchev welfare state the trouble with all these doctrinal quarrel be that we hear only one side of the story what in the secret council of the kremlin molotov have really propose we just do nt know and he have have no chance to reply but one can not escape the suspicion that all this non-stop harp on the misdeed of the long liquidate anti-party group would be totally unnecessary if there be not inside the party some secret but genuine opposition to khrushchev on vital doctrinal ground on the actual method to be employ in the transition to communism and last but not least on foreign policy the whole problem of peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition with the capitalist world be in the very center of this congress mikoyan declare molotov altogether reject the line of peaceful coexistence reduce this concept merely to the state of peace or rather the absence of war at a give moment and to a denial of the possibility of avert a world war he view in fact coincide with those of foreign enemy of peaceful coexistence who look upon it merely a a variant of the cold war or of an arm peace one can not help wonder whether molotov and the rest of the anti-party group be not be use a china s whipping-boys by khrushchev and he faithful follower for something clearly have go very very seriously wrong in soviet-chinese relation which be never easy and have now deteriorate the effect of chou en-lai s clash with khrushchev together with the everlasting attack on molotov & co have shift the whole attention of the world include that of the soviet people from the epoch-making twenty-year program to the present soviet-chinese conflict not only a we know do chou en-lai publicly treat khrushchev s attack on albania a something that we can not consider a a serious marxist-leninist approach to the problem ie a something thoroughly dictatorial and undemocratic but the albanian leader go out of they way to be openly abusive to khrushchev call he a liar a bully and so on it be extremely doubtful that the handful of albanian who call themselves communist could have do this without the direct approval of they chinese friend the big question be whether in the name of a restore chinese-soviet solidarity the chinese will choose to persuade the albanian to present they humble apology to khrushchev or get rid of enver hoxa these seem about the only two way in which the unhappy incident can now be close but albania be merely a symptom of a real malaise between china and russia there be other symptom khrushchev for all he bombastic prophecy about the inevitable decay of capitalism be genuinely favorable to peaceful coexistence and would like above all the berlin and german problem to be settle peacefully he know that he be never more popular than at the time of the russo-american honeymoon of 1959 but it seem that pressure against he be come from somewhere in the first place from china but perhaps also from that china lobby which i be assure in moscow nearly two year ago exist on the quiet inside the party to these people solidarity and unity with china should be the real basis of russia s future policy and the chinese a the albanian incident show have strong suspicion that khrushchev be anxious to secure a shameful peace with the west the fact that china which be obsess by formosa to khrushchev a very small matter should be support by north korea and north vietnam be highly indicative and one can not but wonder whether marshal malinovsky who be blow hot and cold exalt peace but also almost openly consider the possibility of preventive war against the west be nt try to keep the chinese quiet and this bring we inevitably to the 30 - or 50-megaton bomb be not this drop primarily in order to appease the chinese especially after khrushchev s humiliate surrender to the west in canceling the german peace-treaty deadline of december 31 what do it all add up to indication be that khrushchev and with he the bulk of the soviet people favor peaceful coexistence and with the exception of berlin the maintenance of the status quo in the world the chinese north vietnamese and north korean on the other hand feel that militarily russia be strong enough to support they in the just war of liberation they would like to embark on before long with china attack formosa and the north korean and north vietnamese liberate the southern half of they respective country perhaps khrushchev be in a more difficult position than any since 1957 when the anti-party group nearly liquidate he he seem strong enough inside the party to cope with any internal opposition but if he be up against china s crusade spirit in world affair he be go to be face with the most agonize choice in he life he may support china but he will nt he may break with china which would be infernally difficult and perhaps disastrous or he may succeed by all kind of dangerous concession in persuade china to be patient the next day may show where thing stand on a misty sunday morning last month a small band of militant anti-communist call the minuteman hold maneuver in a foggy field about fifteen mile east of here eleven man a woman and a teen-age boy tramp over cold damp fog-enshrouded ground during a two-hour field drill in the problem of guerrilla warfare to the average american this must sound like an incredible tale from a saturday night tv movie but to the minuteman this be a serious business they feel that the unite state be engage in a life-and-death struggle with communism for survival and world supremacy they feel that world war 3 have already begin and they be set themselves up a a last line of defense against the communist advance they national leader robert bolivar depugh of norborne mo say the minuteman believe that guerrilla tactic be good suit to defeat the red onslaught in they maneuver last month they wear world war 2 camouflage garb and
