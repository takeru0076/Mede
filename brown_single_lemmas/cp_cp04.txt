 he must have forgive i henrietta murmur to the room the absolution of doaty s last will and testament be proof enough of that doaty would never have leave she house to a godless woman she find herself wish an old wish that she have tell doaty she be run away that she have leave something more behind she than the love sorry note and she good garnet pin perhaps doaty have guess already and keep she counsel henrietta think it s extraordinary how much she always know about both of we there have be more to know about hetty inevitably and most of it unfavorable adelia be the good one or if not always good less frequently tempt they childhood would have be quite circumspect without hetty s flair for drama especially through the long summer in winter in the city there have be the maneret school which teach excellently with a kind of austere passion for knowledge there have be lesson in french from a small polish nobleman with a really profound distaste for he pupil there have be the dance class miss craddock thin and tireless with she supervise wand and she everlasting one-two-three one-two-three there have be supper party and tea fete and little ball mama small and pretty and gay and papa enormously jocular enormously possessive the sun around which the blackwell planet revolve mama have die before the corruption of the family circle the interruption of charles it be safe to assume that papa sigh heavily have say many time to he remain daughter thank god you poor mother be spare this and indeed it might be true that it have be easy for henrietta to leave with she hand in charles hand just because she poor mother be go already and would never know mama be vulnerable one have always feel the need to make a safe world around she but i would have go anyway think henrietta she have always be able to ignore the moral question because there have be no choice only at this moment perhaps because it be before dawn and she be lie in doaty s bed she find herself examine how other might regard she perhaps they would argue that morality consist just of that ability to see a choice she turn on she side find the idea oppressive if adelia have feel about someone a henrietta feel about charles would she have run away with he impossible to imagine adelia feel so about anyone no temptation no sin no temptation no virtue a curious think to end a curious night the bird be really awake now in a colloquy of music and light be begin to creep across the room touch sill and door table and chair and all of doaty s flower in they artificial blossom and leaf before anything else she would go to doaty s grave with flower from doaty s forget garden everything must wait upon this mission this sentimental duty of a pilgrim whose nature avoid graveyard she close she eye remember the small french cemetery enclose by stone wall it have always seem to rain there and even the grass be gray after the sad impatient moment wait for comfort which could not come she slip out of bed and go to the open window the garden below be lacy with dew and enchanting in it small wildness lean out she could see a tangle of rosebush and honeysuckle one not quite come to bloom one just beyond it on a thrust spray thick with thorn and dewdrop and swell pink bud like a summer valentine a bird balance and sing nondescriptly word and alive with it own music a little engine of song it be so pretty and artless that she feel like a child again and would have enjoy run out barefoot to play on the wet grass with all the grow thing but doaty never permit bare foot and she be decidedly not a child but une femme dun certain age feel suddenly neat and subdue she dress quite soberly and go downstairs rosa unbelievably be not yet up and about reassurance that rosa be human feel protective toward this sleep be henrietta find a yesterday bun and milk in a white jug a breakfast which be somewhat the equivalent of go barefoot outside the garden the tame wilderness yield a patchwork bouquet of daisy sweet william scent stock and lady s bedstraw which she tie with long grass and take back to show rosa who be now stir about the kitchen and harangue folly the poodle come gleefully to henrietta and beg for the flower supplicate the air with prayerful forepaw henrietta hold she bouquet out of reach and say it be for doaty rummage in the dew say rosa coldly go change you shoe before you turn around she sound so exactly like doaty that henrietta obey she under the clear impression that she could either comply or stay home folly dance eager for whatever lie beyond the door to a blackwell there be only one church the cemetery slumber just behind it and the way lie through the village and close to the sea for the first time in thirty year henrietta walk down the narrow street with it shuttered shop just stir and it inhabitant eie she with the frank curiosity she smile and bow recall the princess-in-a-carriage feel she have enjoy when she be a child now some of the acknowledgment be cautious but all be interest an old man sit against the wall of a cottage and wait for the sun to find he give she a more than reflective look a she pass the sap still plainly rise in he branch on an impulse she turn back and say good morning he cup he ear and shake he head at she repetition announce in a nettle way that he have hear she the first time he then offer he own estimate of the weather which be unenthusiastic summer s be slow to come he say it s i dryin out time he scowl at she flower i m take they to the cemetery say henrietta out of a vague feel of hospitality they ll be takin i next he say pleasantly but not so soon s they plan see half of em in they grave before i choose i own coffin it s dryin myself out that do it he regard she with rise hope you d like to hear how i go about it it s nice of you henrietta say doubtfully y re welcome he straighten himself soldierly against the wall and pull he sprawl foot together so they stand side by side in they old boot he stick cease to be a thing to rest he chin on and become a pointer for emphasize the fine aspect of he text every month fr three day he say happily i take no water into i system no water whatsoever it rest the tissue henrietta murmur that she could quite see how it would and he nod approval of she womanly good sense rest the tissue he say and pacify the system i dad do it and he live to a great age he look up at she sharply do nt remember do you she do suddenly through the link of memory with he father old titus who must have be in he nineties when henrietta run away next to the blackwells titus have own the island most and she and adelia have often stand in front of he silence by he terrible year a scanty man with a thin beard and very deep-set blue eye like a mariner more age than possible he have never speak once to the awe sister but he son have be friendly a big fellow of fifty or more a fishing-boat captain and powerful like the sea it must be that son who sit before she now shriveled to half he size and half he sense she say gently of course i remember you not so well s i remember you he say y re the young blackwell woman run away on a black night with a lawful wed man i know all about you you do seem to say henrietta impress can nt blame a man for leavin he wife he say quite cheerfully leave i many a time only she never know it man in a boat there s a lot of place he can put in at and a lot of reason he can be away for a bit any harm in that probably say henrietta dryly he give a short hard laugh and look at she knowingly you d be the one to say he observe and she find herself like he approval none too well but she could not defend herself and say that she action be different since all action have they own law only this old man s connivance be even less to she taste than selma cotter s open censure well she have not come back to great island to be understand praise or condemn she have come to make she peace with the past and of that past this ancient of the earth be only a kind of shadow she start to move away just a a woman come out of the cottage a big-boned drab-haired figure with a clean apron tie over she limp print dress she smile vaguely at henrietta and speak to the old man you ve not have you breakfast yet grandad yr dam porridge be no breakfast he say milk and sop he beat the air with he stick and it fall from he claw and clatter on the stone he s lowly today he grand-daughter say wearily and bend to pick it up he s get this idea about dry out it ai nt an idea if it ai nt an idea she say how come it you can drink beer but not water he look piously to heaven and say beer do nt affect the tissue none and the ingenious hypocrisy of this defense please henrietta so that she forgive he he stint of malevolence he grand-daughter sigh come on do the child be eat and miss blackwell s on she way somewheres to the graveyard who ai nt not i i ve get a day s work to do you ll be visit miss doaty maam henrietta nod how much they know about she the woman she must have be a tiny baby when hetty and delia have stand arm in arm watch great age grow small answer the nod with she own god rest she soul she be a sweet one come on now she put a strong hand under the old man s arm and lift he up patiently with the gentle cruelty and necessary tyranny that the young show toward the very old he mumble at she but let himself be lead off inside the house shuffle mightily to make it clear how weak and age he be and how he be buffete about by those who still have they wicked strength there be a gabble of voice from indoors young hungry sound like cat after fish and a burst of swear from the old man henrietta look down at she bouquet still lively with it color and scent and set she foot on they journey s way again leave the village street and cross the first field folly dance ahead of she at the edge of the field the wild roll land take over dot with fat round bush like sheep they be cover with tiny white blossom they scant root claw at the stony ground and wild bird dart in and about and through they so they be nearly alive with the rustle and cry the air be full of sound too but placid one a terrestrial hum a much out of the earth a out of the blue sky she feel mindless walk and almost easy until the church spire tell she she be near the cemetery and she catch herself wonder what she would say to doaty both church and graveyard be small than she remember they how many thing have lessen while she be go away but the headstone have grow so thick in thirty year that to find one name dorothy tredding seem suddenly impossible she sit down on the near fall with age and gray with sea-damp she finger trace the indecipherable carve letter pad with green moss the day s sun be gather it strength in gold and she wish she have bring she parasol if only to shade doaty s flower a small rock-carved angel watch she from a nearby tomb the only angel in the cemetery she remember suddenly a night of savage moonlight and scud cloud when she and adelia have dare each other have steal out of they great safe house and come here hand in hand hope and fear ghost
