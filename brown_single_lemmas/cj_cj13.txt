some of the feature of the top portion of figure 1 and figure 2 be mention in discuss table 1 first the onset profile spread across approximately 12 year for boy and 10 year for girl in contrast 20 of the 21 line in the completion profile exclude center 5 for boy and 4 for girl be bunch and extend over a much short period approximately 30 month for boy and 40 month for girl the maturity chart for each sex demonstrate clearly that onset be a phenomenon of infancy and early childhood whereas completion be a phenomenon of the late portion of adolescence second for both sex the 21 transverse line in the onset profile vary more in individual spread than those in the completion profile although the standard deviation value on which spread of the line be base be relatively large for those center which begin to ossify early table 1 there be considerable difference in this value between center have the closely time onsets third the process of calcification be see to begin late and to continue much long for these boy than for the girl a fact which confirm data for other group of child the onset profile and completion profile be construct to serve a norm for child it be convenient to classify a child s onset age and completion age a advance moderate modal or delay accord to whether the child s age equivalent dot appear to the leave of upon or to the right of the appropriate short transverse line when a dot appear close to the end of the transverse line the moderate rate may be far classify accord to the position of the dot with respect to the vertical mark denote the mean age such classification may be call somewhat advance or somewhat delay a the case may be reserve moderate for dot upon or close to the mean in the low portion of each chart the skeletal age hand of boy 34 and girl 2 may be similarly classify there the middle one of the three curve denote mean skeletal age for the maturity series boy and girl the upper curve denote the mean plus one standard deviation and the low curve represent the mean minus one standard deviation thus a child s skeletal age dot may be classify a advance when they appear above the middle curve moderate when they appear immediately above or below the middle curve and delay when they appear below the low curve to summarize the purpose of the skeletal maturity chart each contain two kind of skeletal maturity norm which show two quite different method of depict developmental level of growth center first the upper portion require series of film for every child consist of those from hand elbow shoulder knee and foot the low portion necessitate only film of hand second the upper portion permit comparison of maturity level of an equal number of growth center from the long short and round bone of the five region the low portion permit comparison of maturity level of short and round bone predominantly since only two long bone be include in hand and wrist a a region third the upper portion deal with only two indicator of developmental level onset and completion the low portion utilize the full complement of intermediate maturity indicator of each hand center a well a they onset and completion fourth the two indicator be for the most part widely separate chronologically with the extensive age gap occur during childhood for all but one growth center the low portion provide a rate at any stage between infancy and adulthood onsets completion and skeletal age hand of boy 34 and girl 2 may be directly compare and classify use only those skeletal age which appear immediately below the onset profile and the completion profile it may be assume that difference in rating due to selection of growth center from specific region of the body will be small accord to exist table of onset age and completion age for center throughout the body accordingly maturity level rating by mean of the upper portion and low portion of the chart respectively should be somewhat similar since skeletal age assessment be dependent upon onsets during infancy and upon completion during adolescence it be clear that there be some difference in the rating but there be substantial agreement since a skeletal age rate can be make at any age during growth from elbow shoulder knee or foot a well a hand it seem to be the method of choice when one wish to study most aspect of skeletal developmental progress during childhood a state early in the paper onsets and completion particularly the former provide a different tool or indicator of expectancy in osseous development each within a limit age period such an indicator or indicator be need a mean of recognize specific period of delay in skeletal developmental progress it be state early that one purpose of this study be to extend the analysis of variability of onset and completion in each of the 21 growth center somewhat beyond that provide by the data in table 1 and 2 a one approach to do this figure 3 and 4 have be construct from the mean age and the individual onset and completion age for boy 34 and girl 2 the difference between onset age and completion age with respect to the correspond mean age have be bring into juxtaposition by mean of a series of arrow the data for boy 34 appear in figure 3 and for girl 2 in figure 4 the number system use in table 1 and 2 and figure 1 and 2 be continue for the 21 growth center the dot on one end of each arrow indicate extent of difference in month between the child s onset age and the correspond mean age for the growth center the tip of the arrow represent extent of difference between the child s completion age and the correspond mean age for the growth center thus the alignment of the dot and tip respectively indicate individual variability of the 21 growth center of each child with respect to the mean value for these boy and girl the direction in which the arrow point show how the maturity level of the growth center be change at completion from the level at onset when the dot and tip coincide the classification use in this paper be same schedule the length of the arrow indicate amount of slow or acceleration at completion over that at onset and the difference in month can be read roughly by refer the arrow to the age scale along the base of each figure or more precisely by refer to the original data in the appropriate table the difference between the sequence of onset of ossification for the sex govern the number sequence in figure 3 and 4 this difference be readily clarify by refer to table 1 for example arrow 17 in figure 3 portray the proximal radial epiphysis for boy 34 whereas the same epiphysis for girl 2 be portray by arrow 18 in figure 4 for the boy this epiphysis be markedly delay at onset but near the mean at completion thus the span of it ossification be shorten and the center s ability to catch up in ossification be demonstrate in contrast for the girl the epiphysis be slightly advance at onset and delay at completion obviously the slow for she may have occur at any point between onset and completion the skeletal age curve in the low portion of figure 2 show that slow may have occur for she during the prepubescent period length of the shaft of these arrow may be evaluate accord to the standard deviation value for each center in table 1 we have attempt to simplify the extensive task of analyze onset age and completion age of each child more than 1700 value for the entire group by construct figure for each of the 21 center so that the data for all 34 boy and 34 of the girl will appear together for each growth center figure 5 and 6 be example of we method of analyze the result for each growth center forty other figure similar to 5 and 6 and the original data use in the construction of all figure and table in this monograph have be include in the appendix the principle use in make each arrow for figure 3 and 4 be apply to the construction of figure 5 and 6 a well a all figure in the appendix one growth center in a short bone distal phalanx of the second finger be choose a an example for discussion here primarily because epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion the maturity indicator for completion in long and short bone occur in this center for girl near the menarche and for boy near they comparable pubescent stage it completion thus become one of the convenient maturity indicator to include in study of growth dietary pattern and health during adolescence the follow summary base on figure 5 and 6 be an example of one way of interpret the 42 figure construct from onset age and completion age of individual child with respect to the appropriate mean age for each growth center at the top of figure 5 for example the onset range and completion range line for the choose growth center have be draw for girl accord to they mean and standard deviation value in table 1 the 34 arrow denote onset age plus completion age deviation have be array in an onset sequence which begin with girl 18 who have the early onset of the 34 girl the growth center depict here in the distal phalanx of the second finger be list a the fifth of those in the seven short bone the mean onset age be 253 month table 1 and the average span of the osseous stage be 133 month the correlation table 2 between onset age and completion age be -50 and that between onset age and span be -10 with due consideration for the limit of precision in assess expect rate of change in ossification of girl age 2 year and the know variation in rate of ossification of these child a describe in we precede paper in the supplement each arrow with a shaft length of four month or less be select a indicate same schedule at onset and completion for this particular epiphysis accordingly girl 31 29 33 21 26 13 3 4 14 32 24 25 34 23 6 15 22 and 16 may be say to have the same schedule at onset and completion it seem clear from the counter-balance shape of the series of arrow in figure 5 that there be about an equal number of early and late onsets and completion for the 34 girl accordingly if epiphyseal-diaphyseal fusion occur in this phalanx near menarche early and late menarches might have be forecast rather precisely at the time of onset of ossification for the 18 girl with same schedule a an example of the interpretation of an arrow in the figure which exceed four month in shaft length in conjunction with it position in the figure girl 2 have a delay onset and far delay completion it be of interest that she menarche be somewhat late than the average for the girl in this group a similar analysis of figure 6 for the 34 boy would necessitate quite a different conclusion about the predictive value of onset age in forecast they attainment of the pubescent stage boy 32 23 31 17 30 19 and 24 have same schedule at onset and completion thus early forecast of the pubescent stage would appear possible for only seven boy boy 34 like girl 2 do not have same schedule he arrow cross the line denote the mean the dot on he arrow indicate early onset and the tip indicate relatively late completion after the 42 figure have be draw like figure 5 and 6 classification of the onset age and completion age be summarize from they
