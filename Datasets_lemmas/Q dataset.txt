activity most schedule and plan solution be base on time task and resource manage- ment in this work we consider the scenario of so-called “soft” plan which assume the exact time of activity might be unknown and dependent on flex- ible condition we conceptualize the project with the help of such instrument a common-sense ontology domain-specific ontology software requirement visu- alization and visual statechart formalism this particular contribution focus on the challenge of develop a mobile notification service for manage activity “pre-programmed” by the user in which notification be issue if the user enter a location suitable for implement the desire defer action the suggest ontology-based model do not assume use or improve formal optimal time or task schedule but suggest an approach for informal practical computer-assisted decision-making involve typical scenario appear in everyday life we pilote a number of prototype for location-based user-oriented reminder setup and notifi- cation management partially fit the requirement and major scenario of a soft plan system base on the experiment with the develop prototype app for android we elicit a number of important aspect of far

approach to link the current context to a sit- uation which might be distant in time or/and location while this context in turn can be “pre-programmed” by the user a a description of a defer action to be implement late 3 “soft planning” revisit the concept 31 situational plan by example here be some model scenario illustrate the concept of soft plan 1 someone realize that some product or household item be miss at home fig- ure 1 it be not so urgent that one must go to find it immediately instead it might be helpful to be remind while the person in charge be in or nearby the particular store where this item can be find thus exact time or even location might be unknown figure 1 soft plan in shop 2 a traveler discover an interest sightsee spot which be worth visit at a late date figure 2 thus the exact time frame for a visit might be unknown but a reminder could be helpful to describe a kind of defer activity that can be suggest a soon a it happen that the traveler be nearby this location again for example drive in the area because of some business but in a good season figure 2 soft plan while travel 3 a theatre or cinema lover would like to watch a particular performance maybe still unreleased a soon a it become available for watch or book 4 a householder need to do some housework where specific time be unknown or not so important the reminder could be helpful but only while be at home 32 conceptualization it be commonly agree that conceptualization be an important process which often involve ontology-based approach for system design and requirement engineering stage 262728 construct an ontology model help in eliminate redundant infor- mation and define project scope good a a conceptual core of the whole project the common-sense ontology be link to domain-specific ontology and provide ground figure 3 iteration in model conceptualization for requirement elicitation software prototyp help we to refine the requirement and revisit the ontology model a well and improve we understand of the system scope and boundary figure 3 figure 4 soft plan system common-sense ontology revise against 18 figure 4 illustrate the conceptual model of soft plan through construct a common-sense ontology the user’s activity situation and idea influence the plan where the user be involve in the activity and the activity be contextualize by the situa- tion and suggest by the system the user define the desire reminder through condi- tion or property the common-sense ontology can be naturally connect to the sub- ject domain ontology such a one in figure 5 provide ground to discover major entity to be modele in the system and they key relationship the condition of the reminder in this system be mainly determine by the time and location the location consist of a current location and a programme location the latter be the location generate by the system accord to the suggest model the reminder set by the user be assume to belong to the follow major class figure 5 domain-specific entity 1 active reminder be to be configure by the user and process by the system so that when the appropriate user condition such a be near the desire loca- tion be fulfil the system issue a notification 2 template be reminder configuration store in the system for future use to fa- cilitate the future notification setup the template be assume to be configure partially or suggest by the system for common or frequent scenario 3 suspend reminder be those delay by the user for suspend reminder the user may need specific configuration option refer to the early establish policy such a reactivate the reminder after a certain period of time reactivate it manually or even notify the user about the exist suspend action 4 archive reminder may be useful for the case if the user wish to save the previously configure reminder for future reactivation instead of trash they 33 major use case figure 6 show the major scenario to be support by this system 34 reminder and notification workflow base on reminder status definition we define two major stage of reminder set and notification management present in figure 7– 8 use the statechart behavioral model base on harel’s statechart formalism 29 figure 6 major use case in the soft plan system figure 7 draft the superstate set and configure a reminder describe major event and action to create a reminder manage the list of active and archive reminder save or delete reminder figure 8 sketch the superstate work with issue notification support such transaction a “forgetting” the reminder archive it keep it active or re-configure it thus trigger the system back to the superstate set and configure a reminder 4 pilote prototype lesson learn to improve we understand of the project goal and challenge to resolve we experi- mented with several prototype implementation develop a android application ex- perimental component partially address the use case present in figure 6 this section describe the lesson learn a a result of experiment with develop prototype 41 geofencing in the context of soft plan the tricky problem of situational plan scenario implementation be to assure that relevant notification be issue in connection to specific location to achieve this location-based service such a geofences be require geofences define virtual geo- graphic boundary usually connect to some point of interest and enable register application to trigger response when a mobile device enter or leave a particular area see for example 30 geofences can be set with geographic coordinate geometric figure 7 set a reminder figure 8 work with issue notification parameter such a radius for circular geofences duration and transition type they be often connect with the point of vision while construct travel itinerary and tourist guide 31 figure 9 illustrate the main scenario and the main eventual issue use the geometry-based distance to decide on notification upon enter the geofence area might lead to annoy and unreliable notification or never-ending re- minder therefore it be important to elicit a number of aspect to be take into the consideration while implement a practical location-based notification service 1 recommendation and proximity evaluation may differ significantly depend on the mean of transportation 2 landscape characteristic especially while walk or cycle may affect user’s wish to proceed with the suggest defer activity figure 9 location-based scenario plan → geofencing → action 3 possible wait time or preliminary book require at the recommend loca- tion could make a suggestion hard to follow 4 use programme reminder together with a reason engine may be helpful for get some more information about “softly” plan activity refer to a selection of possible location rather than to a specific one like “any food store” but not a particular one 5 conversion of a remind activity to a regular plan to be include in the calendar or time scheduler might need integration with popular time management service we use a combination of system alarm calendar and notification for point-in- time and time-period reminder and add voice input and cloud sync to make it easy to use for location-based reminder we use a combination of google’s geofence and cloud service to synchronize the geofence coordinate create in the database with the cloud the system can send the correspond notification when the user enter or leave the register geofence it be helpful for far debug and evaluation 42 third-party service the follow third-party service be show to be helpful for develop a prototype implementation 1 iflytek speech recognition – the component be use to recognize short audio and convert into text in real time 32 thus support voice input 2 google geofence – geofencing combine awareness of the user’s current location with awareness of the user’s proximity to location that may be of interest33 it be use for create location-based notification 3 nutstore webdav – use webdav and firebase34 help in backing-up the configure reminder information to ensure that user can change or use it multi- ple device support such option a direct online edit version control and collaborative editing35 the data synchronize component use a cloud service that support webdav protocol the advantage of such an architecture be that the developer do not need to develop a separate server-side program however the user need to be register with the cloud service provider 43 client environment the proof-of-concept client application run under android 100 run-time environ- ment be develop use java and kotlin 5 conclusion and future work the scenario of soft plan may be consider a an element of activity-centric com- puting paradigm address the multi-faceted nature of human activity in the real world when people tend to create “activity representation that be simple yet flexible enough to accommodate different level of rigidity” 36 and “re-program” they future experi- ence base on the feedback they may have from the current activity or from the experi- ence of other user there be a number of issue require far effort to move the project towards it practical use • identification of possible useful scenario of user collaboration in set and use “soft” plan • integration of soft planner with regular time scheduler and activity organizer • possibility to apply knowledge-based recommendation and nlp algorithm so that to identify and suggest the suitable scenario to the user semi-automatically though the current stage of the project do not involve sufficient arguable experi- mental result to contrast the approach against the exist human-centric solution usu- ally actively involve machine learn algorithm we believe that the present con- ceptualization create ground for improve personalize service and environment for practical ubiquitous time and activity management
