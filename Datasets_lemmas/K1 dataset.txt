computational model problem conceptualization abstract—though the study of rich metaphor hide in the musical composition lie mostly in scope of art and musicology there be still large space for formal method base on mathe- matical model and computer technology that can be helpful in discover complementary insight to how the composition be structure what be it relationship to the precursors’ work and how it affect the late work of the same or other author we idea be to investigate how computational model can enhance musicology research on music style identification and comparative analysis use the case study of tchaikovsky’s children’s album keywords–musicology music information retrieval human- centric compute similarity music modele i introduction in i recent talk on jan 6th 2021 in the university of aizu “tchaikovsky children’s album time metaphor rediscoveries” 1 i discuss the phenomenon of piotr tchaikovsky’s “children’s album” for piano solo op 39 2 this masterpiece be compose and publish a far a in 1878 but today it still remain one of constant topic of interest for researcher 3 4 though the study of rich metaphor hide in the piece think to be for child rather lie in the scope of art and musicology there be still a large research space for formal method base on mathematical and computational model which may give additional insight into we under- stand of the structure and organization of the whole work it relationship to precursor such a “43 clavierst ̈ucke f ̈ur die jugend” by robert schumann 5 a well a the reason for significant difference between the original manuscript and the first publish edition surprisingly in musicology literature one of the first careful study of transformation between the manuscript and the publish edition can be find in the early 1990s only thus more than 100 year after the whole work be complete 6 7 these study mostly remain in scope of music and art theory with almost no involvement of machine learn approach today it be commonly not dispute that computer science and artificial intelligence may contribute to musicology research on music style identification and comparative analysis in this study we try to discover appropriate formal model that would enhance the analysis and understand of tchaikovsky’s “children’s album” which can be consider a a very good example of apply human- centric compute research in the frame of art and humanities where solution cannot be design within a certain context only but require intensive cross-disciplinary effort so a to bridge the community work in different context and use different vocabulary 8 ii relate work accord to nattiez music be a symbolic fact charac- terized by the complex configuration of interpretants 9 in music we use various connect but independent model include letter-based notation such a helmholz or scientific pitch notation that can be consider a simple syntax base language construction complex symbolic notation in the form of graphic note score range from hardly formalizable ancient model such a znamenny chant at one pole or relatively strict mensural notation at another pole up to modern sheet music base on many rule but give some freedom to support the individual style of composer piano roll notation tablature midi representation a well a audio signal and even spectral model such a acoustic fingerprint the great variety of model use for music representation be one of reason why music provide an interest and complex use case for experiment with information retrieval object recognition and classification algorithm music representation complexity can be explain by the presence of two array of element and relationship where the first one correspond to the element that can be treat mathematically such a pitch rhythm or harmony while the second one include non-mathematical element such a tension expectancy and emotion 10 a bridge the gap between pure musicology and apply human-centric computer technology current approach to music similarity evaluation in- cluding we own work on melody extraction and similarity estimation use earth mover’s distance algorithm 11 mostly target the search and retrieval system include well-known app such a shazam 12 without a perfect fit to the problem of stylistic similarity evaluation from this point of view model of functional representation of music harmony and harmonic similarity estimation 13 seem to be more adequate to the problem of style identification indeed usually listener can recognize similarity of composition because of they harmonic similarity see figure 1 however it do not immediately lead we to clearly conclude about the composition’s stylistic resemblance or dependency even harmonic equivalence may not be enough to recognize the melody a demonstrate in 14 and late analyze in 15 in the experiment with melody distort by substitute the note octave by randomly select one within three octave every note in the sequence keep it position on the scale but the tune vary over a three-octave range similarly to an example of such distortion show in figure 2 figure 1 harmony resemblance between beethoven’s moonlight sonata and it variation figure 2 distort note sequence of beethoven’s moonlight sonata with keep harmonic equivalence harmonic function be core element of speac music representation system develop by cope 16 17 which be an implementation of augment transition network a finite- state automaton with recursive succession rule between music sub-phrases allow for logical syntax substitution 18 cope’s speac system be base on a hierarchical representation of the structure of music composition in nest context begin from note and chord up to chapter and part see figure 3 a five identifier contribute to speac acronym stand for statement s preparation p extension e antecedent a and consequent c all of which be kind of abstraction assign to group of note “depending on level of tension between interval metrical placement and agogic emphasis measure both in the precede and follow groups” 18 succession rule define by cope limit possible transition between the speac state see figure 3 b therefore speac progression be like genome sequence use speac identifier a base enforce by harmonic tension weight and hierarchical relationship between progression at different level modele music structure use speac-analysis can be a promise approach to model music style similarity through speac progression similarity a well a similarity between the correspond graph that can be construct specifically with respect to recent implementation available a library in universal language such a python 19 due to a large number of application of use deep neural network for object recognition and classification especially for image recognition include such subjective trait a image aesthetics machine learn approach and recurrent neural network may be promise for music style identification figure 3 progression base in speac system by david cope classification and analysis though in contrast to a variety of work on computer music generation we argue that the main challenge be not to teach ai to create art object but to be able to help we in perceive object create by human 20 b rendition and implication of “children’s album” since both tchaikovsky and schumann belong to the ro- mantic tradition root in part of leitmotif music by beethoven and wagner on the one hand and in the new music language of glinka chopin and liszt on the other hand certain harmony and music development similarity surely exist in they work accord to the network of influence on classical composer originally describe by smith and georges et al in the original classical music navigator 21 schumann be one of composer who greatly influence tchaikovsky along with balakirev beethoven chopin delibes and other a show in figure 4 however admit schumann’s influence to tchaikovsky do not lead we to automatically judge the “children’s album” a an imitation of schumann’s piece for the young also with long history of edition but rather few scholarly study 23 even though tchaikovsky claim it explicitly in the subtitle for the publish edition “24 simple piece for child like schumann” but not in the manuscript 24 what if this subtle subtitle be a kind of hint that tchaikovsky give we like say “well it be definitely not “like schumann” should you then believe in the appropriateness of all make transformations” these transformation see figure 5 destroy the structure of the album a an indissociable whole and deform the micro-cycles exist in the manuscript where the doll cycle be the clear case a well a harmonic link such a between the first and the last piece in the manuscript “morning prayer” and “the hurdy-gurdy man be singing” respectively an idea that change in the order of composition between the manuscript and first publish edition be mistakenly in- troduced by the publisher could not be accept a convince enough indeed tchaikovsky approve this version nekhaeva suggest that these transformation can be consider a a “gesture of the composer a natural desire to overcome the temporary barrier and directly appeal to future generation of musicians” 4 this opinion support an exist hypothesis claim that tchaikovsky probably prefer to hide some metaphor so that they be not so explicitly expose a in the manuscript from the perspective of musicology we could not expect to find a final answer and perhaps it be not need instead a possibility to incorporate formal computational approach into informal art discourse can produce a number of important additional insight for good understand of genesis of one of tchaikovsky’s masterpiece in piano music
